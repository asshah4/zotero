We sought to determine the long-term associations of various LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) thresholds and CVD and coronary heart disease mortality in a large, low 10-year risk cohort. Methods: The study sample included participants of the CCLS (Cooper Center Longitudinal Study) without a history of CVD or diabetes mellitus and defined as low risk ({$<$}7.5\\%) for 10-year atherosclerotic CVD events at baseline based on Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. The associations of fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In 36 375 participants (72\\% men, median age 42) followed for a median of 26.8 years, 1086 CVD and 598 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. Compared with LDL-C {$<$}100 mg/dL, LDL-C categories 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, 160 to 189.9 mg/dL, and ≥190 mg/dL were associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (95\\% CI, 1.1-1.7), 1.3 (95\\% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.9 (95\\% CI, 1.5-2.4), and 1.7 (95\\% CI, 1.3-2.3), and mean reductions in years free of CVD death of 1.8, 1.1, 4.3, and 3.9, respectively. After adjustment for atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, LDL-C categories 160 to 189 mg/dL and ≥190 mg/dL remained independently associated with CVD mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95\\% CI, 1.4-2.2) and 1.5 (95\\% CI, 1.2-2.1), respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models using non-HDL-C {$<$}130 mg/dL as the reference, non-HDL-C 160 to 189 mg/dL, 190 to 219 mg/dL, and ≥220 mg/dL were significantly associated with CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.3 (95\\% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.8 (95\\% CI, 1.4-2.2), and 1.5 (95\\% CI, 1.2-2.0), respectively. Restricting the cohort to those with 10-year risk {$<$}5\\% did not diminish the associations of LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality. Conclusions: In a low 10-year risk cohort with long-term follow-up, LDL-C and non-HDL-C ≥160 mg/dL were independently associated with a 50\\% to 80\\% increased relative risk of CVD mortality.

However, a direct link between PTSD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been made. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an excellent method to detect atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association of PTSD to atherosclerotic CAD and mortality. Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 ± 9 years of age, 12.2\\% women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1\\% vs 59\\%, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p {$<$}0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1\\%, vs 57, 10.4\\%, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95\\% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score {$>$}0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95\\% CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores {$<$}400, p {$<$}0.05 for all comparisons).

This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95\\% CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95\\% CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95\\%CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95\\% CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression. Further, we found a higher risk of CVD among depressed individuals with symptoms of anxious distress.},\n  isbn = {1932-6203}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535966942,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":252},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1150,"entry":"@article{Amorim2015a,\n  title = {Modelling Recurrent Events: {{A}} Tutorial for Analysis in Epidemiology},\n  author = {Amorim, Leila D.A.F. and Cai, Jianwen},\n  date = {2015},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Epidemiology},\n  volume = {44},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {324--333},\n  issn = {14643685},\n  doi = {10.1093/ije/dyu222},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/44/1/324/654595},\n  urldate = {2019-12-21},\n  abstract = {In many biomedical studies, the event of interest can occur more than once in a participant.

The aim of this article is to review the clinical epidemiological features of AF and to relate them to underlying mechanisms. Long-established risk factors for AF include aging, male sex, hypertension, valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Emerging risk factors include prehypertension, increased pulse pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, high-level physical training, diastolic dysfunction, predisposing gene variants, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. Potential risk factors are coronary artery disease, kidney disease, systemic inflammation, pericardial fat, and tobacco use. AF has substantial population health consequences, including impaired quality of life, increased hospitalization rates, stroke occurrence, and increased medical costs. The pathophysiology of AF centers around 4 general types of disturbances that promote ectopic firing and reentrant mechanisms, and include the following: (1) ion channel dysfunction, (2) Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities, (3) structural remodeling, and (4) autonomic neural dysregulation. Aging, hypertension, valve disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and endurance exercise training all cause structural remodeling. Heart failure and prior atrial infarction also cause Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities that lead to focal ectopic firing via delayed afterdepolarizations/triggered activity. Neural dysregulation is central to atrial arrhythmogenesis associated with endurance exercise training and occlusive coronary artery disease. Monogenic causes of AF typically promote the arrhythmia via ion channel dysfunction, but the mechanisms of the more common polygenic risk factors are still poorly understood and under intense investigation. Better recognition of the clinical epidemiology of AF, as well as an improved appreciation of the underlying mechanisms, is needed to develop improved methods for AF prevention and management.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535966959,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":254},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2874,"entry":"@article{Andrade2023,\n  title = {Progression of {{Atrial Fibrillation}} after {{Cryoablation}} or {{Drug Therapy}}},\n  author = {Andrade, Jason G. and Deyell, Marc W. and Macle, Laurent and Wells, George A. and Bennett, Matthew and Essebag, Vidal and Champagne, Jean and Roux, Jean-Francois and Yung, Derek and Skanes, Allan and Khaykin, Yaariv and Morillo, Carlos and Jolly, Umjeet and Novak, Paul and Lockwood, Evan and Amit, Guy and Angaran, Paul and Sapp, John and Wardell, Stephan and Lauck, Sandra and Cadrin-Tourigny, Julia and Kochhäuser, Simon and Verma, Atul},\n  date = {2023-01-12},\n  journaltitle = {New England Journal of Medicine},\n  volume = {388},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {105--116},\n  publisher = {{Massachusetts Medical Society}},\n  issn = {0028-4793},\n  doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa2212540},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2212540},\n  urldate = {2023-06-11},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Users\\\\asshah4\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\924U3BUV\\\\Andrade et al. - 2023 - Progression of Atrial Fibrillation after Cryoablat.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535966981,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":255},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1406,"entry":"@article{Anttila2013,\n  title = {Genome-Wide Meta-Analysis Identifies New Susceptibility Loci for Migraine},\n  author = {Anttila, Verneri and Winsvold, Bendik S and Gormley, Padhraig and Kurth, Tobias and Bettella, Francesco and McMahon, George and Kallela, Mikko and Malik, Rainer and De Vries, Boukje and Terwindt, Gisela and Medland, Sarah E and Todt, Unda and McArdle, Wendy L and Quaye, Lydia and Koiranen, Markku and Ikram, Marfan and Lehtimäki, Terho and Stam, Anine H and Ligthart, Lannie and Wedenoja, Juho and Dunham, Ian and Neale, Benjamin M and Palta, Priit and Hamalainen, Eija and Schürks, Markus and Rose, Lynda M and Buring, Julie E and Ridker, Paul M and Steinberg, Stacy and Stefansson, Hreinn and Jakobsson, Finnbogi and Lawlor, Debbie A and Evans, David M and Ring, Susan M and Färkkilä, Markus and Artto, Ville and Kaunisto, Mari A and Freilinger, Tobias and Schoenen, Jean and Frants, Rune R and Pelzer, Nadine and Weller, Claudia M and Zielman, Ronald and Heath, Andrew C and Madden, Pamela A.F. and Montgomery, Grant W and Martin, Nicholas G and Borck, Guntram and Göbel, Hartmut and Heinze, Axel and Kuhn, Katja Heinze and Williams, Frances M.K. and Hartikainen, Anna Liisa and Pouta, Anneli and Van Den Ende, Joyce and Uitterlinden, Andre G and Hofman, Albert and Amin, Najaf and Hottenga, Jouke Jan and Vink, Jacqueline M and Heikkilä, Kauko and Alexander, Michael and Myhsok, Bertram Muller and Schreiber, Stefan and Meitinger, Thomas and Wichmann, Heinz Erich and Aromaa, Arpo and Eriksson, Johan G and Traynor, Bryan J and Trabzuni, Daniah and Rossin, Elizabeth and Lage, Kasper and Jacobs, Suzanne B.R. and Gibbs, J Raphael and Birney, Ewan and Kaprio, Jaakko and Penninx, Brenda W and Boomsma, Dorret I and Van Duijn, Cornelia and Raitakari, Olli and Jarvelin, Marjo Riitta and Zwart, John Anker and Cherkas, Lynn and Strachan, David P and Kubisch, Christian and Ferrari, Michel D and Van Den Maagdenberg, Arn Mjm J.M. and Dichgans, Martin and Wessman, Maija and Smith, George Davey and Stefansson, Kari and Daly, Mark J and Nyholt, Dale R and Chasman, Daniel I. and Palotie, Aarno},\n  date = {2013-08-23},\n  journaltitle = {Nature Genetics},\n  volume = {45},\n  number = {8},\n  eprint = {23793025},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {912--917},\n  issn = {10614036},\n  doi = {10.1038/ng.2676},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23793025},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {Migraine is the most common brain disorder, affecting approximately 14\\% of the adult population, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.

In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.},\n  keywords = {dorsal root ganglion afferent,intrinsic cardiac nervous system,local circuit neurone,myocardial ischemia,neurone,nodose ganglion afferent,parasympathetic efferent neurone,sympathetic efferent neurone},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3ZC5WU2X/1999 - Armour - Myocardial ischaemia and the cardiac nervous system.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967023,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":257},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":958,"entry":"@article{Arri2016,\n  title = {Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischaemia},\n  author = {Arri, S S and Ryan, M and Redwood, S R and Marber, M S},\n  date = {2016-03},\n  journaltitle = {Heart},\n  volume = {102},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {25727240},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {472--480},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  issn = {1355-6037},\n  doi = {10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307306},\n  url = {http://heart.bmj.com/},\n  urldate = {2018-12-17},\n  abstract = {Objective: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor.

A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50\\% were female and 60\\% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95\\% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17\\% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95\\% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12\\% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95\\% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},\n  isbn = {9783319324807},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VVUPBR2G/2016 - Arri et al. - Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967034,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":258},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":976,"entry":"@article{Arrighi2000,\n  title = {Myocardial Bloodflow Response during Mental Stress in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease},\n  author = {Arrighi, James A and Burg, Matthew and Cohen, Ira S and Kao, Alexander H and Pfau, Steven and Caulin-Glaser, Teresa and Zaret, Barry L and Soufer, Robert},\n  date = {2000-07-22},\n  journaltitle = {Lancet},\n  volume = {356},\n  number = {9226},\n  eprint = {11071190},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {310--311},\n  issn = {01406736},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02510-1},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071190},\n  urldate = {2018-12-01},\n  abstract = {Positron emission tomography was used to quantify changes in myocardial blood flow during mental stress in patients with and without coronary artery disease.

The increasing incidence of diabetes in young individuals is particularly worrisome given that the disease is likely to evolve over a period of years. In 1972, the existence of a diabetic cardiomyopathy was proposed based on the experience with four adult diabetic patients who suffered from congestive heart failure in the absence of discernible coronary artery disease, valvular or congenital heart disease, hypertension, or alcoholism. The exact mechanisms underlying the disease are unknown; however, an important component of the pathological alterations observed in these hearts includes the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in particular collagens. The excess deposition of ECM in the heart mirrors what occurs in other organs such as the kidney and peritoneum of diabetics. Mechanisms responsible for these alterations may include the excess production, reduced degradation, and/or chemical modification of ECM proteins. These effects may be the result of direct or indirect actions of high glucose concentrations. This article reviews our state of knowledge on the effects that diabetes-like conditions exert on the cells responsible for ECM production as well as relevant experimental and clinical data. © 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/HJK9EHWM/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967050,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":260},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1501,"entry":"@article{Austin2016,\n  title = {Introduction to the {{Analysis}} of {{Survival Data}} in the {{Presence}} of {{Competing Risks}}},\n  author = {Austin, Peter C. and Lee, Douglas S. and Fine, Jason P.},\n  date = {2016},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {133},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {26858290},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {601--609},\n  issn = {15244539},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017719},\n  abstract = {Competing risks occur frequently in the analysis of survival data. A competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. In a study examining time to death attributable to cardiovascular causes, death attributable to noncardiovascular causes is a competing risk. When estimating the crude incidence of outcomes, analysts should use the cumulative incidence function, rather than the complement of the Kaplan-Meier survival function. The use of the Kaplan-Meier survival function results in estimates of incidence that are biased upward, regardless of whether the competing events are independent of one another. When fitting regression models in the presence of competing risks, researchers can choose from 2 different families of models: modeling the effect of covariates on the cause-specific hazard of the outcome or modeling the effect of covariates on the cumulative incidence function. The former allows one to estimate the effect of the covariates on the rate of occurrence of the outcome in those subjects who are currently event free. The latter allows one to estimate the effect of covariates on the absolute risk of the outcome over time. The former family of models may be better suited for addressing etiologic questions, whereas the latter model may be better suited for estimating a patient's clinical prognosis. We illustrate the application of these methods by examining cause-specific mortality in patients hospitalized with heart failure.

To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·80 (SD 0·03) compared with 0·67 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·69 (0·04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·74 (0·03) compared with 0·60 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·64 (0·03) for SDNN (p{$<$}0·0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p{$<$}0·0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke produce immense health and economic burdens in the United States and globally. The Update also presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease [CHD], heart failure [HF], valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs).

From January to July 2017 alone, the 2017 Statistical Update was accessed {$>$}106 500 times. Each annual version of the Statistical Update undergoes revisions to include the newest nationally representative data, add additional relevant published scientific findings, remove older information, add new sections or chapters, and increase the number of ways to access and use the assembled information. This year-long process, which begins as soon as the previous Statistical Update is published, is performed by the AHA Statistics Committee faculty volunteers and staff and government agency partners. This year's edition includes new data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, new metrics to assess and monitor healthy diets, new information on stroke in young adults, an enhanced focus on underserved and minority populations, a substantively expanded focus on the global burden of CVD, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals.

In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},\n  isbn = {0009-7322 (Print)},\n  keywords = {acute mental,cells,increases in cardiovascular variables,like,lymphocytes,rapid and transient,stress is accompanied by,studies have shown that,w m f any},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Z5ESW4KD/1994 - Benschop et al. - Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on immunologic and cardiovascular changes induced by mental stress.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967093,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":265},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1009,"entry":"@article{Berkman2003,\n  title = {Effects of {{Treating Depression}} and {{Low Perceived Social Support}} on {{Clinical Events}} after {{Myocardial Infarction}}: {{The Enhancing Recovery}} in {{Coronary Heart Disease Patients}} ({{ENRICHD}}) {{Randomized Trial}}},\n  author = {Berkman, Lisa F. and Blumenthal, James and Burg, Matthew and Carney, Robert M. and Catellier, Diane and Cowan, Marie J. and Czajkowski, Susan M. and De Busk, Robert and Hosking, James and Jaffe, Allan and Kaufmann, Peter G. and Mitchell, Pamela and Norman, James and Powell, Lynda H. and Raczynski, James M. and Schneiderman, Neil and {Raczynski}},\n  date = {2003-06-18},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American Medical Association},\n  volume = {289},\n  number = {23},\n  pages = {3106--3116},\n  publisher = {{American Medical Association}},\n  issn = {00987484},\n  doi = {10.1001/jama.289.23.3106},\n  abstract = {Context: Depression and low perceived social support (LPSS) after myocardial infarction (MI) are associated with higher morbidity and mortality, but little is known about whether this excess risk can be reduced through treatment.

Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted from October 1996 to April 2001 in 2481 MI patients (1084 women, 1397 men) enrolled from 8 clinical centers. Major or minor depression was diagnosed by modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and severity by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); LPSS was determined by the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) Social Support Instrument (ESSI). Random allocation was to usual medical care or CBT-based psychosocial intervention. Intervention: Cognitive behavior therapy was initiated at a median of 17 days after the index MI for a median of 11 individual sessions throughout 6 months, plus group therapy when feasible, with SSRIs for patients scoring higher than 24 on the HRSD or having a less than 50\\% reduction in Beck Depression Inventory scores after 5 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Composite primary end point of death or recurrent MI; secondary outcomes included change in HRSD (for depression) or ESSI scores (for LPSS) at 6 months. Results: Improvement in psychosocial outcomes at 6 months favored treatment: mean (SD) change in HRSD score, -10.1 (7.8) in the depression and psychosocial intervention group vs -8.4 (7.7) in the depression and usual care group (P{$<$}.001); mean (SD) change in ESSI score, 5.1 (5.9) in the LPSS and psychosocial intervention group vs 3.4 (6.0) in the LPSS and usual care group (P{$<$}.001).

AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy.

Further research is necessary to verify and establish reasons for these racial differences.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967114,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":268},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1051,"entry":"@article{Boscarino2008,\n  title = {A Prospective Study of Ptsd and Early-Age Heart Disease Mortality among Vietnam Veterans: {{Implications}} for Surveillance and Prevention},\n  author = {Boscarino, Joseph A},\n  date = {2008-07},\n  journaltitle = {Psychosomatic Medicine},\n  volume = {70},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {18596248},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {668--676},\n  issn = {00333174},\n  doi = {10.1097/PSY.0b013e31817bccaf},\n  url = {https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-200807000-00007},\n  urldate = {2018-10-27},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively early-age heart disease (HD) among a national random sample of 4328 male Vietnam veterans, who did not have HD at baseline in 1985.

However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20\\% increase in mortality risk (all p {$<$} .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline.

Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7\\% = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only.

Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p {$<$}.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p {$<$}.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.},\n  isbn = {0000000000000},\n  keywords = {Cardiovascular disease,depressive disorders,done,PTSD,stress},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/UEUFN7KH/2018 - Bremner et al. - Brain Correlates of Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967141,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":272},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1405,"entry":"@article{Bressler2010,\n  title = {Genetic Variants Identified in a {{European}} Genome-Wide Association Study That Were Found to Predict Incident Coronary Heart Disease in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study},\n  author = {Bressler, Jan and Folsom, Aaron R. and Couper, David J. and Volcik, Kelly A. and Boerwinkle, Eric},\n  date = {2010-01-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Epidemiology},\n  volume = {171},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {19955471},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {14--23},\n  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},\n  issn = {00029262},\n  doi = {10.1093/aje/kwp377},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/aje/kwp377},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {In 2007, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) performed a genome-wide association study in 2,000 British coronary heart disease (CHD) cases and 3,000 controls after genotyping 469,557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Seven variants associated with CHD were initially identified, and 5 SNPs were later found in replication studies. In the current study, the authors aimed to determine whether the 12 SNPs reported by the WTCCC predicted incident CHD through 2004 in a biracial, prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) comprising 15,792 persons aged 45-64 years who had been selected by probability sampling from 4 different US communities in 1987-1989. Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age and gender were used to estimate CHD hazard rate ratios (HRRs) over a 17-year period (1,362 cases in whites and 397 cases in African Americans) under an additive genetic model. The results showed that 3 SNPs in whites (rs599839, rs1333049, and rs501120; HRRs were 1.10 (P = 0.044), 1.14 (P {$<$} 0.001), and 1.14 (P = 0.030), respectively) and 1 SNP in African Americans (rs7250581; HRR = 1.60, P = 0.05) were significantly associated with incident CHD.

Method: A national sample of adults (N = 949) aged 34-84 rated their relationships with spouse, family, and friends at 2 time points 10 years apart. At the second time point, participants completed a biological protocol in which indices of autonomic, hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal axis, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic function were obtained and used to create an AL summary score. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations among 3 aspects of social relationships-social support, social negativity, and frequency of social contact-and AL. Results: Higher levels of spouse negativity, family negativity, friend contact, and network level contact were each associated with higher AL, and higher levels of spouse support were associated with lower AL, independent of age, sociodemographic factors, and health covariates. Tests for age interactions suggested that friend support and network support were each associated with higher AL among older adults, but at younger ages there appeared to be no association between friend support and AL and a negative association between network support and AL. For network negativity, there was a marginal interaction such that network negativity was associated with higher AL among younger adults but there was no association among older adults. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that structural and functional aspects of the social environment are associated with AL, and extend previous work by demonstrating that these associations vary based on the type of relationship assessed and by age.},\n  keywords = {Aging,Allostatic load,Relationships,Social negativity,Social support},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/TSIPJCCQ/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967153,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":274},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2065,"entry":"@article{Bun2015,\n  title = {Atrial Flutter: More than Just One of a Kind},\n  author = {Bun, Sok-Sithikun and Latcu, Decebal Gabriel and Marchlinski, Francis and Saoudi, Nadir},\n  date = {2015-09-14},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {36},\n  number = {35},\n  pages = {2356--2363},\n  publisher = {{Eur Heart J}},\n  issn = {0195-668X},\n  doi = {10.1093/eurheartj/ehv118},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv118},\n  urldate = {2022-11-22},\n  abstract = {Since its first description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial flutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved.

GREM2 expression follows cardiac lineage differentiation independently of the differentiation method used, or the origin of the pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that GREM2 is linked to cardiogenesis. Addition of GREM2 protein strongly increases cardiomyocyte output compared to established procardiogenic differentiation methods. Our data show that inhibition of canonical BMP signaling by GREM2 is necessary to promote proliferation of CPCs. However, canonical BMP signaling inhibition alone is not sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation, which depends on subsequent JNK pathway activation specifically by GREM2.

The traditional tool of epidemiological ‘risk factor analysis’ is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model.},\n  isbn = {0300-5771 (Print)\\textbackslash r0300-5771},\n  keywords = {Data correlation,Regression models,Statistics,Twin studies},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/4DKXIVU8/2005_Carlin et al._Regression models for twin studies A critical review.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967202,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":281},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1731,"entry":"@article{Carnevali2018,\n  title = {Autonomic and Brain Morphological Predictors of Stress Resilience},\n  author = {Carnevali, Luca and Koenig, Julian and Sgoifo, Andrea and Ottaviani, Cristina},\n  date = {2018-04-06},\n  journaltitle = {Frontiers in Neuroscience},\n  volume = {12},\n  pages = {228},\n  publisher = {{Frontiers Media S.A.}},\n  issn = {1662453X},\n  doi = {10.3389/fnins.2018.00228},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC5897537/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-11-05},\n  abstract = {Stressful life events are an important cause of psychopathology. Humans exposed to aversive or stressful experiences show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in their responses. However, the majority does not develop stress-related psychiatric disorders. The dynamic processes encompassing positive and functional adaptation in the face of significant adversity have been broadly defined as resilience. Traditionally, the assessment of resilience has been confined to self-report measures, both within the general community and putative high-risk populations. Although this approach has value, it is highly susceptible to subjective bias and may not capture the dynamic nature of resilience, as underlying construct. Recognizing the obvious benefits of more objective measures of resilience, research in the field has just started investigating the predictive value of several potential biological markers. This review provides an overview of theoretical views and empirical evidence suggesting that individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of resting cardiac vagal outflow, may underlie different levels of resilience toward the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Following this line of thought, recent studies describing associations between regional brain morphometric characteristics and resting state vagally-mediated HRV are summarized. Existing studies suggest that the structural morphology of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), particularly its cortical thickness, is implicated in the expression of individual differences in HRV. These findings are discussed in light of emerging structural neuroimaging research, linking morphological characteristics of the ACC to psychological traits ascribed to a high-resilient profile and abnormal structural integrity of the ACC to the psychophysiological expression of stress-related mental health consequences. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach integrating brain structural imaging with HRV monitoring could offer novel perspectives about brain-body pathways in resilience and adaptation to psychological stress.},\n  issue = {APR},\n  keywords = {Anterior cingulate cortex,Cortical thickness,Depression,Heart rate variability,PTSD,Resilience,Stress},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/4LSVFX9P/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967207,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":282},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":752,"entry":"@report{Carney,\n  title = {Low Heart Rate Variability and the Effect of Depression on Post-Myocardial Infarction Mortality},\n  author = {Carney, Robert M. and Blumenthal, James A. and Freedland, Kenneth E. and Stein, Phyllis K. and Howells, William B. and Berkman, Lisa F. and Watkins, Lana L. and Czajkowski, Susan M. and Hayano, Junichiro and Domitrovich, Peter P. and Jaffe, Allan S.},\n  date = {2005},\n  journaltitle = {Archives of Internal Medicine},\n  volume = {165},\n  number = {13},\n  eprint = {16009863},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1486--1491},\n  issn = {00039926},\n  doi = {10.1001/archinte.165.13.1486},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. RESULTS: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{$<$}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1\\%) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{$<$}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95\\% CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95\\% CI, 0.23-0.31; P{$<$}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.},\n  isbn = {0003-9926 (Print)\\textbackslash r0003-9926},\n  keywords = {adult,aged,Ambulatory,article,Circadian Rhythm,clinical trial,comparative study,complications,confidence interval,controlled clinical trial,controlled study,death,depression,Depression,electrocardiography,Electrocardiography,epidemiology,female,Female,follow up,Follow-Up Studies,hazard assessment,heart infarction,Heart Rate,heart rate variability,human,Humans,ischemic heart disease,major clinical study,male,Male,Middle Aged,mortality,Myocardial Infarction,physiology,physiopathology,priority journal,Proportional Hazards Models,Retrospective Studies,risk assessment,risk factor,Risk Factors,Severity of Illness Index,survival,Survival Rate,United States}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967217,"version":0,"updated":1686537836839},"$loki":283},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":847,"entry":"@report{Carney1988,\n  title = {The Relationship between Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability and Depression in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease},\n  author = {Carney, Robert M. and Rich, Michael W. and TeVelde, Adriaantje and Saini, Jasbir and Clark, Karen and Freedland, Kenneth E.},\n  date = {1988},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Psychosomatic Research},\n  volume = {32},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {3404497},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {159--164},\n  issn = {00223999},\n  doi = {10.1016/0022-3999(88)90050-5},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=3404497},\n  abstract = {Seventy-seven patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization were administered a diagnostic psychiatric interview and their mean heart rates and heart rate variability were determined from the results of a 24 hr ambulatory ECG.

It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease.

Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95\\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95\\% CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients.

The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up.

Although standards antidepressants are more effective than placebo, up to 35\\% of patients do not respond to 4 or more conventional treatments and are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Considerable effort has been devoted to trying to find effective treatments for TRD. This review focuses on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), approved for TRD in 2005 by the Food and Drugs Administration. Stimulation is carried by bipolar electrodes on the left cervical vagus nerve, which are attached to an implanted stimulator generator. The vagus bundle contains about 80\\% of afferent fibers terminating in the medulla, from which there are projections to many areas of brain, including the limbic forebrain. Various types of brain imaging studies reveal widespread functional effects in brain after either acute or chronic VNS. Although more randomized control trials of VNS need to be carried out before a definitive conclusion can be reached about its efficacy, the results of open studies, carried out over period of 1 to 2 years, show much more efficacy when compared with results from treatment as usual studies. There is an increase in clinical response to VNS between 3 and 12 months, which is quite different from that seen with standard antidepressant treatment of MDD. Preclinically, VNS affects many of the same brain areas, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) and signal transduction mechanisms (brain-derived neurotrophic factor–tropomyosin receptor kinase B) as those found with traditional antidepressants. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which VNS benefits patients nonresponsive to conventional antidepressants is unclear, with further research needed to clarify this.},\n  keywords = {BDNF-TrkB,Monoamines,TRD,VNS}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967282,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":295},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":939,"entry":"@article{Carter2015,\n  title = {Sympathoneural and Adrenomedullary Responses to Mental Stress},\n  author = {Carter, Jason R and Goldstein, David S},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  journaltitle = {Comprehensive Physiology},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {25589266},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {119--146},\n  publisher = {{NIH Public Access}},\n  issn = {20404603},\n  doi = {10.1002/cphy.c140030},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589266},\n  urldate = {2019-08-23},\n  abstract = {This concept-based review provides historical perspectives and updates about sympathetic noradrenergic and sympathetic adrenergic responses to mental stress.

This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.},\n  keywords = {Acute mental stress,Heart Rate Variability,Systematic review with meta-analysis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3QG2AVAA/2015_Castaldo et al._Acute mental stress assessment via short term HRV analysis in healthy adults A systematic review with meta-analysis.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967290,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":297},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1945,"entry":"@online{CentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention2018,\n  title = {Underlying {{Cause}} of {{Death}}, 1999-2017 {{Results Form}}},\n  author = {{Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}},\n  date = {2018},\n  url = {https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76;jsessionid=BDCCDF1C86BC2DCE59ACB4091FF6#Citation},\n  urldate = {2022-06-09},\n  abstract = {Underlying Cause of Death 1999-2017 on CDC WONDER Online Database, released December, 2018.

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in candidate genes in ethnic minority probands with early-onset AF and determine genotype-phenotype associations. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort, family-based study, probands of African and Hispanic descent with early-onset AF (defined as AF occurring in individuals aged ≤66 years) prospectively enrolled in a clinical and genetic biorepository underwent sequencing of 60 candidate genes. Recruitment took place from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 1 to February 28, 2020. Exposures: Rare and novel variants categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in African American and Hispanic/Latinx probands with early-onset AF and genotype-phenotype associations. Results: Among 227 probands with early-onset AF, mean (SD) age at onset of AF was 51.0 (9.9) years, 132 probands (58.1\\%) were men, 148 (65.2\\%) were African American, and 79 (34.8\\%) were Hispanic/Latinx. A family history of AF was verified in 24 probands with early-onset AF (10.6\\%). Sequencing 60 candidate genes identified 53 (23 rare and 30 novel) variants with 16 of the 227 (7.0\\%) probands harboring likely pathogenic (43.8\\%) or pathogenic (56.2\\%) variants, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin (46.7\\%). In 6 families with more than 2 affected members, variants of unknown significance in sodium channel (SCN10A), potassium channel (KCNE5), sarcomeric proteins (MYH6 and TTN), and atrial natriuretic peptide (NPPA) cosegregated with AF. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants were identified, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, that increase susceptibility to early-onset AF in African American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals.

In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors.

Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms. OBJECTIVE To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease risk assessment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.},\n  keywords = {cardiovascular diseases,coronary calcium score,framingham risk calculator,risk assessment,united states preventive services task force},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/MNSEHIBL/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967336,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":305},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1765,"entry":"@article{DavidGoldberg1996,\n  title = {Ischemic, Hemodynamic, and Neurohormonal Responses to Mental and Exercise Stress: {{Experience}} from the {{Psychophysiological Investigations}} of {{Myocardial Ischemia}} Study ({{PIMI}})},\n  author = {David Goldberg, A. and Becker, Lewis C. and Bonsall, Robert and Cohen, Jerome D. and Ketterer, Mark W. and Kaufman, Peter G. and Krantz, David S. and Light, Kathleen C. and McMahon, Robert P. and Noreuil, Todd and Pepine, Carl J. and Raczynski, James and Stone, Peter H. and Dawn Strother, R.

Methods and Results: The Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study (PIMI) evaluated the physiological and neuroendocrine functioning in unmedicated patients with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ischemia. Hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to bicycle exercise, public speaking, and the Stroop test were measured by radionuclide ventriculography, ECG, and blood pressure and catecholamine monitoring. With mental stress, there were increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance that were correlated with increases in plasma epinephrine. During exercise, systemic vascular resistance fell, and there was no relationship between the hemodynamic changes and epinephrine levels. The fall in ejection fraction was greater with mental stress than exercise. During mental stress, the changes in election fraction were inversely correlated with the changes in systemic vascular resistance. Evidence for myocardial ischemia was present in 92\\% of patients during bicycle exercise and in 58\\% of patients during mental stress. Greater increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine occurred with ischemia during exercise, and greater increases in systemic vascular resistance occurred with ischemia during mental stress. Conclusions: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance and a relatively minor increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product compared with ischemia induced by exercise. These hemodynamic responses to mental stress can be mediated by the adrenal secretion of epinephrine. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved are important in the understanding of the etiology of myocardial ischemia and perhaps in the selection of appropriate anti-ischemic therapy.},\n  keywords = {catecholamines,exercise,hemodynamics,ischemia,mental,stress}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967347,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":306},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":748,"entry":"@article{Davydov2007,\n  title = {Baroreflex Mechanisms in Major Depression},\n  author = {Davydov, Dmitry M. and Shapiro, David and Cook, Ian A. and Goldstein, Iris},\n  date = {2007},\n  journaltitle = {Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry},\n  volume = {31},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {17011098},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {164--177},\n  issn = {02785846},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.08.015},\n  abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, in the following selective review, we attempt to reconcile sometimes-divergent evidence of the role of CAR in the pathway to depression. We first examine association of CAR with psychological factors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to develop depression. Then, we summarize the findings regarding the CAR profile in those with current depression, and evaluate evidence for the role of CAR following depression resolution and continued vulnerability. Finally, we showcase longitudinal studies showing the role of CAR in predicting depression onset and recurrence. Overall, the studies reveal an important, but complex, association between CAR and vulnerability to depression.},\n  keywords = {Daily hassles,Environmental factors,Genetic influence,HPA axis,MDD,SCN},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ZA3JC2FJ/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967358,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":308},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2195,"entry":"@article{Dekker1997,\n  title = {Heart {{Rate Variability}} from {{Short Electrocardiographic Recordings Predicts Mortality}} from {{All Causes}} in {{Middle-aged}} and {{Elderly Men}}: {{The Zutphen Study}}},\n  author = {Dekker, J.

However, up-to-date trends in disease burden and regional variation remain unknown. In an observational study utilizing the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, age-standardized mortality and incidence rates for AF overall and for each state in the United States (US) from 1990 to 2017 were determined. All analyses were stratified by gender. The relative change in age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized death rate (ASDR) over the observation period were determined. Trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression analysis. The mean ASIR per 100,000 population for men was 92 (+/-8) and for women was 62 (+/-5) in the US in 2017. The mean ASDR per 100,000 population for men was 5.8 (+/-0.3) and for women was 4.4 (+/-0.4). There were progressive increases in ASIR and ASDR in all but 1 state. The states with the greatest percentage change in incidence were New Hampshire (+13.5\\%) and Idaho (+16.0\\%) for men and women, respectively. The greatest change regarding mortality was seen in Mississippi (+26.3\\%) for men and Oregon (+53.8\\%) for women. In conclusion these findings provide updated evidence of increasing AF and/or AFL incidence and mortality on a national and regional level in the US, with women experiencing greater increases in incidence and mortality rates. This study demonstrates that the public health burden related to AF in the United States is progressively worsening but disproportionately across states and among women.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/JLVZ4K98/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967365,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":310},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1067,"entry":"@article{Denollet2010,\n  title = {Anger, {{Suppressed Anger}}, and {{Risk}} of {{Adverse Events}} in {{Patients With Coronary Artery Disease}}},\n  author = {Denollet, Johan and Gidron, Yori and Vrints, Christiaan J. and Conraads, Viviane M.},\n  date = {2010-06-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Cardiology},\n  volume = {105},\n  number = {11},\n  pages = {1555--1560},\n  issn = {00029149},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.01.015},\n  abstract = {Anger is associated with cardiovascular stress reactivity; however, little is known about the effect of suppressed anger in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We examined whether patients with CAD who suppress their anger are at risk of adverse events. At baseline, 644 patients with CAD completed measures of anger, anger-in (reluctance to express anger), and Type D personality (tendency to experience distress and to be inhibited). The combination of high anger and anger-in scores was used to identify the presence of suppressed anger. The end points were major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. After an average follow-up of 6.3 years (range 5 to 10), 126 patients (20\\%) had experienced a major adverse cardiac event, and 59 (9\\%) had experienced cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Anger (p = 0.009) and suppressed anger (p = 0.011) were associated with future major adverse cardiac events, but these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, suppressed anger remained associated with the more rigorous end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.87, 95\\% confidence interval 1.15 to 7.15, p = 0.024) after controlling for decreased systolic function, poor exercise tolerance, extent of CAD, and revascularization. Anger alone was not independently associated with this end point. Patients with a Type D personality had a fourfold rate of suppressed anger, and an adjustment for a Type D personality attenuated the observed association between suppressed anger and adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, patients with CAD who suppress their anger were at increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and this was accounted for by individual differences in Type D personality. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of exercise-associated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) during and after exercise testing. Methods: We studied 1847 heart failure-free patients who underwent clinical treadmill testing between March 13, 1997, and January 15, 2004, in the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the clinical and exercise test associations of exercise and recovery PVCs. Propensity score-adjusted Cox survival analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of exercise-associated PVCs. Results: Of the 1847 subjects, 850 (46.0\\%) developed exercise PVCs (median rate, 0.43 per minute) and 620 (33.6\\%) had recovery PVCs (median rate, 0.60 per minute). Resting PVCs, age, and systolic blood pressure were key predictors of both exercise and recovery PVCs. Whereas exercise PVCs were related to the heart rate increase with exercise, recovery PVCs were related to coronary disease (previous myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or pathological Q waves on resting electrocardiogram) and ST-segment depression. During a 5.4-year mean follow-up, 161 subjects (8.7\\%) died, and 53 of these deaths (32.9\\%) were due to cardiovascular causes.

For each core feature, we first provide a brief overview of its relevance to depression and neurobiological underpinnings, and then review evidence investigating a potential role of inflammation. We focus primarily on findings from experimental paradigms of exogenously-induced inflammation. We conclude that inflammation likely plays a role in exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward reactivity, and somatic symptoms.

Maternal and infant cortisol levels were sampled at baseline, reactivity, and recovery and mother's and infant's cardiac vagal tone were measured during the free play, still-face, and reunion episodes of the procedure. Cortisol reactivity was higher among infants in the SF condition and while cortisol decreased at recovery for infants in the SF+T, it further increased for those in the SF. Vagal tone showed a greater suppression when SF was not accompanied by maternal touch. Touch synchrony during free play was associated with higher infant vagal tone, whereas touch myssynchrony - maternal tactile stimulation while the infant gaze averts - correlated with higher maternal and infant cortisol.

There are few data concerning depression as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12\\%. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95\\% CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95\\% CI, 1.1-4.0). CONCLUSION: Clinical depression appears to be an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease for several decades after the onset of the clinical depression.},\n  isbn = {0003-9926},\n  keywords = {cardiovascular diseases,coronary heart disease risk,depressive disorders,endogenous depression},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/MTUU5L6G/1998 - Ford et al. - Depression is a risk factor for coronary artery disease in men The precursors study.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967401,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":318},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2077,"entry":"@article{Foy2018,\n  title = {Relation of {{Obesity}} to {{New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation}} and {{Atrial Flutter}} in {{Adults}}},\n  author = {Foy, Andrew J and Mandrola, John and Liu, Guodong and Naccarelli, Gerald V},\n  date = {2018},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Cardiology},\n  volume = {121},\n  number = {9},\n  eprint = {29501206},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1072--1075},\n  issn = {18791913},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019},\n  urldate = {2022-11-22},\n  abstract = {Prospective cohort studies involving older adults report an association of obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

The primary end point of new-onset atrial fibrillation was compared between obese and nonobese cohorts. We used logistic regression to determine the strength of association between obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes. Overall, 67,278 subjects were included in the cohort, divided evenly between those with and without a diagnosis of obesity. Obese subjects were significantly more likely to have hypertension (29.5\\% vs 14.6\\%) and diabetes (12.7\\% vs 5.2\\%) at study onset. Over 8 years of follow-up, we recorded a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in 1,511 (2.2\\%) subjects. Obesity was strongly associated with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation after controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes (odds ratio 1.4, 95\\% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.6). In conclusion, this information contributes to the growing evidence supporting the causal relation between obesity and atrial fibrillation, and emphasizes the need of addressing obesity as part of our therapeutic strategy to prevent atrial fibrillation.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/YMNQG3N3/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967405,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":319},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1084,"entry":"@article{Friedrich2017b,\n  title = {Depression {{Is}} the {{Leading Cause}} of {{Disability Around}} the {{World}}},\n  author = {Friedrich, M.

However, no published evidence exists that antidepressant drugs are safe or efficacious in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001. PATIENTS: A total of 369 patients with MDD (64\\% male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74\\%; unstable angina, 26\\%). INTERVENTION: After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD. RESULTS: Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54\\% [10\\%]; week 16, 54\\% [11\\%]; placebo: baseline, 52\\% [13\\%]; week 16, 53\\% [13\\%]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) runs (sertraline: 13.1\\%; placebo: 12.9\\%), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at end point (sertraline: 12\\%; placebo: 13\\%), or other cardiac measures. All comparisons were statistically nonsignificant (P{$>$} or = .05). The incidence of severe cardiovascular adverse events was 14.5\\% with sertraline and 22.4\\% with placebo.

Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.},\n  isbn = {0003-990X},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VL8DYBLL/2007 - Glassman et al. - Heart rate variability in acute coronary syndrome patients with major depression influence of sertraline and mo.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967440,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":326},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1763,"entry":"@article{Goldberg2002,\n  title = {The {{Vietnam}} Era Twin Registry},\n  author = {Goldberg, Jack and Curran, Birute and Vitek, Mary Ellen and Henderson, William G. and Boyko, Edward J.},\n  date = {2002-10-01},\n  journaltitle = {Twin Research},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {12537880},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {476--481},\n  publisher = {{Twin Res}},\n  issn = {13690523},\n  doi = {10.1375/136905202320906318},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12537880/},\n  urldate = {2021-03-07},\n  abstract = {The Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry is composed of 7369 middle-aged male-male twin pairs both of whom served in the military during the time of the Vietnam conflict (1965-1975), The Registry is a United States Department of Veterans Affairs resource that was originally constructed from military records; the Registry has been in existence for more than 15 years.

Patients underwent 1-hour Holter testing, with immediate HRV analysis using the HeartTrends DyDx algorithm, followed by exercise stress echocardiography (n=612) or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (n=431). The threshold for low HRV was identified using receiver operating characteristic analysis based on sensitivity and specificity. The primary end point was the presence of myocardial ischemia detected by exercise stress echocardiography or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The mean age of patients was 61 years and 38\\% were women. Myocardial ischemia was detected in 66 (6.3\\%) patients. After adjustment for CAD risk factors and exercise stress testing results, low HRV was independently associated with a significant 2-fold increased likelihood for myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.00; 95\\% CI, 1.41-2.89 [P=0.01]). Adding HRV to traditional CAD risk factors significantly improved the pretest probability for myocardial ischemia. Conclusions Our data from a large prospective international clinical study show that short-term HRV testing can be used as a novel digital-health modality for enhanced risk assessment in low- to intermediate-risk individuals without known CAD.

BACKGROUND: Although atrial flutter can now be cured, there are no reports on its epidemiology in unselected patients. METHODS: The Marshfield Epidemiological Study Area (MESA), a database that captures nearly all medical care among its 58,820 residents was used to ascertain all new cases of atrial flutter diagnosed from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1995. To identify predisposing risk factors, we employed an age- and gender-matched case-control study design using eight additional variables. RESULTS: A total of 181 new cases of atrial flutter were diagnosed for an overall incidence of 88/100,000 person-years. Incidence rates ranged from 5/100,000 in those {$<$}50 years old to 587/100,000 in subjects older than 80. Atrial flutter was 2.5 times more common in men (p {$<$} 0.001). The risk of developing atrial flutter increased 3.5 times (p {$<$} 0.001) in subjects with heart failure and 1.9 times (p {$<$} 0.001) for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among those with atrial flutter 16\\% were attributable to heart failure and 12\\% to chronic obstructive lung disease. Three subjects (1.7\\%) without identifiable predisposing risks were labeled as having 'lone atrial flutter.' CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first population-based investigation of atrial flutter, suggests this curable condition is much more common than previously appreciated. If our findings were applicable to the entire U.S. population, we estimate 200,000 new cases of atrial flutter in this country annually. At highest risk of developing atrial flutter are men, the elderly and individuals with preexisting heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions.

METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22\\% (±23\\%) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9\\% (-10.5\\%, -2.6\\%) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5\\% (8.1\\%, 91.3\\%), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1\\% [-10.9\\%, 8.2\\%], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.},\n  keywords = {Endothelial function,Epicardial,Flow,Mental stress,Microvascular,Resistance},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WS2IYSED/2018 - Hammadah et al. - Coronary and peripheral vasomotor responses to mental stress.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967516,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":338},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1007,"entry":"@article{Hare2014,\n  title = {Depression and Cardiovascular Disease: {{A}} Clinical Review},\n  author = {Hare, David L and Toukhsati, Samia R and Johansson, Peter and Jaarsma, Tiny},\n  date = {2014-06-01},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {35},\n  number = {21},\n  eprint = {24282187},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1365--1372},\n  issn = {15229645},\n  doi = {10.1093/eurheartj/eht462},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282187},\n  urldate = {2019-10-19},\n  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression are common. Patients with CVD have more depression than the general population. Persons with depression are more likely to eventually develop CVD and also have a higher mortality rate than the general population. Patients with CVD, who are also depressed, have a worse outcome than those patients who are not depressed. There is a graded relationship: the more severe the depression, the higher the subsequent risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events. It is possible that depression is only a marker for more severe CVD which so far cannot be detected using our currently available investigations. However, given the increased prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, a causal relationship with either CVD causing more depression or depression causing more CVD and a worse prognosis for CVD is probable. There are many possible pathogenetic mechanisms that have been described, which are plausible and that might well be important. However, whether or not there is a causal relationship, depression is the main driver of quality of life and requires prevention, detection, and management in its own right. Depression after an acute cardiac event is commonly an adjustment disorder than can improve spontaneously with comprehensive cardiac management. Additional management strategies for depressed cardiac patients include cardiac rehabilitation and exercise programmes, general support, cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressant medication, combined approaches, and probably disease management programmes. © The Author 2013.},\n  keywords = {Cardiovascular disease,Depression,Management,Prognosis,Quality of life,Screening}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967521,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":339},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2050,"entry":"@article{Heinze2001,\n  title = {A Solution to the Problem of Monotone Likelihood in {{Cox}} Regression},\n  author = {Heinze, Georg and Schemper, Michael},\n  date = {2001},\n  journaltitle = {Biometrics},\n  volume = {57},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {11252585},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {114--119},\n  issn = {0006341X},\n  doi = {10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00114.x},\n  abstract = {The phenomenon of monotone likelihood is observed in the fitting process of a Cox model if the likelihood converges to a finite value while at least once parameter estimate diverges to ±∞.

This procedure produces finite parameter estimates by means of penalized maximum likelihood estimation.

In particular, the membrane scaffolding protein BIN1 functions to initiate T-tubule genesis in skeletal muscle cells. Constitutive knockdown of BIN1 in mice is perinatal lethal, which is associated with an induced dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the functional role of BIN1 in cardiomyocytes is not known. An important function of cardiac T-tubules is to allow L-type calcium channels (Cav1.2) to be in close proximity to sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors to initiate the intracellular calcium transient. Efficient excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and normal cardiac contractility depend upon Cav1.2 localization to T-tubules. We hypothesized that BIN1 not only exists at cardiac T-tubules, but it also localizes Cav1.2 to these membrane structures. We report that BIN1 localizes to cardiac T-tubules and clusters there with Cav1.2. Studies involve freshly acquired human and mouse adult cardiomyocytes using complementary immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy with dual immunogold labeling, and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we use surface biotinylation and live cell confocal and total internal fluorescence microscopy imaging in cardiomyocytes and cell lines to explore delivery of Cav1.2 to BIN1 structures. We find visually and quantitatively that dynamic microtubules are tethered to membrane scaffolded by BIN1, allowing targeted delivery of Cav1.2 from the microtubules to the associated membrane. Since Cav1.2 delivery to BIN1 occurs in reductionist non-myocyte cell lines, we find that other myocyte-specific structures are not essential and there is an intrinsic relationship between microtubule-based Cav1.2 delivery and its BIN1 scaffold. In differentiated mouse cardiomyocytes, knockdown of BIN1 reduces surface Cav1.2 and delays development of the calcium transient, indicating that Cav1.2 targeting to BIN1 is functionally important to cardiac calcium signaling. We have identified that membrane-associated BIN1 not only induces membrane curvature but can direct specific antegrade delivery of microtubule-transported membrane proteins. Furthermore, this paradigm provides a microtubule and BIN1-dependent mechanism of Cav1.2 delivery to T-tubules. This novel Cav1.2 trafficking pathway should serve as an important regulatory aspect of EC coupling, affecting cardiac contractility in mammalian hearts.},\n  isbn = {10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/D93USNMU/2010 - Hong et al. - BIN1 localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967535,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":342},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1734,"entry":"@article{Hopp2013,\n  title = {High Cardiac Vagal Control Protects against Future Depressive Symptoms under Conditions of High Social Support},\n  author = {Hopp, Henrik and Shallcross, Amanda J. and Ford, Brett Q. and Troy, Allison S. and Wilhelm, Frank H. and Mauss, Iris B.},\n  date = {2013-04},\n  journaltitle = {Biological Psychology},\n  volume = {93},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {23352570},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {143--149},\n  publisher = {{NIH Public Access}},\n  issn = {03010511},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.01.004},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC3622765/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-11-05},\n  abstract = {High cardiac vagal control (as measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) is associated with lower depression. Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association. This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA. To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults. Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms. Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms. Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support. The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement. These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes.

The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established. T-wave amplitude and QT-interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were obtained from an ECG measured in a type II axis configuration. Results: Compared to controls, persons with depression or anxiety disorders did not show a significantly different TWA (p = 0.58; Cohen's d = 0.046) or QTc (p = 0.48; Cohen's d = -0.057). In spite of known sympathomimetic effects, TCA use (p = 0.26; Cohen's d = -0.162) and SNRI use (p = 0.70; Cohen's d = -0.055) were not significantly associated with a lower TWA.

Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized β coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95\\%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models (β coefficients ranging from −0.14 to −0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with β coefficients ranging from 0.05 to −0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.},\n  keywords = {depressive disorders,dysautonomia,heart rate variability,twins,veterans},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/KEU6WK7Y/2018 - Huang et al. - Association of Depressive Symptoms and Heart Rate Variability in Vietnam War–Era Twins(2).pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967559,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":345},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":756,"entry":"@article{Hughes2008,\n  title = {Depressive Symptoms Predict Heart Rate Recovery after Exercise Treadmill Testing in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease: {{Results}} from the Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study},\n  author = {Hughes, Joel W. and York, Kaki M. and Li, Qin and Freedland, Kenneth E. and Carney, Robert M. and Sheps, David S.},\n  date = {2008},\n  journaltitle = {Psychosomatic Medicine},\n  volume = {70},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {18434491},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {456--460},\n  issn = {15347796},\n  doi = {10.1097/PSY.0b013e31816fcab3},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function.

METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50\\% blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5\\% of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p {$<$} .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery.

Lower HRV parameter values were significant predictors of higher mortality across different ages, sex, continents, populations and recording lengths.

As such, standardized screening pathways for depression in patients with CVD offer the potential for early identification and optimal management of depression to improve health outcomes.

The clinical outcomes associated with heart failure are considerably worse for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes mellitus. In people with diabetes mellitus, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, has led to the descriptive terminology, diabetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy is increasing in parallel with the increase in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is initially characterized by myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and associated diastolic dysfunction, later by systolic dysfunction, and eventually by clinical heart failure. Impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevations in advanced glycation end products and collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities have all been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Molecular mechanisms linked to the underlying pathophysiological changes include abnormalities in AMP-Activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-Activated receptors, O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine, protein kinase C, microRNA, and exosome pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a contemporary view of these instigators of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as mechanistically based strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.},\n  keywords = {Cardiac,Diabetes mellitus,Heart failure,Myocytes,Proxisome proliferator-Activated receptors,Renin-Angiotensin system},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Y9FHGHUP/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967592,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":351},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":713,"entry":"@article{Jørgensen2015,\n  title = {Heart Rate Variability Density Analysis ({{Dyx}}) for Identification of Appropriate Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Recipients among Elderly Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction},\n  author = {Jørgensen, Rikke Mørch and Levitan, Jacob and Halevi, Zohar and Puzanov, Natalia and Abildstrøm, Steen Zabell and Messier, Marc D. and Huikuri, Heikki V. and Haarbo, Jens and Thomsen, Poul Erik Bloch and Jons, Christian},\n  date = {2015},\n  journaltitle = {Europace},\n  volume = {17},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {25755288},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1848--1854},\n  issn = {15322092},\n  doi = {10.1093/europace/euu394},\n  abstract = {AIMS: Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) density analysis specifically designed to identify patients at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction ≤40\\% after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24\\%) had a Dyx ≤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age {$>$}70 years and QRS {$>$} 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

Bayesian multivariate analysis revealed a greater relevance of galanin system genes in highly stressed subjects compared with subjects with moderate or low life stress. Using the same method, the effect of the galanin system genes was stronger than the effect of the well-studied 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). Conventional multivariate analysis using general linear models demonstrated that interaction of galanin system genes with life stressors explained more variance (1.7\\%, P = 0.005) than the life stress-only model. This effect replicated in independent analysis of the Manchester and Budapest subpopulations, and in males and females. The results suggest that the galanin pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in humans by increasing the vulnerability to early and recent psychosocial stress. Correcting abnormal galanin function in depression could prove to be a novel target for drug development.

Comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic data were collected and patients were followed annually, carefully documenting clinical outcomes, recurrence of paroxysmal AF, and progression to CAF. Baseline clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic variables were evaluated by univariate Cox proportionate hazards analysis. A stepwise approach was used to model the association between echocardiographic and clinical variables with progression to CAF. Results A total of 757 patients with a baseline diagnosis of paroxysmal AF were evaluated. Median follow-up was 8.0 years (range 2 days to 11.1 years). The probability of progression to CAF by 1 year was 8.6\\% and thereafter there was a slow but steady progression to 24.7\\% by 5 years. By 5 years, the probability of documented recurrence of any AF (chronic or paroxysmal) was 63.2\\%. Increasing age, significant aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, and diagnosis of cardiomyopathy were independently associated with progression to CAF. A more rapid heart rate during AF was associated with decreased risk of progression. Conclusions After the initial diagnosis of paroxysmal AF, there is a slow but steady progression to CAF.

Methods We estimated HR (bpm), standard deviation of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (SDNN, ms), and root mean squared difference in successive, normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (RMSSD, ms) from resting, standard 12-lead ECGs. We estimated associations between each phenotype and 17 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accounting for relatedness and adjusting for age, sex, study site, and ancestry. Cohort-specific estimates were combined using fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analysis. We investigated replication for select SNPs exceeding genome-wide (P {$<$}5 × 10–8) or suggestive (P {$<$}10–6) significance thresholds.

However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 ± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3\\%]), 100\\% completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9\\%) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6\\%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95\\% CI, 0.49-0.96;P = .03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8\\% vs 24.5\\% (HR, 0.82; 95\\% CI, 0.51-1.33;P = .43), for cardiac death, 10.7\\% vs 13.2\\% (HR, 0.79; 95\\% CI, 0.41-1.52;P = .48); for MI, 8.7\\% vs 15.2\\% (HR, 0.54; 95\\% CI, 0.27-0.96;P = .04), and for PCI, 12.8\\% vs 19.9\\% (HR, 0.58; 95\\% CI, 0.33-1.04;P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.

During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Methods Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether excessive digital vasoconstriction during acute mental stress predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred forty-nine patients with stable coronary artery disease (age 63±9, 76\\% male, 29\\% black) underwent mental stress testing with a standardized public speaking stressor and followed prospectively for cardiovascular end points. Digital pulse wave amplitude was continuously measured using peripheral artery tonometry (PAT, Itamar Inc). Stress/rest PAT ratio (sPAT) of pulse wave amplitude during mental stress/baseline was calculated and dichotomized by the median value into low and high sPAT ratio groups. Upon 3-year follow-up, Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard ratios were used to examine the association between sPAT ratio and the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and hospitalization for heart failure. The median sPAT ratio was 0.68 (interquartile range, 0.48-0.88), indicating 32\\% vasoconstriction with mental stress. Men were more likely to have low sPAT ratio than women (odds ratio, 1.79; P=0.007) while those on β-blockers were less likely to have low sPAT ratio (odds ratio, 0.52; P=0.003). After adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and rate-pressure product change during mental stress, those with low sPAT ratio were at significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.77 [95\\% CI, 1.12-2.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Greater peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, denoted by a low sPAT ratio, is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.},\n  keywords = {coronary artery disease,myocardial infarction,stress,vasoconstriction},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/EWX8U3MP/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967838,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":361},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2196,"entry":"@article{Kiviniemi2007,\n  title = {Endurance Training Guided Individually by Daily Heart Rate Variability Measurements},\n  author = {Kiviniemi, Antti M. and Hautala, Arto J. and Kinnunen, Hannu and Tulppo, Mikko P.},\n  date = {2007-10-10},\n  journaltitle = {European Journal of Applied Physiology},\n  volume = {101},\n  number = {6},\n  pages = {743--751},\n  issn = {1439-6319},\n  doi = {10.1007/s00421-007-0552-2}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967841,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":362},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1019,"entry":"@article{Ko2017,\n  title = {Cohort Profile: {{The Emory Cardiovascular Biobank}} ({{EmCAB}})},\n  author = {Ko, Yi An and Hayek, Salim and Sandesara, Pratik and Samman Tahhan, Ayman and Quyyumi, Arshed},\n  date = {2017},\n  journaltitle = {BMJ Open},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {29288185},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {e018753},\n  publisher = {{BMJ Publishing Group}},\n  issn = {20446055},\n  doi = {10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018753},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29288185},\n  urldate = {2019-02-03},\n  abstract = {A series of calcineurin-inhibiting compds. consisting of a central arom.

The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002–2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 ± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as “Psychological distress”; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results “Psychological distress” was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95\\% CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, “Psychological distress” mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: −7.1, 95\\% CI: −9.7, −4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.},\n  isbn = {2047-4873},\n  keywords = {Anxiety,Cardiovascular disease,CVD risk factors,Depression,Mediation,Psychological distress}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967858,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":364},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2054,"entry":"@article{Kornej2020,\n  title = {Epidemiology of {{Atrial Fibrillation}} in the 21st {{Century}}: {{Novel Methods}} and {{New Insights}}.},\n  author = {Kornej, Jelena and Börschel, Christin S and Benjamin, Emelia J and Schnabel, Renate B},\n  date = {2020-06-19},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation research},\n  volume = {127},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {32716709},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {4--20},\n  publisher = {{Lippincott Williams and Wilkins}},\n  issn = {1524-4571},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316340},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716709},\n  abstract = {Accompanying the aging of populations worldwide, and increased survival with chronic diseases, the incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) are rising, justifying the term global epidemic.

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as \"0\" (not at all) to \"3\" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$>$} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88\\% and a specificity of 88\\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967880,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":367},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1037,"entry":"@article{Kronish2019,\n  title = {Effect of {{Depression Screening}} after {{Acute Coronary Syndromes}} on {{Quality}} of {{Life}}: {{The CODIACS-QoL Randomized Clinical Trial}}},\n  author = {Kronish, Ian M. and Moise, Nathalie and Cheung, Ying Kuen and Clarke, Gregory N. and Dolor, Rowena J. and Duer-Hefele, Joan and Margolis, Karen L. and St Onge, Tara and Parsons, Faith and Retuerto, Jessica and Thanataveerat, Anusorn and Davidson, Karina W.},\n  date = {2019},\n  journaltitle = {JAMA Internal Medicine},\n  publisher = {{American Medical Association}},\n  issn = {21686106},\n  doi = {10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.4518},\n  abstract = {Importance: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated depressive symptoms are at increased risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality, worse quality of life, and higher health care costs. These observational findings prompted multiple scientific panels to advise universal depression screening in survivors of ACS prior to evidence from randomized screening trials. Objective: To determine whether systematically screening for depression in survivors of ACS improves quality of life and depression compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-group multisite randomized trial enrolled 1500 patients with ACS from 4 health care systems between November 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, with follow-up ending July 31, 2018. Patients were eligible if they had been hospitalized for ACS in the previous 2 to 12 months and had no prior history of depression. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: Patients with ACS were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive (1) systematic depression screening using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with notification of primary care clinicians and provision of centralized, patient-preference, stepped depression care for those with positive screening results (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10; screen, notify, and treat, n = 499); (2) systematic depression screening, with notification of primary care clinicians for those with positive screening results (screen and notify, n = 501); and (3) usual care (no screening, n = 500). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in quality-adjusted life-years. The secondary outcome was depression-free days. Adverse effects and mortality were assessed by patient interview and hospital records. Results: A total of 1500 patients (424 women and 1076 men; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [11.5] years) were randomized in the 18-month trial. Only 71 of 1000 eligible survivors of ACS (7.1\\%) had elevated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores indicating depressive symptoms at screening. There were no differences in mean (SD) change in quality-adjusted life-years (screen, notify and treat, -0.06 [0.20]; screen and notify, -0.06 [0.20]; no screen, -0.06 [0.18]; P =.98) or cumulative mean (SD) depression-free days (screen, notify and treat, 343.1 [179.0] days; screen and notify, 351.3 [175.0] days; no screen, 339.0 [176.6] days; P =.63). Harms including death, bleeding, or sleep difficulties did not differ among groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with ACS without a history of depression, systematic depression screening with or without providing depression treatment did not alter quality-adjusted life-years, depression-free days, or harms.

HRV (5-minute resting baseline vs. 5-minute meditation) was collected from 36 participants before and after they completed a 10-day intensive Vipassana retreat. Changes in three frequency-domain measures of HRV were analysed using 2 (Time; pre- vs. post-Vipassana). ×. 2 (Task; resting baseline vs. meditation) within subjects ANOVA. These measures were: normalised high-frequency power (HF n.u.), a widely used biomarker of parasympathetic activity; log-transformed high frequency power (ln HF), a measure of RSA and required to interpret normalised HF; and Traube-Hering-Mayer waves (THM), a component of the low frequency spectrum linked to baroreflex outflow. As expected, participants showed significantly increased well-being, and decreased ill-being. ln HF increased overall during meditation compared to resting baseline, while there was a time. *. task interaction for THM. Further testing revealed that pre-Vipassana only ln HF increased during meditation (vs. resting baseline), consistent with a change in respiration. Post-Vipassana, the meditation task increased HF n.u. and decreased THM compared to resting baseline, suggesting post-Vipassana task-related changes are characterised by a decrease in absolute LF power, not parasympathetic-mediated increases in HF power. Such baroreflex changes are classically associated with attentional load, and our results are interpreted in light of the concept of 'flow' - a state of positive and full immersion in an activity. These results are also consistent with changes in normalised HRV reported in other meditation studies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},\n  keywords = {Heart rate variability,Meditation,Mindfulness,Respiratory sinus arrhythmia,Traube-Hering-Mayer waves,Vipassana,Well-being},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GUBZU8H2/1-s2.0-S0167876013001888-main.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967895,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":369},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1985,"entry":"@article{Kupper2015,\n  title = {Cardiovascular Reactivity to Mental Stress and Mortality in Patients with Heart Failure},\n  author = {Kupper, Nina and Denollet, Johan and Widdershoven, Jos and Kop, Willem J.},\n  date = {2015-05-01},\n  journaltitle = {JACC: Heart Failure},\n  volume = {3},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {25951757},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {373--382},\n  publisher = {{American College of Cardiology FoundationWashington, D.C.}},\n  issn = {22131779},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016},\n  url = {https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016},\n  urldate = {2022-07-27},\n  abstract = {Objectives: This study examined whether blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to acute mental stress were associated with mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Background: HF is characterized by reduced contractility and impaired BP reactivity. Compared to exercise-induced physiological changes, the effects of mental stress on BP and heart rate in HF are not well understood. Methods: Patients with systolic HF (N= 100, 26\\% female, mean 65 ± 12 years of age) underwent a structured public speech task, during which BP and heart rate were recorded. Stress-induced BP and heart rate reactivity were categorized as high ({$>$}75\\%), intermediate (25\\% to 75\\%), or low ({$<$}25\\%). Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to examine the predictive value of cardiovascular stress responses for mortality (median follow-up= 48.5 months), adjusting for age, implanted devices, and baseline BP and heart rate levels. Results: At follow-up, 31 patients had died (31\\%). Mortality rates were 2 times higher (hazard ratio [HR]:2.04; 95\\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 3.60; p= 0.014) among patients with the lowest diastolic BP responses (mean=-2.4 ± 5.4mmHg) to mental stress than among those patients with an intermediate diastolic BP response (mean= 7.3 ± 2.5mmHg), adjusting for covariates. High diastolic BP reactivity (mean= 16.3 ± 3.4 mmHg) was not related to mortality (HR: 0.95; 95\\% CI: 0.55 to 1.66). Systolic BP responses showed a similar but nonsignificant association. Multivariate analyses showed that a high heart rate response ({$>$}6.3 beats/min) to acute mental stress was associated with a reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.40; 95\\% CI: 0.16 to 1.00; p= 0.051) compared to patients with intermediate responses. Conclusions: Low diastolic BP reactivity to mental stress is independently associated with all-cause mortality inpatients with HF.

Design A population-based, health and nutrition prospective survey. Methods In the context of the ATTICA Study (2002-2012), 853 adult participants without previous CVD history (453 men (45+/-13 years) and 400 women (44+/-18 years)) underwent psychological evaluations through validated, self-reporting depression and anxiety questionnaires. Results After adjustment for multiple established CVD risk factors, both reported depression and anxiety levels were positively and independently associated with the 10-year CVD incidence, with depression markedly increasing the CVD risk by approximately fourfold (adjusted odds ratio (95\\% confidence interval) 3.6 (1.3, 11) for depression status; 1.03 (1.0, 1.1) for anxiety levels).

Background: Anger can precipitate spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and induce TWA. Whether anger-induced TWA predicts future arrhythmias is unknown. Methods: Sixty-two patients with ICDs underwent ambulatory electrocardiography during a mental stress protocol, 3 months after the ICD was implanted. T-wave alternans was analyzed using time-domain methods. After a ≥1 year follow-up, ICD stored data was reviewed to determine incidence of ICD-terminated ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. Results: Patients with ICD-terminated arrhythmias during follow-up (n = 10) had higher TWA induced by anger, 13.2 μV (interquartile range [IQR] 9.3 to 16 μV), compared with those patients without future ventricular arrhythmias, 9.3 μV (IQR 7.5 to 11.5 μV, p {$<$} 0.01). Patients in the highest quartile of anger-induced TWA ({$>$}11.9 μV, n = 15) were more likely to experience arrhythmias by 1 year than those in the lower quartiles (33\\% vs. 4\\%) and during extended follow-up (40\\% vs. 9\\%, p {$<$} 0.01 for both). In multivariable regression controlling for ejection fraction, prior clinical arrhythmia, and wide QRS, anger-induced TWA remained a significant predictor of arrhythmia, with likelihood in the top quartile 10.8 times that of other patients (95\\% confidence interval: 1.6 to 113, p {$<$} 0.05).

Methods and Results - A multivariate survival model for the identification of sudden (presumably arrhythmic) death was developed with data from 202 consecutive patients referred between 1991 and 1995 with moderate to severe CHF (age 52±9 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 24±7\\%, New York Heart Association class 2.3±0.7; the derivation sample). Time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters obtained from an 8′ recording of ECG at baseline and during controlled breathing (12 to 15 breaths/min) were challenged against clinical and functional parameters. This model was then validated in 242 consecutive patients referred between 1996 and 2001 (validation sample). In the derivation sample, sudden death was independently predicted by a model that included low-frequency power (LFP) of HRV during controlled breathing ≤13 ms2 and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ≥77 mm (relative risk [RR] 3.7, 95\\% CI 1.5 to 9.3, and RR 2.6, 95\\% CI 1.0 to 6.3, respectively). The derivation model was also a significant predictor in the validation sample (P=0.04). In the validation sample, LFP ≤11 ms2 during controlled breathing and ≥83 ventricular premature contractions per hour on Holter monitoring were both independent predictors of sudden death (RR 3.0, 95\\% CI 1.2 to 7.6, and RR 3.7, 95\\% CI 1.5 to 9.0, respectively). Conclusions - Reduced short-term LFP during controlled breathing is a powerful predictor of sudden death in patients with CHF that is independent of many other variables.

We examined the association between HRV and incident CHD and non-CHD mortality in a cohort of 11,654 men and women aged 45–64 years at intake, from the biracial, population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Supine, resting, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected at the baseline examination. High frequency (HF; 0.15–0.40 Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) spectral powers, LF/HF ratio, normalized HF and LF, the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN), and the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (MSSD) were used as the conventional indexes of HRV to measure cardiac autonomic control. From this cohort, 635 cases of incident CHD (including 346 cases of incident myocardial infarction [MI] and 82 cases of fatal CHD), and 623 non-CHD deaths were identified and validated after an average of 8 years of follow-up. Among individuals with diabetes, the multivariable adjusted proportional hazards ratios (95\\% CI) were 2.03 (1.28–3.23), 1.60 (1.12–2.27), 1.50 (0.65–3.42), and 1.27 (0.84–1.91) for incident MI, incident CHD, fatal CHD, and non-CHD deaths, respectively, comparing the lowest quartile to the upper most three quartiles of HF. A similar pattern of associations was found for LF, SDNN, and MSSD. By contrast, there was no consistent pattern of associations among individuals without diabetes. At the population level, a lower HRV (reflective of impaired cardiac autonomic control) is statistically significantly related to the development of CHD among individuals with diabetes, independent of markers of the duration/severity of the glucose metabolism impairment.

The purpose of this scientific statement is to review available evidence and recommend whether depression should be elevated to the status of a risk factor for patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS - : Writing group members were approved by the American Heart Association's Scientific Statement and Manuscript Oversight Committees. A systematic literature review on depression and adverse medical outcomes after acute coronary syndrome was conducted that included all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and composite outcomes for mortality and nonfatal events. The review assessed the strength, consistency, independence, and generalizability of the published studies. A total of 53 individual studies (32 reported on associations with all-cause mortality, 12 on cardiac mortality, and 22 on composite outcomes) and 4 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of the demographic composition of study samples, definition and measurement of depression, length of follow-up, and covariates included in the multivariable models. Despite limitations in some individual studies, our review identified generally consistent associations between depression and adverse outcomes.

Objective To determine the association between mental stress-induced impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation as assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation and adverse cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital network between June 2011 and August 2014. A cohort of individuals with stable coronary artery disease were included. Data analysis took place from November 2018 to May 2019. Exposures Study participants were subjected to a laboratory mental stress task (public speaking). Main Outcomes and Measures Flow-mediated vasodilation was measured before and 30 minutes after a public-speaking mental stress task. We examined the association of the rest (prestress), poststress, and δ flow-mediated vasodilation (poststress minus prestress levels) with an adjudicated composite end point of adverse events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina leading to revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, medical history, and depression. Results A total of 569 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [9.3] years; 420 men [73.8\\%]). Flow-mediated vasodilation decreased from a mean (SD) of 4.8\\% (3.7\\%) before mental stress to 3.9\\% (3.6\\%) after mental stress (a 23\\% reduction; P {$<$} .001), and 360 participants (63.3\\%) developed transient endothelial dysfunction (a decrease in flow-mediated vasodilation). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 3.0 (2.9-3.1) years, 74 patients experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event. The presence of transient endothelial dysfunction with mental stress was associated with a 78\\% increase (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.78 [95\\% CI, 1.15-2.76]) in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular event. Both the δ flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.15 [95\\% CI, 1.03-1.27] for each 1\\% decline) and poststress flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.14 [95\\% CI, 1.04-1.24] for each 1\\% decline) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular event.

Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967971,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":382},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1054,"entry":"@article{Magruder2016,\n  title = {Long-{{Term Trajectories}} of {{PTSD}} in {{Vietnam-Era Veterans}}: {{The Course}} and {{Consequences}} of {{PTSD}} in {{Twins}}},\n  author = {Magruder, Kathryn M. and Goldberg, Jack and Forsberg, Christopher W. and Friedman, Matthew J. and Litz, Brett T. and Vaccarino, Viola and Heagerty, Patrick J. and Gleason, Theresa C. and Huang, Grant D. and Smith, Nicholas L.},\n  date = {2016-02},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Traumatic Stress},\n  volume = {29},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {20419729},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {5--16},\n  issn = {15736598},\n  doi = {10.1002/jts.22075},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26764215},\n  urldate = {2018-11-25},\n  abstract = {What do we know about resilience in crime victimization?

Results: AF and AFL patients were significantly more likely to be daily alcohol drinkers (27\\% vs 14\\% of controls, P = 0.001).

Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient β-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and β-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p {$<$} 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p {$<$} 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p {$<$} 0.01).

It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure contributes to the risk for development of PTSD. OBJECTIVE To examine whether HRV before combat deployment is associated with increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment when accounting for deployment-related combat exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between July 14, 2008, and May 24, 2012, active-duty Marines were assessed 1 to 2 months before a combat deployment and again 4 to 6 months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Participants in the second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to April 16, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predeployment HRVwas measured via finger photoplethysmography during a 5-minute period of rest. Frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. Diagnosis of PTSD was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. RESULTS After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, lower HRV before deployment as measured by an increased low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) ratio of HRV was associated with risk of PTSD diagnosis after deployment (combined MRS-I and MRS-II cohortmeta-analysis odds ratio, 1.47; 95\\%CI, 1.10-1.98; P = .01).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This prospective longitudinal study provides initial and modest evidence that an altered state of autonomic nervous system functioning contributes to PTSD vulnerability, taking into account other key risk factors. If these findings are replicated, interventions that change autonomic nervous system function may open novel opportunities for prevention and treatment of PTSD.},\n  keywords = {2003-2011,Adam X Maihofer,Adult,Afghan Campaign 2001-,Arpi Minassian,Cohort Studies,doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0922,Extramural,Heart Rate / physiology*,Humans,Iraq War,Logistic Models,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Marine Resiliency Study Team,MEDLINE,Military Personnel / psychology*,Multivariate Analysis,N.I.H.,National Center for Biotechnology Information,National Institutes of Health,National Library of Medicine,NCBI,NIH,NLM,Non-P.H.S.,Photoplethysmography,pmid:26353072,Post-Traumatic / epidemiology*,Prevalence,Prospective Studies,PubMed Abstract,Research Support,Risk,Stress Disorders,U.S. Gov't,Young Adult},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/39W958F8/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968031,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":389},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1059,"entry":"@article{Mittleman1995,\n  title = {Triggering of Acute Myocardial Infarction Onset by Episodes of Anger},\n  author = {Mittleman, Murray A and Maclure, Malcolm and Sherwood, Jane B and Mulry, Richard P and Tofler, Geoffrey H and Jacobs, Sue C and Friedman, Richard and Benson, Herbert and Muller, James E},\n  date = {1995-10-01},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {92},\n  number = {7},\n  eprint = {7671353},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1720--1725},\n  publisher = {{American Heart Association, Inc.}},\n  issn = {00097322},\n  doi = {10.1161/01.CIR.92.7.1720},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7671353},\n  urldate = {2018-05-31},\n  abstract = {Background Many anecdotes and several uncontrolled case series have suggested that emotionally stressful events, and more specifically, anger, immediately precede and appear to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction. However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95\\% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95\\% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95\\% confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P{$<$}.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.},\n  isbn = {0009-7322 (Print)\\textbackslash r0009-7322 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {anger,myocardial infarction}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968041,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":390},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1955,"entry":"@article{Moazzami2020,\n  title = {Higher {{Activation}} of the {{Rostromedial Prefrontal Cortex}} during {{Mental Stress Predicts Major Cardiovascular Disease Events}} in {{Individuals}} with {{Coronary Artery Disease}}},\n  author = {Moazzami, Kasra and Wittbrodt, Matthew T. and Lima, Bruno B. and Nye, Jonathon A. and Mehta, Puja K. and Pearce, Brad D. and Almuwaqqat, Zakaria and Hammadah, Muhammad and Levantsevych, Oleksiy and Sun, Yan V. and Raggi, Paolo and Garcia, Ernest V. and Goetz, Margarethe and Quyyumi, Arshed A. and Bremner, J.

Certain brain regions that control both emotional states and cardiac physiology may be involved in this relationship. The rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) is an important brain region that processes stress and regulates immune and autonomic functions. Changes in rmPFC activity with emotional stress (reactivity) may be informative of future risk for MACE. Methods: Participants with stable coronary artery disease underwent acute mental stress testing using a series of standardized speech/arithmetic stressors and simultaneous brain imaging with high-resolution positron emission tomography brain imaging. We defined high rmPFC activation as a difference between stress and control scans greater than the median value for the entire cohort. Interleukin-6 levels 90 minutes after stress, and high-frequency heart rate variability during stress were also assessed. We defined MACE as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. Results: We studied 148 subjects (69\\% male) with mean±SD age of 62±8 years. After adjustment for baseline demographics, risk factors, and baseline levels of interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability, higher rmPFC stress reactivity was independently associated with higher interleukin-6 and lower high-frequency heart rate variability with stress. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 34 subjects (21.3\\%) experienced a MACE. Each increase of 1 SD in rmPFC activation with mental stress was associated with a 21\\% increase risk of MACE (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95\\% CI, 1.08-1.37]). Stress-induced interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability explained 15.5\\% and 32.5\\% of the relationship between rmPFC reactivity and MACE, respectively. Addition of rmPFC reactivity to conventional risk factors improved risk reclassification for MACE prediction, and C-statistic improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P=0.03). Conclusions: Greater rmPFC stress reactivity is associated with incident MACE. Immune and autonomic responses to mental stress may play a contributory role.},\n  keywords = {coronary artery disease,heart rate,inflammation,prefrontal cortex,psychological,stress,treatment outcome},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/K3EPKVRI/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968048,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":391},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1042,"entry":"@article{Mostofsky2014,\n  title = {Outbursts of Anger as a Trigger of Acute Cardiovascular Events: {{A}} Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},\n  author = {Mostofsky, Elizabeth and Penner, Elizabeth Anne and Mittleman, Murray A},\n  date = {2014-06-01},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {35},\n  number = {21},\n  eprint = {24591550},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1404--1410},\n  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},\n  issn = {15229645},\n  doi = {10.1093/eurheartj/ehu033},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591550},\n  urldate = {2018-12-25},\n  abstract = {AIM: Short-term psychological stress is associated with an immediate physiological response and may be associated with a transiently higher risk of cardiovascular events.

To address monotone likelihood, previous studies have applied Firth's bias correction method to Cox regression models. However, while the model selection criteria for Firth's penalized partial likelihood approach have not yet been studied, a heuristic AIC-type information criterion can be used in a statistical package. Application of the heuristic information criterion to data obtained from a prospective observational study of patients with multiple brain metastases indicated that the heuristic information criterion selects models with many parameters and ignores the adequacy of the model. Moreover, we showed that the heuristic information criterion tends to select models with many regression parameters as the sample size increases. Thereby, in the present study, we propose an alternative AIC-type information criterion based on the risk function. A Bayesian information criterion type was also evaluated. Further, the presented simulation results confirm that the proposed criteria performed well in a monotone likelihood setting. The proposed AIC-type criterion was applied to prospective observational study data.

Comprehensive and standardised surveillance for non-communicable diseases was recommended at the United Nations High-level meeting in 2011. Aims: To develop a model surveillance system for CMDs and risk factors that could be adopted for continued assessment of burdens from multiple perspectives in South-Asian countries. Methods. Design: Hybrid model with two cross-sectional serial surveys three years apart to monitor trend, with a three-year prospective follow-up of the first cohort. Sites: Three urban settings (Chennai and New Delhi in India; Karachi in Pakistan), 4000 participants in each site stratified by gender and age. Sampling methodology: Multi-stage cluster random sampling; followed by within-household participant selection through a combination of Health Information National Trends Study (HINTS) and Kish methods. Culturally-appropriate and methodologically-relevant data collection instruments were developed to gather information on CMDs and their risk factors; quality of life, health-care utilisation and costs, along with objective measures of anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters. The cohort follow-up is designed as a pilot study to understand the feasibility of estimating incidence of risk factors, disease events, morbidity, and mortality. Results: The overall participant response rate in the first cross-sectional survey was 94.1\\% (Chennai 92.4\\%, n=4943; Delhi 95.7\\%, n=4425; Karachi 94.3\\%, n=4016). 51.8\\% of the participants were females, 61.6\\%{$<$}45years, 27.5\\% 45-60years and 10.9\\% {$>$}60years. Discussion. This surveillance model will generate data on prevalence and trends; help study the complex life-course patterns of CMDs, and provide a platform for developing and testing interventions and tools for prevention and control of CMDs in South-Asia. It will also help understanding the challenges and opportunities in establishing a surveillance system across countries. © 2012 Nair et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n  keywords = {Cardio-metabolic diseases,Risk-factors,South-Asia,Surveillance},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/I2CXKZPL/2012 - Nair et al. - CARRS Surveillance study Design and methods to assess burdens from multiple perspectives.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968066,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":394},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1413,"entry":"@article{Newton-Cheh2007a,\n  title = {Genome-Wide Association Study of Electrocardiographic and Heart Rate Variability Traits: {{The Framingham Heart Study}}},\n  author = {Newton-Cheh, Christopher and Guo, Chao Yu and Wang, Thomas J. and O, Donnell, Christopher J. and Levy, Daniel and Larson, Martin G.},\n  date = {2007-09-19},\n  journaltitle = {BMC Medical Genetics},\n  volume = {8},\n  eprint = {17903306},\n  eprinttype = {pubmed},\n  pages = {S7},\n  issn = {14712350},\n  doi = {10.1186/1471-2350-8-S1-S7},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17903306},\n  urldate = {2020-03-09},\n  abstract = {Background: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits. Methods: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52\\% women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51\\% women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10, call rate ≥ 80\\%, Hardy-Weinberg p-value ≥ 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN). Results: Associations at p {$<$} 10-3 were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values {$<$} 10-3; lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 × 10-4) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007. Conclusion: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population. © 2007 Newton-Cheh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n  issue = {SUPPL. 1},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/8G4CR3KS/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968072,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":395},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1450,"entry":"@article{Nievergelt2015,\n  title = {Genomic Predictors of Combat Stress Vulnerability and Resilience in {{U}}.{{S}}. {{Marines}}: {{A}} Genome-Wide Association Study across Multiple Ancestries Implicates {{PRTFDC1}} as a Potential {{PTSD}} Gene},\n  author = {Nievergelt, Caroline M. and Maihofer, Adam X. and Mustapic, Maja and Yurgil, Kate A. and Schork, Nicholas J. and Miller, Mark W. and Logue, Mark W. and Geyer, Mark A. and Risbrough, Victoria B. and O'Connor, Daniel T. and Baker, Dewleen G.},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  journaltitle = {Psychoneuroendocrinology},\n  volume = {51},\n  eprint = {25456346},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {459--471},\n  issn = {18733360},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.10.017},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25456346},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {Background: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. Methods: Participants (. N=. 3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: The array produced {$>$}800K directly genotyped and {$>$}21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04×10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p{$<$}5×10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. Conclusions: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups.

Data Sources: In this meta-analysis, PubMed was searched from inception until December 31, 2020, for randomized clinical trials of interventions to treat or prevent coronary artery disease reporting mortality and nonfatal MI published in 3 leading journals. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials including at least 1000 patients with 24 months of follow-up. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Trial-level correlations between nonfatal MI and all-cause or CV mortality were assessed for surrogacy using the coefficient of determination (R2). The criterion for surrogacy was set at 0.8. Subgroup analyses based on study subject (primary prevention, secondary prevention, mixed primary and secondary prevention, and revascularization), era of trial (before 2000, 2000-2009, and 2010 and after), and follow-up duration (2.0-3.9, 4.0-5.9, and ≥6.0 years) were performed. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause or CV mortality and nonfatal MI. Results: A total of 144 articles randomizing 1211897 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Nonfatal MI did not meet the threshold for surrogacy for all-cause (R2= 0.02; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.08) or CV (R2= 0.11; 95\\% CI, 0.02-0.27) mortality. Nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality in primary (R2= 0.01; 95\\% CI, 0.001-0.26), secondary (R2= 0.03; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.20), mixed primary and secondary prevention (R2= 0.001; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.08), or revascularization trials (R2= 0.21; 95\\% CI, 0.002-0.50). For trials enrolling patients before 2000 (R2= 0.22; 95\\% CI, 0.08-0.36), between 2000 and 2009 (R2= 0.02; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.17), and from 2010 and after (R2= 0.01; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.09), nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality.

Psychosocial factors have frequently been studied as risk factors for coronary heart disease but not for HF. Methods and Results-We examined the relationship between psychological status and incident HF among 6782 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Anger, anxiety, chronic stress, depressive symptoms, and hostility were measured using validated scales, and physician reviewers adjudicated incident HF events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for relevant demographic, behavioral, and physiological covariates. Interactions by age, race, sex, and self-reported health were examined in exploratory analyses. During a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, 242 participants developed incident HF. There was no association between psychosocial factors and HF hazard ratios (95\\% confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest quartile: anger=1.14 (0.81-1.60), anxiety=0.74 (0.51-1.07), chronic stress = 1.25 (0.90-1.72), depressive symptoms= 1.19 (0.76-1.85), and hostility = 0.95 (0.62-1.42). In exploratory analysis, among the participants reporting fair/poor health at baseline, those reporting high versus low levels of anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms had 2-fold higher risk of incident HF, but there was no association for those with good/very good/excellent self-reported health. Conclusions-Overall, these psychosocial factors were not significantly associated with incident HF. However, for participants reporting poor health at baseline, there was evidence that anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of HF.

Increased HR and reduced HR variability are markers of increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2002, 6814 men and women (2624 Whites, 1895 African-Americans, 1492 Hispanics, and 803 Chinese) aged 45 to 84 years took part in the first examination of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Associations of psychosocial variables with mean values of HR and its short-term variability were tested, using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: In age, gender, race/ethnicity, and risk factor-adjusted analyses, a depressive symptom score was positively associated with HR and inversely associated with HR variability (standard deviation of normal-to-normal (N-N) interbeat intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in N-N intervals (RMSSD)). The adjusted mean differences per 1-SD (8 points) increment of depression score for HR, RMSSD, and SDNN were 0.5 (95\\% confidence interval (CI), 0.2-0.7), -0.8 (95\\% CI, -1.5 to -0.2), and -0.7 (95\\% CI, -1.1 to -0.2). The social support score was inversely associated with HR, but nonsignificantly associated with RMSSD and SDNN. There was no association of trait anger or trait anxiety with HR, RMSSD, or SDNN. Associations were generally consistent in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings generally support the hypothesis that depression may be associated with increased HR and reduced HR variability, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15\\% had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85\\%), PPV (50\\%) and NPV (97\\%) as compared to standard EST (53\\%, 42\\%, 90\\%, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86\\% and 85\\%, respectively).

No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95\\% confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95\\% CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

In this situation, showing a relevant effect with an acceptable power requires the observation of a large number of patients over a long period of time. For feasibility issues, it is therefore often considered to include several event types of interest, non-fatal or fatal, and to combine them within a composite endpoint. Commonly, a composite endpoint is analyzed with standard survival analysis techniques by assessing the time to the first occurring event. This approach neglects that an individual may experience more than one event which leads to a loss of information. As an alternative, composite endpoints could be analyzed by models for recurrent events. There exists a number of such models, e.g. regression models based on count data or Cox-based models such as the approaches of Andersen and Gill, Prentice, Williams and Peterson or, Wei, Lin and Weissfeld. Although some of the methods were already compared within the literature there exists no systematic investigation for the special requirements regarding composite endpoints. Methods Within this work a simulation-based comparison of recurrent event models applied to composite endpoints is provided for different realistic clinical trial scenarios. Results We demonstrate that the Andersen-Gill model and the Prentice- Williams-Petersen models show similar results under various data scenarios whereas the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld model delivers effect estimators which can considerably deviate under commonly met data scenarios.

HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10–24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).},\n  isbn = {1872-7484 (Electronic) 1566-0702 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Anxiety,Autonomic nervous system,Depression,Heart rate variability,Young people}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968140,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":404},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1890,"entry":"@article{Parvez2012a,\n  title = {Symptomatic Response to Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy Is Modulated by a Common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in Atrial Fibrillation},\n  author = {Parvez, Babar and Vaglio, Joseph and Rowan, Shane and Muhammad, Raafia and Kucera, Gayle and Stubblefield, Tanya and Carter, Shannon and Roden, Dan and Darbar, Dawood},\n  date = {2012-08-07},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {60},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {22726630},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {539--545},\n  publisher = {{J Am Coll Cardiol}},\n  issn = {07351097},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2012.01.070},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726630/},\n  urldate = {2022-05-09},\n  abstract = {Objectives: This study tested the hypothesis that response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is modulated by 3 common loci associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 3 loci, on chromosomes 4q25 (near PITX2), 16q22 (in ZFHX3), and 1q21 (in KCNN3), that associate with either typical or lone AF. These findings indicate that variable mechanisms contribute to AF susceptibility, and suggest that response to therapy may be genotype dependent. Methods: We studied 478 and 198 Caucasian patients in the discovery cohort and validation cohort, respectively, who were prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry. Response was defined prospectively as successful rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months with {$<$}75\\% reduction in symptomatic AF burden. We also evaluated AF recurrence by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Symptomatic patients were also given a 24- to 48-h Holter monitor or 30-day event recorder when AF recurrence was not captured by 12-lead ECG.

Multiple clinical variables (including age, hypertension, lone AF) failed to significantly predict response to AADs; however, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10033464 at 4q25 was an independent predictor of successful rhythm control in patients with typical AF carrying the ancestral allele (wild type) versus carriers of variant allele (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7, 95\\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83 to 12, p = 0.0013. In the validation cohort, 143 (72\\%) patients met the criteria for successful rhythm control, and rs10033464 was again an independent predictor of successful rhythm control, OR: 1.5, 95\\% CI: 1.02 to 3.06, p = 0.04. This SNP (rs10033464) was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in the discovery (39\\% AF recurrence) and validation (38\\% AF recurrence) cohorts; OR: 3.27, 95\\% CI: 1.7 to 6, p {$<$} 0.001 and OR: 4.3, 95\\% CI: 1.98 to 9.4, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that a common SNP on chromosome 4q25 associated with AF modulates response to AAD therapy and points to a potential role for stratification of therapeutic approaches by genotype. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},\n  keywords = {antiarrhythmics,atrial fibrillation,genomics,polymorphisms},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/U24Q2JKC/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968148,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":405},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1687,"entry":"@article{Paur2012,\n  title = {High Levels of Circulating Epinephrine Trigger Apical Cardiodepression in a β 2-Adrenergic Receptor/{{Gi-dependent}} Manner: {{A}} New Model of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy},\n  author = {Paur, Helen and Wright, Peter T. and Sikkel, Markus B. and Tranter, Matthew H. and Mansfield, Catherine and O'Gara, Peter and Stuckey, Daniel J. and Nikolaev, Viacheslav O. and Diakonov, Ivan and Pannell, Laura and Gong, Haibin and Sun, Hong and Peters, Nicholas S. and Petrou, Mario and Zheng, Zhaolun and Gorelik, Julia and Lyon, Alexander R. and Harding, Sian E.},\n  date = {2012-08-07},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {126},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {22732314},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {697--706},\n  publisher = {{Europe PMC Funders}},\n  issn = {00097322},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.111591},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC4890655/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-09-20},\n  abstract = {Background-Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute heart failure syndrome characterized by myocardial hypocontractility from the mid left ventricle to the apex. It is precipitated by extreme stress and can be triggered by intravenous catecholamine administration, particularly epinephrine. Despite its grave presentation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rapidly reversible, with generally good prognosis. We hypothesized that this represents switching of epinephrine signaling through the pleiotropic β 2-adrenergic receptor (β 2AR) from canonical stimulatory G-protein-activated cardiostimulant to inhibitory G-protein-activated cardiodepressant pathways. Methods and Results-We describe an in vivo rat model in which a high intravenous epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, bolus produces the characteristic reversible apical depression of myocardial contraction coupled with basal hypercontractility. The effect is prevented via Gi inactivation by pertussis toxin pretreatment. β 2AR number and functional responses were greater in isolated apical cardiomyocytes than in basal cardiomyocytes, which confirmed the higher apical sensitivity and response to circulating epinephrine. In vitro studies demonstrated high-dose epinephrine can induce direct cardiomyocyte cardiodepression and cardioprotection in a β 2AR- Gi-dependent manner. Preventing epinephrine-Gi effects increased mortality in the Takotsubo model, whereas β-blockers that activate β 2AR- Gi exacerbated the epinephrine-dependent negative inotropic effects without further deaths. In contrast, levosimendan rescued the acute cardiac dysfunction without increased mortality. Conclusions-We suggest that biased agonism of epinephrine for β 2AR-Gs at low concentrations and for Gi at high concentrations underpins the acute apical cardiodepression observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with an apical-basal gradient in β 2ARs explaining the differential regional responses. We suggest this epinephrine-specific β 2AR-Gi signaling may have evolved as a cardioprotective strategy to limit catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity during acute stress. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.},\n  keywords = {acute heart failure,adrenergic,beta,catecholamines,receptors,Takotsubo syndrome},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/M4BJ654B/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968160,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":406},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2180,"entry":"@article{Pencina2011,\n  title = {Extensions of Net Reclassification Improvement Calculations to Measure Usefulness of New Biomarkers},\n  author = {Pencina, Michael J. and D'Agostino, Ralph B. and Steyerberg, Ewout W.},\n  date = {2011-01-15},\n  journaltitle = {Statistics in Medicine},\n  volume = {30},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {21204120},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {11--21},\n  issn = {02776715},\n  doi = {10.1002/sim.4085},\n  abstract = {Appropriate quantification of added usefulness offered by new markers included in risk prediction algorithms is a problem of active research and debate. Standard methods, including statistical significance and c statistic are useful but not sufficient. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) offers a simple intuitive way of quantifying improvement offered by new markers and has been gaining popularity among researchers. However, several aspects of the NRI have not been studied in sufficient detail.In this paper we propose a prospective formulation for the NRI which offers immediate application to survival and competing risk data as well as allows for easy weighting with observed or perceived costs. We address the issue of the number and choice of categories and their impact on NRI. We contrast category-based NRI with one which is category-free and conclude that NRIs cannot be compared across studies unless they are defined in the same manner. We discuss the impact of differing event rates when models are applied to different samples or definitions of events and durations of follow-up vary between studies. We also show how NRI can be applied to case-control data. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated in a Framingham Heart Study example.In conclusion, NRI can be readily calculated for survival, competing risk, and case-control data, is more objective and comparable across studies using the category-free version, and can include relative costs for classifications. We recommend that researchers clearly define and justify the choices they make when choosing NRI for their application.

Methods: We applied a machine learning framework using clinical features from the EHR in a multiethnic, clinical care cohort (BioMe) comprising 555 CAD cases and 6,349 control subjects and in a population-based cohort (UK Biobank) comprising 3,130 CAD cases and 378,344 control subjects for external validation.

In all models, the polygenic risk score for CAD did not improve CAD prediction, compared with the PCE or EHR score. Conclusions: The EHR score resulted in increased prediction and reclassification for CAD, demonstrating its potential use for population health monitoring of short-term CAD risk in large health systems.},\n  keywords = {biobank,coronary artery disease,electronic health record,machine learning,polygenic risk score,pooled cohort equations,prevention}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968174,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":409},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":942,"entry":"@article{Petrowski2016,\n  entrysubtype = {newspaper},\n  title = {Effects of {{Mental Stress Induction}} on {{Heart Rate Variability}} in {{Patients}} with {{Panic Disorder}}},\n  author = {Petrowski, Katja and Wichmann, Susann and Siepmann, Timo and Bornstein, Stefan R. and Siepmann, Martin},\n  date = {2016-06-26},\n  journaltitle = {Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback},\n  volume = {42},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {28357597},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1--10},\n  issn = {10900586},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10484-016-9346-9},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889892},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {Abstract Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) constitutes a widely used marker of cardiac autonomic inflexibility which has been linked to disorders such as panic disorder (PD).

Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia.

Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50\\% were female and 60\\% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95\\% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17\\% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95\\% CI: 1.00-1.38).

CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day.

Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37\\%) reported angina; 112 (12\\%) developed mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29\\%) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (19\\% vs 10\\%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95\\% confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11\\% vs 11\\%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.},\n  isbn = {0021-9258 (Print)\\textbackslash r0021-9258 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Angina,Cardiovascular disease,Ischemia,Sex differences}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968195,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":413},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1724,"entry":"@article{Pollitt2008,\n  title = {Cumulative Life Course and Adult Socioeconomic Status and Markers of Inflammation in Adulthood},\n  author = {Pollitt, R.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: 12 681 white and African-American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and two ancillary studies. Methods: Participants provided information on SES and place of residence in childhood and young (30-40 years) and mature (45+) adulthood. Residences were linked to census data for neighbourhood SES information. Multiple imputation (MI) was used for missing data. Linear regression and adjusted geometric means were used to estimate the effects of SES on inflammatory risk marker levels. Results: Graded, statistically significant associations were observed between greater cumulative life-course exposure to low education and social class and elevated levels of fibrinogen and WBC among white participants. Stronger graded, statistically significant associations were observed between low adult education, social class and neighbourhood SES and elevated inflammatory levels. Associations were weaker and less consistent in African-Americans. Covariate adjustment attenuated results but many associations remained strong. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cumulative exposure to adverse SES conditions across the life course and low adult SES are associated with an elevated systemic inflammatory burden in adulthood.

Overview B-splines constitute an appealing method for the nonparametric estimation of a range of statis-tical objects of interest. In this primer we focus our attention on the estimation of a conditional mean, i.e. the 'regression function'. A 'spline' is a function that is constructed piece-wise from polynomial functions. The term comes from the tool used by shipbuilders and drafters to construct smooth shapes having desired properties. Drafters have long made use of a bendable strip fixed in position at a number of points that relaxes to form a smooth curve passing through those points. The malleability of the spline material combined with the constraint of the control points would cause the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy required for bending it between the fixed points, this being the smoothest possible shape. We shall rely on a class of splines called 'B-splines' ('basis-splines'). A B-spline function is the maximally differentiable interpolative basis function. The B-spline is a generalization of the Bézier curve (a B-spline with no 'interior knots' is a Bézier curve). B-splines are defined by their 'order' m and number of interior 'knots' N (there are two 'endpoints' which are themselves knots so the total number of knots will be N +2). The degree of the B-spline polynomial will be the spline order m minus one (degree = m − 1). To best appreciate the nature of B-splines, we shall first consider a simple type of spline, the Bézier function, and then move on to the more flexible and powerful generalization, the B-spline itself. We begin with the univariate case in Section 2 where we consider the univariate Bézier function. In Section 3 we turn to the univariate B-spline function, and then in Section 4 we turn to the multivariate case where we also briefly mention how one could handle the presence of categorical predictors. We presume that interest lies in 'regression spline' methodology which differs in a number of ways from 'smoothing splines', both of which are popular in applied settings. The fundamen-tal difference between the two approaches is that smoothing splines explicitly penalize roughness and use the data points themselves as potential knots whereas regression splines place knots at equidistant/equiquantile points. We direct the interested reader to Wahba (1990) for a treatment of smoothing splines. Date: December 18, 2014. These notes are culled from a variety of sources.

Bézier curves We present an overview of Bézier curves which form the basis for the B-splines that follow. We begin with a simple illustration, that of a quadratic Bézier curve. Example 2.1. A quadratic Bézier curve. A quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced by the function B(x), given points β 0 , β 1 , and β 2 , where B(x) = β 0 (1 − x) 2 + 2β 1 (1 − x)x + β 2 x 2 = 2 i=0 β i B i (x), x ∈ [0, 1]. The terms B 0 (x) = (1 − x) 2 , B 1 (x) = 2(1 − x)x, and B 2 (x) = x 2 are the 'bases' which is this case turn out to be 'Bernstein polynomials' (Bernstein (1912)). For our purposes the 'control points' β i , i = 0, 1, 2, will be parameters that could be selected by least squares fitting in a regression setting, but more on that later.

Methods We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models. Results During mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30\\% women) developed flutter.

We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P {$<$} 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55±0.36 versus 0.76±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.},\n  keywords = {Coronary disease,Ischemia,Mental stress,Vasoconstriction},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ESKGTMI5/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968220,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":418},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1888,"entry":"@article{Ritchie2012,\n  title = {Chromosome 4q25 Variants Are Genetic Modifiers of Rare Ion Channel Mutations Associated with Familial Atrial Fibrillation},\n  author = {Ritchie, Marylyn D. and Rowan, Shane and Kucera, Gayle and Stubblefield, Tanya and Blair, Marcia and Carter, Shannon and Roden, Dan M. and Darbar, Dawood},\n  date = {2012-09-25},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {60},\n  number = {13},\n  eprint = {22818067},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1173--1181},\n  publisher = {{J Am Coll Cardiol}},\n  issn = {07351097},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2012.04.030},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22818067/},\n  urldate = {2022-05-09},\n  abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region that have been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) contribute to the variable penetrance of familial AF. Background: Although mutations in ion channels, gap junction proteins, and signaling molecules have been described for Mendelian forms of AF, penetrance is highly variable. Recent studies have consistently identified 2 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region as independent AF susceptibility alleles. Methods: Eleven families in which AF was present in {$<$}2 members who also shared a candidate gene mutation were studied. These mutations were identified in all subjects with familial lone AF (n = 33) as well as apparently unaffected family members (age {$>$}50 years with no AF; n = 17). Results: Mutations were identified in SCN5A (n = 6), NPPA (n = 2), KCNQ1 (n = 1), KCNA5 (n = 1), and NKX2.5 (n = 1). In genetic association analyses, unstratified and stratified according to age of onset of AF and unaffected age {$>$}50 years, there was a highly statistically significant association between the presence of both common (rs2200733 and rs10033464) and rare variants and AF (unstratified p = 1 × 10-8, stratified [age of onset {$<$}50 years and unaffected age {$>$}50 years] p = 7.6 × 10-5) (unstratified p {$<$} 0.0001, stratified [age of onset {$<$}50 years and unaffected age {$>$}50 years] p {$<$} 0.0001).

A single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2200733, is strongly associated with AF. We sought to characterize the association between rs2200733 and prevalent Afl and to determine if the variant could predict AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Methods and Results We performed a genetic association study of 295 patients with Afl and/or AF and 469 controls using multivariable logistic regression. The variant was then assessed as a predictor of incident AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in 87 consecutive typical Afl patients with Cox proportional hazards models. The rs2200733 rare allele was associated with an adjusted 2.06-fold increased odds of isolated Afl (95\\% CI: 1.13-3.76, P = 0.019) and an adjusted 2.79-fold increased odds of a combined phenotype of AF and Afl (95\\% CI: 1.81-4.28, P {$<$} 0.001). Following catheter ablation for Afl, carrier status of rs2200733 failed to predict an increased risk of AF either among all subjects (adjusted HR: 0.94; 95\\% CI: 0.58-1.53, P = 0.806) or among those with isolated Afl (adjusted HR: 1.29; 95\\% CI: 0.51-3.26, P = 0.585). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that Afl, whether occurring in isolation or along with AF, is associated with the rs2200733 AF risk allele.

Reportedly, non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) have a lower AF burden compared with their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. Information on the epidemiology of AF in Hispanic and Asian populations is much more limited. METHODS We excluded participants with a history of AF at enrollment. A total of 6721 MESA participants were monitored for the first AF event ascertained according to hospital discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) of AF were calculated per 1000 person-years of observation. IR ratios were calculated using NHWs as the reference group. Age- and sex-adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) of established modifiable AF risk factors were ascertained. RESULTS In the MESA cohort, 47.2\\% was male; at baseline, 25.7\\% had hypertension; 12.5\\% had diabetes. Three hundred five incident hospitalized AF events occurred over a mean follow-up of 7.3~years. Age- and sex-adjusted IRs and IR ratios showed that overall AF incidence was significantly lower among Hispanics, NHBs and Chinese compared with NHWs (all P~{$<~$}.001). Among participants 65~years of age or greater, Hispanics, Chinese, and blacks had significantly lower AF incidence than NHWs (all P~≤~.01), but IRs were similar among participants under age 65 years. The PAF for smoking was 27\\% among NHBs but lower among other race-ethnic groups. Among NHWs, the PAF for hypertension was 22.2\\%, but this was higher among NHBs (33.1\\%), Chinese (46.3\\%), and Hispanics (43.9\\%). CONCLUSIONS Overall, the incidence of hospitalized AF was significantly lower in Hispanics, NHBs, and Chinese than in NHWs.

Diabetes-associated fibrosis is mediated by activated cardiac fibroblasts, but may also involve fibrogenic actions of macrophages, cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. The molecular basis responsible for cardiac fibrosis in diabetes remains poorly understood. Hyperglycemia directly activates a fibrogenic program, leading to accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that crosslink extracellular matrix proteins, and transduce fibrogenic signals through reactive oxygen species generation, or through activation of Receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-mediated pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may recruit fibrogenic leukocyte subsets in the cardiac interstitium. Activation of transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling may activate fibroblasts inducing deposition of structural extracellular matrix proteins and matricellular macromolecules.

For mobile applications, short term ECG measurement may be used for HRV analysis since the conventional five minute long recordings might be inadequately long. Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test. We validated these HRV features by showing significant differences in HRV features existed between the two stages.

The main goal of this study is to test the association between SNPs in CDH13 and CTNNA2 genes and ADHD across the life cycle in subjects with ADHD. This study included 1,136 unrelated ADHD cases and 946 individuals without ADHD.

Current national data trends for the incidence, stroke risk profiles, and mortality of hospitalization for NVAF and atrial flutter (AFL) are sparse. Methods: The Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was used to identify patients ≥ 20 years with incident NVAF/AFL (NVAF, ICD-9 code 427.3 or ICD-10 I48) in any diagnosis field from 2006 to 2015 in Canada, except Québec. National and provincial trends in rate over time (rate ratio, 95\\% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for age-sex standardized hospitalizations. Trends in stroke risk profiles and in-hospital mortality rates adjusted for stroke risk factors were also calculated. Results: A total of 578,947 patients were hospitalized with incident NVAF/AFL. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range: 68-84), 82\\% were ≥ 65 years, 54\\% were men, 54\\% had a CHADS2 ≥ 2, and 69\\% had a CHA2DS2-Vasc ≥ 3.

However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P {$<$} 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58\\% in patients versus 52\\% in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22\\% in patients versus 27\\% in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P {$<$} 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P {$<$} 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14\\% +/- 17\\%) than in healthy volunteers (29\\% +/- 14\\%) (P = 0.01).

Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices.

Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity.

An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49\\% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p{$<$}.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n  isbn = {1873-2402 (Electronic) 0006-3223 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,circadian,heart disease,heart rate variability,mental stress,military combat trauma,posttraumatic stress disorder},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7AC8X9GP/2013 - Shah et al. - Posttraumatic stress disorder and impaired autonomic modulation in male twins.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968296,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":434},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":786,"entry":"@article{Shah2014,\n  title = {Sex and Age Differences in the Association of Depression with Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease and Adverse Cardiovascular Events},\n  author = {Shah, Amit J. and Ghasemzadeh, Nima and Zaragoza-Macias, Elisa and Patel, Riyaz and Eapen, Danny J. and Neeland, Ian J. and Pimple, Pratik M. and Zafari, A.

Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged ≤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95\\% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years or women aged {$>$}55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged ≤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95\\% CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years and women aged {$>$}55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction.

The risk of cardiac events is increased during morning hours. Studying the contributions of autonomic mechanisms may yield insights into risk stratification and treatment. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction, measured by decreased heart rate variability (HRV), associates with abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of the association between abnormal myocardial stress perfusion with HRV using 276 middle-aged veteran twins without known ischemic heart disease. The primary independent variable was cardiac autonomic regulation measured with 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using linear and non-linear (multipole density, or Dyx) HRV metrics. The primary outcome was abnormal perfusion ({$>$}5\\% affected myocardium) during adenosine stress on [13N]-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 53 (3) years and 55 (20\\%) had abnormal perfusion. HRV (by Dyx) was reduced during morning hours in subjects with abnormal perfusion. At 7 AM, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in Dyx was associated a 4.8 (95\\% CI, 1.5 - 15.8) odds ratio (OR) for abnormal MPI. With Dyx {$<$} 2.0, the 7 AM OR for abnormal MPI was 11.8 (95\\% CI, 1.2 - 111.4). CONCLUSIONS Autonomic dysfunction, measured by non-linear HRV in the morning hours, was associated with an increased OR of abnormal MPI. These results suggest a potentially important role of ECG-based biomarkers in risk stratification for individuals with suspected ischemic heart disease.},\n  keywords = {★,Autonomic nervous system,Coronary artery disease,Heart rate variability,Myocardial perfusion,Positron emission tomography},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Z8SUYV9X/2020 - Shah et al. - Alterations in heart rate variability are associated with abnormal myocardial perfusion(2).pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968311,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":437},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1478,"entry":"@article{Shah2020a,\n  title = {Abstract {{P542}}: {{Association}} of {{Psychosocial Factors With Heart Rate Variability}}: {{The Atherosclerosis Risk}} in {{Communities Study}}},\n  author = {Shah, Anish S and Alonso, Alvaro and Whitsel, Eric A and Soliman, Elsayed Z and Vaccarino, Viola and Shah, Amit J},\n  date = {2020-03-03},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {141},\n  issn = {0009-7322},\n  doi = {10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.p542},\n  url = {https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.P542},\n  urldate = {2020-03-31},\n  abstract = {Introduction: Psychosocial factors are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but our understanding of causal mechanisms is limited. Understanding such mechanisms may help formulate prevention strategies. We therefore sought to evaluate potential physiologic effects of psychosocial factors by studying their associations with heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Hypothesis: Higher psychosocial stress levels are associated with lower HRV cross-sectionally in a diverse community sample. Methods: We included ARIC cohort participants with information on psychosocial factors in 1990-1992 into our analysis. Psychosocial factors were assessed using validated instruments, including: 1) vital exhaustion, a somatic manifestation of chronic stress and depression, 2) anger proneness, a personality trait, and 3) perceived social support, a potential buffering factor for stress. Short-term time and frequency domain HRV were measured from a two-minute electrocardiographic recording in 1987-1989. Linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We included 9,332 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 5.7 years, 55\\% women, and 25\\% black) in the analysis. Only vital exhaustion was consistently associated with HRV, as per the table, which shows the change in ln(HRV) per point increase in score. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of vital exhaustion was associated with a 13.3\\% (95\\% CI, 3.9\\% - 21.3\\%) decrease in low frequency HRV in adjusted models. By comparison, each year of added age was associated with a 3.7\\% (95\\% CI, 3.1\\% to 4.2\\%) decrease in LF HRV. Conclusion: A high level of vital exhaustion was associated with low HRV, while anger proneness and social support were not.

Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29\\% (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95\\% CI, 1.03 to 1.26; P≥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95\\% CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95\\% CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95\\% CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95\\% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95\\% CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95\\% CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95\\% CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes. Comprehensive screening and treatment of both somatic and cognitive symptoms may be necessary to optimize depression recognition and treatment in AMI patients.

Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. Results: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B per SD increase =.02, 95\\% confidence interval:.00;.05, p =.07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B per SD increase =.28, 95\\% confidence interval:.12;.44, p {$<$}.001).

Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9{$<$}10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7\\%) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4\\%) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1\\% versus 6.7\\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8\\% versus 6.1\\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95\\% confidence interval, 1.39-2.62).

We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Methods: We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples. Findings: SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p{$<$}5×10-8) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers. Interpretation: Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.},\n  isbn = {1474-547X (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0140-6736 (Linking)}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968350,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":445},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2149,"entry":"@article{Soliman2014,\n  title = {The Paradox of Atrial Fibrillation in {{African Americans}}.},\n  author = {Soliman, Elsayed Z and Prineas, Ronald J},\n  date = {2014},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of electrocardiology},\n  volume = {47},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {25112176},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {804--8},\n  issn = {1532-8430},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2014.07.010},\n  abstract = {The reported lower prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) despite the higher prevalence of AF risk factors in African Americans compared to Caucasian whites has been referred to as the paradox of AF in African Americans.

We focus on several approaches to dose-response in occupational cohort studies. Categorical analyses are useful for detecting the shape of dose-response. However, they depend on the number and location of cutpoints and result in step functions rather than smooth curves. Restricted cubic splines and penalized splines are useful parametric techniques that provide smooth curves. Although splines can complement categorical analyses, they do not provide interpretable parameters. The shapes of these curves will depend on the degree of \"smoothing\" chosen by the analyst. We recommend combining categorical analyses and some type of smoother, with the goal of developing a reasonably simple parametric model. A simple parametric model should serve as the goal of dose-response analyses because (1) most \"true\" exposure response curves in nature may be reasonably simple, (2) a simple parametric model is easily communicated and used by others, and (3) a simple parametric model is the best tool for risk assessors and regulators seeking to estimate individual excess risks per unit of exposure. We discuss these issues and others, including whether the best model is always the one that fits the best, reasons to prefer a linear model for risk in the low-exposure region when conducting risk assessment, and common methods of calculating excess lifetime risk at a given exposure from epidemiologic results (eg, from rate ratios).

Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued β-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

Epidemiological data show that chronic stress predicts the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Employees who experience work-related stress and individuals who are socially isolated or lonely have an increased risk of a first CHD event. In addition, short-term emotional stress can act as a trigger of cardiac events among individuals with advanced atherosclerosis. A stress-specific coronary syndrome, known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning cardiomyopathy or stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, also exists. Among patients with CHD, acute psychological stress has been shown to induce transient myocardial ischemia and long-term stress can increase the risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality.

A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March 2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox proportional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. However, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95\\% confidence interval, 1.08-1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (hazard ratio 0.92, 95\\% confidence interval, 0.78-1.09). The association of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with social isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely to be more relevant to mortality.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/KAB52QHD/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968369,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":451},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":997,"entry":"@article{Strike2003,\n  title = {Systematic Review of Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischaemia},\n  author = {Strike, P C and Steptoe, A},\n  date = {2003},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {24},\n  number = {8},\n  pages = {690--703},\n  issn = {0195668X},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0195-668X(02)00615-2},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/24/8/690/2733934},\n  urldate = {2019-10-18},\n  abstract = {There is growing evidence that psychosocial stress can influence the natural history of coronary heart disease.1 Epidemiological studies indicate that psychosocial factors both contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), and increase risk of cardiac dysfunction and the likelihood of cardiac events in susceptible patients with established disease.2,3 An important method of assessing effects on cardiac function is by measuring transient ischaemic responses to standardized mental stress tests. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia (MSIMI) is analogous to exercise stress ischaemia, except that the stimulus is psychological rather than physical. MSIMI has been studied with a number of different imaging techniques and with a range of stressful stimuli. But several investigations have involved small numbers of patients, and the medication status of patients has been variable. This has resulted in diverse findings concerning the prevalence of MSIMI, the conditions in which it is elicited, the type of patients who are most susceptible, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, and its clinical significance. In an effort to clarify these issues, we have conducted a systematic review of studies in which myocardial ischaemic responses have been measured in response to standardized mental stressors in the laboratory and clinic. Relevant articles were identified from searches of PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)between 1980 and 2002. Only articles in English language peer-reviewed publications were examined. We included studies that examined the link between standardized mental stress tests and myocardial ischaemic responses.

APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios {$<$}1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32\\% (95\\% confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23\\% (95\\% confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite.

Methods: In 526 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of clinical paroxysmal/persistent CAFL or AF in our hospital, we enrolled only patients under 60 years old. Cases harboring both AFL and AF were excluded. We analyzed the patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during sinus rhythm, and clinical course after ablation. Results: In total, 196 patients (Cohort 1: 142 males, 156 AF cases) were analyzed. AFL patients were younger than AF patients (47.4 ± 10.6 vs. 50.2 ± 6.4years, p = 0.031) and organic heart disease (OHD) was significantly more common in AFL patients than AF patients (42.5\\% vs. 11.5\\%, p{$<$}0.001).

This study aimed to elucidate the incidences of AF recurrence and of progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF, after CA, in patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods and Results— We examined the incidence of AF recurrence and AF progression in 1220 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 years), with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, undergoing CA, based on extensive pulmonary vein isolation and focal ablation for nonpulmonary vein foci. AF recurrence–free survival probabilities at 5 years were 59.4\\% after the initial CA and 81.1\\% after the final CA (average, 1.3 procedures). During a median follow-up period of 47.9 (range, 5.3–123.3) months after the initial CA, AF progressed from paroxysmal to persistent in 15 (1.2\\%) patients (0.3\\%/y). The duration of AF history (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; P{$<$}0.0001), number of ineffective antiarrhythmics (HR, 1.09; P=0.005), and left atrial diameter indexed by the body surface area (HR, 1.05; P=0.001) were significant predictors of AF recurrence. Patient age (HR, 1.12; P=0.0001) and left atrial diameter indexed by the body surface area (HR, 1.26; P=0.0006) were significantly associated with AF progression.

Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising such markers. The apparently easy derivation of this measure has popularized its use. As many commercial devices now provide automated measurement of HRV, the cardiologist has been pro- vided with a seemingly simple tool for both research and clinical studies[5].

We imaged the amygdala, a brain region involved in stress, to determine whether its resting metabolic activity predicts risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Methods Individuals aged 30 years or older without known cardiovascular disease or active cancer disorders, who underwent 18F-fluorodexoyglucose PET/CT at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2008, were studied longitudinally. Amygdalar activity, bone-marrow activity, and arterial inflammation were assessed with validated methods. In a separate cross-sectional study we analysed the relation between perceived stress, amygdalar activity, arterial inflammation, and C-reactive protein. Image analyses and cardiovascular disease event adjudication were done by mutually blinded researchers. Relations between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events were assessed with Cox models, log-rank tests, and mediation (path) analyses. Findings 293 patients (median age 55 years [IQR 45·0–65·5]) were included in the longitudinal study, 22 of whom had a cardiovascular disease event during median follow-up of 3·7 years (IQR 2·7–4·8). Amygdalar activity was associated with increased bone-marrow activity (r=0·47; p{$<$}0·0001), arterial inflammation (r=0·49; p{$<$}0·0001), and risk of cardiovascular disease events (standardised hazard ratio 1·59, 95\\% CI 1·27–1·98; p{$<$}0·0001), a finding that remained significant after multivariate adjustments. The association between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events seemed to be mediated by increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation in series. In the separate cross-sectional study of patients who underwent psychometric analysis (n=13), amygdalar activity was significantly associated with arterial inflammation (r=0·70; p=0·0083). Perceived stress was associated with amygdalar activity (r=0·56; p=0·0485), arterial inflammation (r=0·59; p=0·0345), and C-reactive protein (r=0·83; p=0·0210). Interpretation In this first study to link regional brain activity to subsequent cardiovascular disease, amygdalar activity independently and robustly predicted cardiovascular disease events. Amygdalar activity is involved partly via a path that includes increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism through which emotional stressors can lead to cardiovascular disease in human beings.

Background--ECG global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is associated with sudden cardiac death. We hypothesized that a genomewide association study would identify genetic loci related to GEH. Methods and Results--We tested genotyped and imputed variants in black (N=3057) and white (N=10 769) participants in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study). GEH (QRS-T angle, sum absolute QRST integral, spatial ventricular gradient magnitude, elevation, azimuth) was measured on 12-lead ECGs. Linear regression models were constructed with each GEH variable as an outcome, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, study site, and principal components to account for ancestry. GWAS identified 10 loci that showed genome-wide significant association with GEH in whites or joint ancestry. The strongest signal (rs7301677, near TBX3) was associated with QRS-T angle (white standardized β+0.16 [95\\% CI 0.13-0.19]; P=1.5×10 -26 ), spatial ventricular gradient elevation (+0.11 [0.08-0.14]; P=2.1×10 -12 ), and spatial ventricular gradient magnitude (-0.12 [95\\% CI -0.15 to -0.09]; P=5.9×10 -15 ). Altogether, GEH-SNPs explained 1.1\\% to 1.6\\% of GEH variance. Loci on chromosomes 4 (near HMCN2), 5 (IGF1R), 11 (11p11.2 region cluster), and 7 (near ACTB) are novel ECG phenotype-associated loci. Several loci significantly associated with gene expression in the left ventricle (HMCN2 locus-with HMCN2; IGF1R locus-with IGF1R), and atria (RP11-481J2.2 locus-with expression of a long non-coding RNA and NDRG4). Conclusions--We identified 10 genetic loci associated with ECG GEH. Replication of GEH GWAS findings in independent cohorts is warranted.

Often, potentially important new predictors are available in addition to the conventional markers. The question is how to quantify the improvement from the new markers for prediction of the patient's risk in order to aid cost-benefit decisions. The standard method, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, to measure the added value may not be sensitive enough to capture incremental improvements from the new markers. Recently, some novel alternatives to area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, such as integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement, were proposed. In this paper, we consider a class of measures for evaluating the incremental values of new markers, which includes the preceding two as special cases. We present a unified procedure for making inferences about measures in the class with censored event time data. The large sample properties of our procedures are theoretically justified.

Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29\\% to 36\\% lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV.

The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14\\% lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006). The CFR in the dizygotic twins with MDD was also lower than in the control twins. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for a shared genetic pathway between MDD and microvascular dysfunction.

Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio {$<$}2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p {$<$} 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of {$<$}2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors. Our results, using a controlled twin design, highlight the importance of coronary microvascular function in the early phases of CAD. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},\n  keywords = {circulation,coronary disease,endothelium,imaging,inflammation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/PRGPW3XS/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968442,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":467},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":953,"entry":"@article{Vaccarino2014,\n  title = {Sex Differences in Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia in Young Survivors of an Acute Myocardial Infarction},\n  author = {Vaccarino, Viola and Shah, Amit J. and Rooks, Cherie and Ibeanu, Ijeoma and Nye, Jonathon A. and Pimple, Pratik and Salerno, Amy and D'Marco, Luis and Karohl, Cristina and Bremner, James Douglas and Raggi, Paolo},\n  date = {2014-04},\n  journaltitle = {Psychosomatic Medicine},\n  volume = {76},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {24608039},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {171--180},\n  issn = {15347796},\n  doi = {10.1097/PSY.0000000000000045},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608039},\n  urldate = {2018-11-25},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emotional stress may disproportionally affect young women with ischemic heart disease.

Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22\\% versus 11\\%, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31\\% versus 16\\%, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.},\n  keywords = {done,Ischemia,Microcirculation,Sex,Stress,Vascular function},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/5GEEJ5UX/2018 - Vaccarino et al. - Mental stress-induced-myocardial ischemia in young patients with recent myocardial infarction Sex differences.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968456,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":470},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1911,"entry":"@article{Vaccarino2021a,\n  title = {Association of {{Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia}} with {{Cardiovascular Events}} in {{Patients}} with {{Coronary Heart Disease}}},\n  author = {Vaccarino, Viola and Almuwaqqat, Zakaria and Kim, Jeong Hwan and Hammadah, Muhammad and Shah, Amit J.

Objective: To compare the association of mental stress-induced or conventional stress-induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020). Exposures: Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure. Results: Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34\\% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16\\%) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31\\%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10\\%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95\\% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95\\% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95\\% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95\\% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95\\% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95\\% CI, 1.5-2.5). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Methods and results: Using data from nationwide Danish health registries, we identified patients aged 18–75 years undergoing a first- time atrial flutter or an AF ablation procedure in the period 2000–13. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) after 5 years of follow-up, adjusting for concomitant risk factors. A total of 1096 and 2266 patients underwent an ablation for atrial flutter or AF, respectively. Age distribution was similar in the two, but atrial flutter patients had more co-morbidities. During 5 years of follow-up, we observed 38 and 36 deaths in the atrial flutter and AF groups, corresponding to an almost two-fold higher mortality rate among atrial flutter patients [crude HR 1.92, 95\\% confidence interval (CI) 1.22–3.03]. The higher mortality rate persisted after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (adjusted HR 1.68, 95\\% CI 1.05–2.69).

The development of both is favored by the presence of common triggers and substrate, particularly in the setting of structural heart disease with its attendant electrical and structural remodel-ing. Conditions associated with atrial remodeling, including heart failure, hypertension, increasing age and valvular heart disease, predispose to both fibrillation and flutter. The nature of the \"peri-tricuspid\" macroreentry circuit, constrained by structural and functional barriers to electrical propagation, is now well understood. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that CTI-dependent AFL is most frequently preceded by a period of short cycle length atrial activation, and in particular by a period of AF. 1-4 Such activity induces regions of functional conduction block and slowed conduction that are necessary for the transition from multiple unstable wavefronts to a single organized circuit. 5,6 The development of functional conduction block along the crista terminalis seems particularly important in the patho-genesis of CTI-dependent AFL. 7-9 Thus the same pulmonary vein (PV) and non-PV triggers that initiate AF are also responsible , via transitional AF, for onset of the great majority of AFL episodes. This background is of prime importance when considering the accumulated literature evaluating the incidence of AF late after AFL ablation. This incidence is clearly time-dependent with reported rates of 17-22\\% at 6 months, increasing to 50\\% at 2 years and 63\\% at 4 years. 10,11 The most consistently identified risk factor for the development of post-ablation AF is documented pre-ablation AF, the prevalence of which varies according to the intensity of monitoring, 10-14 Other identified risk factors have included left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, 12,14 significant mitral regurgitation, 10 left atrial (LA) enlargement, 11,15 and the failure of multiple antiarrhyth-mic drugs (AADs). 14 All are associated with LA remodeling and an elevated risk of incident AF regardless of AFL abla-tion. Importantly, the incidence of AF after AFL ablation is also proportional to the intensity of monitoring. In a small study of patients who had loop recorders implanted after flutter ablation, 55\\% developed new AF within the first year of follow-up. 16 It seems probable that the variability in the reported incidence of post-ablation AF is related in large part to varying intensities of monitoring. In this issue of the Journal, Brembilla-Perrot and colleagues 17 further explore the incidence of and risk factors for AF following ablation of AFL. They present a large single-center series of 1,121 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation of CTI-dependent AFL, with data retrospectively extracted by chart review. A history of AF before AFL ablation was present in 31.8\\% of patients, but the nature of pre-ablation monitoring to determine this is not described. It is probable that the real AF incidence before ablation was much higher. Follow-up was continued for a mean of 2.1 ± 2.7 years, and included ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring at 1 month but thereafter only at annual intervals or for investigation of symptoms. Using this approach, new AF was observed during follow-up in 19.3\\% of patients without pre-ablation AF, but ongoing AF was only detected in 31.5\\% of patients who did have pre-ablation AF. The study thus observed a fall in the overall AF incidence post-ablation (23.2\\%) compared with pre-ablation (31.8\\%), with a particularly marked fall in the group with AF before AFL ablation. This result should be viewed in the context of the limited post-ablation monitoring performed. Nevertheless, the ongoing involvement with the healthcare system remained significant with 8\\% developing permanent AF, 7\\% requiring electrical cardioversion, 7\\% atrio-ventricular node ablation and 15\\% pacemaker implantation. These data certainly make it difficult to argue that AFL ablation in this population provides a definitive result. Only AF history and female gender were significant pre-dictors of AF occurrence post-ablation. Other established markers of AF risk such as age, hypertension, diabetes and various forms of structural heart disease were not associated with post-ablation AF in this study. Importantly, at the time of ablation 50.5\\% had a CHADS 2 score 1 and although only 2 strokes occurred during follow-up both were in patients who were not anti-coagulated and who had AF recurrence.},\n  keywords = {atrial flutter,clinical: catheter ablation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7NNETFNB/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968497,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":479},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1155,"entry":"@article{Wang2014b,\n  title = {Social Support Moderates Stress Effects on Depression},\n  author = {Wang, Xingmin and Cai, Lin and Qian, Jing and Peng, Jiaxi},\n  date = {2014},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Mental Health Systems},\n  volume = {8},\n  number = {1},\n  publisher = {{BioMed Central Ltd.}},\n  issn = {17524458},\n  doi = {10.1186/1752-4458-8-41},\n  abstract = {This study examined the moderator effect of social support on the relationship between stress and depression of university students.

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of {$<$}200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85\\% male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95\\% confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0\\%, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of \"hard\" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95\\% CI) was 1.54 (95\\% CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95\\% CI 1.17 to 2.64) for \"hard\" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of \"hard\" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger. The multivariate-adjusted HR of CHD for high versus low anger was 2.20 (95\\% CI 1.36 to 3.55) and for moderate versus low anger was 1.32 (95\\% CI 0.94 to 1.84).

Methods: The study included patients with an ECG recorded at the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory in 2001 to 2011. PTFV1 ≥4 mV·ms was considered abnormal. Patients with abnormal PTFV1 were stratified into tertiles based on duration (PTDV1) and amplitude (PTAV1) values. Cox regressions adjusted for age, sex, and relevant comorbidities were used to investigate associations between abnormal PTFV1 components and AF and stroke/TIA. Results: Of 267,636 patients, 5803 had AF and 18,176 had stroke/TIA (follow-up 6.5 years). Abnormal PTFV1 was present in 44,549 subjects (16.7\\%) and was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Among patients with abnormal PTFV1, the highest tertile of PTDV1 (78–97 ms) was associated with the highest risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.37; 95\\% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–1.52) and highest risk of stroke/TIA (HR 1.13; 95\\% CI 1.05 –1.20).

In ventricular cardiomyocytes, the membrane deformation protein cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1 or BIN1+13+17) creates transverse-tubule (t-tubule) membrane microfolds, which facilitate ion channel trafficking and modulate local ionic concentrations. The microfold-generated microdomains continuously reorganize, adapting in response to stress to modulate the calcium signaling apparatus. We explored the possibility that cBIN1-microfolds are externally released from cardiomyocytes. Using electron microscopy imaging with immunogold labeling, we found in mouse plasma that cBIN1 exists in membrane vesicles about 200 nm in size, which is consistent with the size of MPs. In mice with cardiac-specific heterozygous Bin1 deletion, flow cytometry identified 47\\% less cBIN1-MPs in plasma, supporting cardiac origin. Cardiac release was also evidenced by the detection of cBIN1-MPs in medium bathing a pure population of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. In human plasma, osmotic shock increased cBIN1 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cBIN1 level decreased in humans with heart failure, a condition with reduced cardiac muscle cBIN1, both of which support cBIN1 release in MPs from human hearts. Exploring putative mechanisms of MP release, we found that the membrane fission complex endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B) colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with cBIN1, an interaction enhanced by actin stabilization. In HeLa cells with cBIN1 overexpression, knockdown of CHMP4B reduced the release of cBIN1-MPs. Using truncation mutants, we identified that the N-terminal BAR (N-BAR) domain in cBIN1 is required for CHMP4B binding and MP release. This study links the BAR protein superfamily to the ESCRT pathway for MP biogenesis in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells, identifying elements of a pathway by which cytoplasmic cBIN1 is released into blood.},\n  isbn = {1111111111}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968523,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":485},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1637,"entry":"@article{Yannopoulos2019,\n  title = {The {{Evolving Role}} of the {{Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory}} in the {{Management}} of {{Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest}}: {{A Scientific Statement From}} the {{American Heart Association}}},\n  author = {Yannopoulos, Demetris and Bartos, Jason A. and Aufderheide, Tom P. and Callaway, Clifton W. and Deo, Rajat and Garcia, Santiago and Halperin, Henry R. and Kern, Karl B. and Kudenchuk, Peter J. and Neumar, Robert W. and Raveendran, Ganesh},\n  date = {2019-03-19},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {139},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {30760026},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {e530-e552},\n  publisher = {{NLM (Medline)}},\n  issn = {15244539},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIR.0000000000000630},\n  url = {http://ahajournals.org},\n  urldate = {2020-08-26},\n  abstract = {Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT).

Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70\\% to 85\\%. More than 90\\% of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25\\% to 50\\%. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10\\% to 15\\% absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9\\% to 45\\% in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.},\n  keywords = {AHA Scientific Statements,cardiac catheterization,laboratories,out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,percutaneous coronary intervention,tachycardia,ventricular,ventricular fibrillation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/43NUA4I7/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968529,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":486},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1992,"entry":"@article{Yeboah2016,\n  title = {Utility of {{Nontraditional Risk Markers}} in {{Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment}}},\n  author = {Yeboah, Joseph and Young, Rebekah and McClelland, Robyn L. and Delaney, Joseph C. and Polonsky, Tamar S. and Dawood, Farah Z. and Blaha, Michael J. and Miedema, Michael D. and Sibley, Christopher T. and Carr, J.

Methods The PCE was calibrated (cPCE) and used for this analysis. The Cox proportional hazards survival model, Harrell's C statistics, and net reclassification improvement analyses were used. ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease-related death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Results Of 6,814 MESA participants not prescribed statins at baseline, 5,185 had complete data and were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 61 years; 53.1\\% were women, 9.8\\% had diabetes, and 13.6\\% were current smokers. After 10 years of follow-up, 320 (6.2\\%) ASCVD events occurred. CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events in the multivariable Cox models. CAC score modestly improved the Harrell's C statistic (0.74 vs. 0.76; p = 0.04); ABI, hsCRP levels, and FH produced no improvement in Harrell's C statistic when added to the cPCE. Conclusions CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events.

Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports.

Objective: To examine the results of genetic testing for early-onset AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled participants from an academic medical center who had AF diagnosed before 66 years of age and underwent whole genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. Participants were enrolled from November 23, 1999, to June 2, 2015. Data analysis was performed from October 24, 2020, to March 11, 2021. Exposures: Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included on cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sequencing data were analyzed using an automated process followed by manual review by a panel of independent, blinded reviewers. The primary outcome was classification of rare variants using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria: benign, likely benign, variant of undetermined significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. Disease-associated variants were defined as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes associated with autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant disorders. Results: Among 1293 participants (934 [72.2\\%] male; median [interquartile range] age at enrollment, 56 [48-61] years; median [interquartile range] age at AF diagnosis, 50 [41-56] years), genetic testing identified 131 participants (10.1\\%) with a disease-associated variant, 812 (62.8\\%) with a variant of undetermined significance, 92 (7.1\\%) as heterozygous carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder, and 258 (20.0\\%) with no suspicious variant. The likelihood of a disease-associated variant was highest in participants with AF diagnosed before the age of 30 years (20 of 119 [16.8\\%; 95\\% CI, 10.0\\%-23.6\\%]) and lowest after the age of 60 years (8 of 112 [7.1\\%; 95\\% CI, 2.4\\%-11.9\\%]). Disease-associated variants were more often associated with inherited cardiomyopathy syndromes compared with inherited arrhythmias. The most common genes were TTN (n = 38), MYH7 (n = 18), MYH6 (n = 10), LMNA (n = 9), and KCNQ1 (n = 8). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, genetic testing identified a disease-associated variant in 10\\% of patients with early-onset AF (the percentage was higher if diagnosed before the age of 30 years and lower if diagnosed after the age of 60 years). Most pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants are in genes associated with cardiomyopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study included participants with AF diagnosed before 66 years of age who underwent whole-genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program.

Exposures Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was time to death and was adjudicated from medical records and the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association of disease-associated variants with risk of death after adjustment for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term of age at AF diagnosis and disease-associated variant status. Results Among 1293 participants (934 [72\\%] male; median age at enrollment, 56.0 years; IQR, 48.0-61.0 years), disease-associated (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) rare variants were found in 131 (10\\%). During a median follow-up of 9.9 years (IQR, 6.9-13.2 years), 219 participants (17\\%) died. In univariable analysis, disease-associated variants were associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, [HR], 1.5; 95\\% CI, 1.0-2.1;P = .05); the association remained significant in multivariable modeling when adjusted for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term between disease-associated variant status and age at AF diagnosis. The interaction demonstrated that disease-associated variants were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with no disease-associated variant when AF was diagnosed at a younger age (P = .008 for interaction). Higher body mass index (per IQR: HR, 1.4; 95\\% CI, 1.2-1.6;P {$<$} .001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (per IQR: HR, 0.8; 95\\% CI, 0.7-0.8;P {$<$} .001) were associated with higher mortality risk. There were 73 cardiomyopathy-related deaths, 40 sudden deaths, and 10 stroke-related deaths. Mortality among patients with the most prevalent genes with disease-associated variants was 26\\% (10 of 38 patients) forTTN, 33\\% (6 of 18) forMYH7, 22\\% (2 of 9) forLMNA, 0\\% (0 of 10) forMYH6, and 0\\% (0 of 8) forKCNQ1. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes may be associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with early-onset AF, especially those diagnosed at a younger age.

GWASs of three metabolites identified previously as risk factors for incident HF (pyroglutamine, dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid, and X-11787, being either hydroxy-leucine or hydroxy-isoleucine) were performed in 1,260 African Americans free of HF at the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. A significant association on chromosome 5q33 (rs10463316, MAF = 0.358, P-value = 1.92 × 10(-10) ) was identified for pyroglutamine.

Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory (\"Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test\", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed (\"Digit Symbol Substitution Test\", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function (\"Stroop interference\"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7\\% female, 42.2\\% Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: β = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: β = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: β = 1.19 points better, P {$<$} 0.05; and quartile2: β = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: β = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: β = 1.72 points better, P {$<$} 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that higher quartile SDDN is associated with better executive function in midlife, above, and beyond cardiovascular risk factors.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968570,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":493},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1389,"entry":"@article{Zhang2015a,\n  title = {Increased Plasma {{BMP-2}} Levels Are Associated with Atherosclerosis Burden and Coronary Calcification in Type 2 Diabetic Patients},\n  author = {Zhang, Ming and Sara, Jaskanwal Deep and Wang, Fei Long and Liu, Li Ping and Su, Li Xiao and Zhe, Jing and Wu, Xi and Liu, Jing Hua},\n  date = {2015-05-24},\n  journaltitle = {Cardiovascular Diabetology},\n  volume = {14},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {26003174},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {64},\n  publisher = {{BioMed Central}},\n  issn = {14752840},\n  doi = {10.1186/s12933-015-0214-3},\n  url = {http://www.cardiab.com/content/14/1/64},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a known mediator of bone regeneration and vascular calcification, to date no study has investigated the relationship between BMP-2 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its possible role in coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship of BMP-2 with atherosclerosis and calcification in patients with T2DM.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nMETHODS: 124 subjects were enrolled in this study: 29 patients with T2DM and CAD; 26 patients with T2DM and without CAD; 36 patients with CAD and without T2DMand 34 without T2DM or CAD (control group). Severity of coronary lesions was assessed using coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Plasma BMP-2 levels were quantified using a commercially available ELISA kit.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nRESULTS: Compared to the control group, the mean plasma BMP-2 level was significantly higher in T2DM patients with or without CAD (20.1 ± 1.7 or 19.3 ± 1.5 pg/ml, vs 17.2 ± 3.3 pg/ml, P {$<$}0.001). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, both T2DM and CAD were significantly and positively associated with BMP-2 (Estimate, 0.249; standard error (SE), 0.063; p {$<$}0.0001; Estimate, 0.400; SE, 0.06; p {$<$}0.0001). Plasma BMP-2 was also strongly correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (Spearman ρ = -0.31; p = 0.0005). SYNTAX score was also significantly associated with BMP-2 (Spearman ρ = 0.46; p = 0.0002). Using the results from IVUS, plasma BMP-2 levels were shown to positively correlate with plaque burden (Spearman ρ = 0.38, P = 0.002) and plaque calcification (Spearman ρ =0.44, P = 0.0003) and to negatively correlate with lumen volume (Spearman ρ =0.31, P = 0.01).\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that patients with T2DM had higher circulating levels of BMP-2 than normal controls.

The most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the e4 allele of APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E, a lipid carrier shown to modulate brain amyloid burden. Recent genome-wide association studies have uncovered additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to AD susceptibility, including those in the CLU and BIN1 genes encoding for clusterin (CLU) and the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) proteins, respectively. Because CLU has been implicated in brain amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance in mouse models of amyloid deposition, we sought to investigate whether an AD-linked SNP in the CLU gene altered Aβ42 biomarker levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, we found that the CLU rs11136000 SNP modified CSF levels of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in AD patients. We also found that an intracellular form of CLU (iCLU) was upregulated in the brain of Tau overexpressing Tg4510 mice, but not in Tg2576 amyloid mouse model. By overexpressing iCLU and Tau in cell culture systems we discovered that iCLU was a Tau-interacting protein and that iCLU associated with brain-specific isoforms of BIN1, also recently identified as a Tau-binding protein. Through expression analysis of CLU and BIN1 variants, we found that CLU and BIN1 interacted via their coiled-coil motifs. In co-immunoprecipitation studies using human brain tissue, we showed that iCLU and the major BIN1 isoform expressed in neurons were associated with modified Tau species found in AD. Finally, we showed that expression of certain coding CLU variants linked to AD risk led to increased levels of iCLU. Together, our findings suggest that iCLU and BIN1 interaction might impact Tau function in neurons and uncover potential new mechanisms underlying the etiology of Tau pathology in AD.},\n  isbn = {1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968578,"version":0,"updated":1686537836840},"$loki":495},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2087,"entry":"@article{Zöller2013,\n  title = {High Familial Risk of Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter in Multiplex Families: A Nationwide Family Study in {{Sweden}}.},\n  author = {Zöller, Bengt and Ohlsson, Henrik and Sundquist, Jan and Sundquist, Kristina},\n  date = {2013},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American Heart Association},\n  volume = {2},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {23525409},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  issn = {20479980},\n  doi = {10.1161/JAHA.112.003384},\n  abstract = {Although the heritability of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFl) has been determined, the familial risk in multiplex families is unclear. The main aim of this nationwide study was to determine the familial risk of AF/AFl in multiplex families. We examined the familial risk of AF/AFl in the entire Swedish population. We linked Multigeneration Register data on individuals aged 0 to 76 years with Hospital Discharge Register data for 1987-2008 and Outpatient Register data for 2001-2008 to compare AF/AFl risk among relatives of all 300 586 individuals with AF/AFl with that among relatives of unaffected individuals. We used conditional logistic regression to investigate differences in exposure between cases and controls. Parents (odds ratio [OR] 1.95 [95\\% CI 1.89 to 2.00]) and siblings (OR=3.08 [3.00 to 3.16]) of cases had higher odds of AF/AFl than did parents and siblings of controls. AF/AFl ORs were increased in both sexes. For 2\\% of cases, both parents had AF/AFl, compared with only 0.7\\% of controls (OR=3.60 [3.30 to 3.92]). Moreover, 3\\% of cases had ≥2 siblings with AF/AFl, compared with 1\\% of controls (OR=5.72 [5.28 to 6.19]). In premature cases (diagnosed at age {$<$}50 years), the ORs were 5.04 (4.36 to 5.82) and 8.51 (6.49 to 11.15) for AF/AFl in both parents and AF/AFl in ≥2 siblings, respectively. The overall spouse OR was 1.16 (1.13 to 1.19). Family history of AF/AFl increases the odds of AF/AFl in first-degree relatives.

METHODS: Using the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF, we analysed the incidence and predictors of progression and tested the discrimination and calibration of the HATCH (hypertension, age, TIA/stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure) and CHA₂DS₂VASc scores for identifying AF progression. RESULTS: Among 6235 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF at baseline, 1479 progressed, during follow-up (median 18 (IQR 12-24) months). These patients were older and had more comorbidities than patients who did not progress (CHADS₂ 2.3±1.3 vs 2.1±1.3, p{$<$}0.0001). At baseline, patients with AF progression were more often on a rate control as opposed to a rhythm control strategy (66 vs 56\\%, p{$<$}0.0001) and had higher heart rate (72(64-80) vs 68(60-76) bpm, p{$<$}0.0001). The strongest predictors of AF progression were AF on the baseline ECG (OR 2.30, 95\\% CI 1.95 to 2.73, p{$<$}0.0001) and increasing age (OR 1.16, 95\\% CI1.09 to 1.24, p{$<$}0.0001, per 10 increase), while patients with lower heart rate (OR 0.84, 95\\% CI 0.79 to 0.89, p{$<$}0.0001, per 10 decrease ≤80) were less likely to progress. There was no significant interaction between rhythm on baseline ECG and heart rate (p=0.71). The HATCH and CHA₂DS₂VASc scores had modest discriminatory power for AF progression (C-indices 0.55 (95\\% CI 0.53 to 0.58) and 0.55 (95\\% CI 0.52 to 0.57)).
