We sought to determine the long-term associations of various LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) thresholds and CVD and coronary heart disease mortality in a large, low 10-year risk cohort. Methods: The study sample included participants of the CCLS (Cooper Center Longitudinal Study) without a history of CVD or diabetes mellitus and defined as low risk ({$<$}7.5\\%) for 10-year atherosclerotic CVD events at baseline based on Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. The associations of fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In 36 375 participants (72\\% men, median age 42) followed for a median of 26.8 years, 1086 CVD and 598 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. Compared with LDL-C {$<$}100 mg/dL, LDL-C categories 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, 160 to 189.9 mg/dL, and ≥190 mg/dL were associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (95\\% CI, 1.1-1.7), 1.3 (95\\% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.9 (95\\% CI, 1.5-2.4), and 1.7 (95\\% CI, 1.3-2.3), and mean reductions in years free of CVD death of 1.8, 1.1, 4.3, and 3.9, respectively. After adjustment for atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, LDL-C categories 160 to 189 mg/dL and ≥190 mg/dL remained independently associated with CVD mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95\\% CI, 1.4-2.2) and 1.5 (95\\% CI, 1.2-2.1), respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models using non-HDL-C {$<$}130 mg/dL as the reference, non-HDL-C 160 to 189 mg/dL, 190 to 219 mg/dL, and ≥220 mg/dL were significantly associated with CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.3 (95\\% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.8 (95\\% CI, 1.4-2.2), and 1.5 (95\\% CI, 1.2-2.0), respectively. Restricting the cohort to those with 10-year risk {$<$}5\\% did not diminish the associations of LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality. Conclusions: In a low 10-year risk cohort with long-term follow-up, LDL-C and non-HDL-C ≥160 mg/dL were independently associated with a 50\\% to 80\\% increased relative risk of CVD mortality.

However, a direct link between PTSD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been made. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an excellent method to detect atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association of PTSD to atherosclerotic CAD and mortality. Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 ± 9 years of age, 12.2\\% women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1\\% vs 59\\%, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p {$<$}0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1\\%, vs 57, 10.4\\%, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95\\% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score {$>$}0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95\\% CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores {$<$}400, p {$<$}0.05 for all comparisons).

This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95\\% CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95\\% CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95\\%CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95\\% CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression. Further, we found a higher risk of CVD among depressed individuals with symptoms of anxious distress.},\n  isbn = {1932-6203}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535966942,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":252},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1150,"entry":"@article{Amorim2015a,\n  title = {Modelling Recurrent Events: {{A}} Tutorial for Analysis in Epidemiology},\n  author = {Amorim, Leila D.A.F. and Cai, Jianwen},\n  date = {2015},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Epidemiology},\n  volume = {44},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {324--333},\n  issn = {14643685},\n  doi = {10.1093/ije/dyu222},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/44/1/324/654595},\n  urldate = {2019-12-21},\n  abstract = {In many biomedical studies, the event of interest can occur more than once in a participant.

The aim of this article is to review the clinical epidemiological features of AF and to relate them to underlying mechanisms. Long-established risk factors for AF include aging, male sex, hypertension, valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Emerging risk factors include prehypertension, increased pulse pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, high-level physical training, diastolic dysfunction, predisposing gene variants, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. Potential risk factors are coronary artery disease, kidney disease, systemic inflammation, pericardial fat, and tobacco use. AF has substantial population health consequences, including impaired quality of life, increased hospitalization rates, stroke occurrence, and increased medical costs. The pathophysiology of AF centers around 4 general types of disturbances that promote ectopic firing and reentrant mechanisms, and include the following: (1) ion channel dysfunction, (2) Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities, (3) structural remodeling, and (4) autonomic neural dysregulation. Aging, hypertension, valve disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and endurance exercise training all cause structural remodeling. Heart failure and prior atrial infarction also cause Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities that lead to focal ectopic firing via delayed afterdepolarizations/triggered activity. Neural dysregulation is central to atrial arrhythmogenesis associated with endurance exercise training and occlusive coronary artery disease. Monogenic causes of AF typically promote the arrhythmia via ion channel dysfunction, but the mechanisms of the more common polygenic risk factors are still poorly understood and under intense investigation. Better recognition of the clinical epidemiology of AF, as well as an improved appreciation of the underlying mechanisms, is needed to develop improved methods for AF prevention and management.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535966959,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":254},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2874,"entry":"@article{Andrade2023,\n  title = {Progression of {{Atrial Fibrillation}} after {{Cryoablation}} or {{Drug Therapy}}},\n  author = {Andrade, Jason G. and Deyell, Marc W. and Macle, Laurent and Wells, George A. and Bennett, Matthew and Essebag, Vidal and Champagne, Jean and Roux, Jean-Francois and Yung, Derek and Skanes, Allan and Khaykin, Yaariv and Morillo, Carlos and Jolly, Umjeet and Novak, Paul and Lockwood, Evan and Amit, Guy and Angaran, Paul and Sapp, John and Wardell, Stephan and Lauck, Sandra and Cadrin-Tourigny, Julia and Kochhäuser, Simon and Verma, Atul},\n  date = {2023-01-12},\n  journaltitle = {New England Journal of Medicine},\n  volume = {388},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {105--116},\n  publisher = {{Massachusetts Medical Society}},\n  issn = {0028-4793},\n  doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa2212540},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2212540},\n  urldate = {2023-06-11},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Users\\\\asshah4\\\\projects\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\924U3BUV\\\\Andrade et al. - 2023 - Progression of Atrial Fibrillation after Cryoablat.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535966981,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":255},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1406,"entry":"@article{Anttila2013,\n  title = {Genome-Wide Meta-Analysis Identifies New Susceptibility Loci for Migraine},\n  author = {Anttila, Verneri and Winsvold, Bendik S and Gormley, Padhraig and Kurth, Tobias and Bettella, Francesco and McMahon, George and Kallela, Mikko and Malik, Rainer and De Vries, Boukje and Terwindt, Gisela and Medland, Sarah E and Todt, Unda and McArdle, Wendy L and Quaye, Lydia and Koiranen, Markku and Ikram, Marfan and Lehtimäki, Terho and Stam, Anine H and Ligthart, Lannie and Wedenoja, Juho and Dunham, Ian and Neale, Benjamin M and Palta, Priit and Hamalainen, Eija and Schürks, Markus and Rose, Lynda M and Buring, Julie E and Ridker, Paul M and Steinberg, Stacy and Stefansson, Hreinn and Jakobsson, Finnbogi and Lawlor, Debbie A and Evans, David M and Ring, Susan M and Färkkilä, Markus and Artto, Ville and Kaunisto, Mari A and Freilinger, Tobias and Schoenen, Jean and Frants, Rune R and Pelzer, Nadine and Weller, Claudia M and Zielman, Ronald and Heath, Andrew C and Madden, Pamela A.F. and Montgomery, Grant W and Martin, Nicholas G and Borck, Guntram and Göbel, Hartmut and Heinze, Axel and Kuhn, Katja Heinze and Williams, Frances M.K. and Hartikainen, Anna Liisa and Pouta, Anneli and Van Den Ende, Joyce and Uitterlinden, Andre G and Hofman, Albert and Amin, Najaf and Hottenga, Jouke Jan and Vink, Jacqueline M and Heikkilä, Kauko and Alexander, Michael and Myhsok, Bertram Muller and Schreiber, Stefan and Meitinger, Thomas and Wichmann, Heinz Erich and Aromaa, Arpo and Eriksson, Johan G and Traynor, Bryan J and Trabzuni, Daniah and Rossin, Elizabeth and Lage, Kasper and Jacobs, Suzanne B.R. and Gibbs, J Raphael and Birney, Ewan and Kaprio, Jaakko and Penninx, Brenda W and Boomsma, Dorret I and Van Duijn, Cornelia and Raitakari, Olli and Jarvelin, Marjo Riitta and Zwart, John Anker and Cherkas, Lynn and Strachan, David P and Kubisch, Christian and Ferrari, Michel D and Van Den Maagdenberg, Arn Mjm J.M. and Dichgans, Martin and Wessman, Maija and Smith, George Davey and Stefansson, Kari and Daly, Mark J and Nyholt, Dale R and Chasman, Daniel I. and Palotie, Aarno},\n  date = {2013-08-23},\n  journaltitle = {Nature Genetics},\n  volume = {45},\n  number = {8},\n  eprint = {23793025},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {912--917},\n  issn = {10614036},\n  doi = {10.1038/ng.2676},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23793025},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {Migraine is the most common brain disorder, affecting approximately 14\\% of the adult population, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.

In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.},\n  keywords = {dorsal root ganglion afferent,intrinsic cardiac nervous system,local circuit neurone,myocardial ischemia,neurone,nodose ganglion afferent,parasympathetic efferent neurone,sympathetic efferent neurone},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3ZC5WU2X/1999 - Armour - Myocardial ischaemia and the cardiac nervous system.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967023,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":257},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":958,"entry":"@article{Arri2016,\n  title = {Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischaemia},\n  author = {Arri, S S and Ryan, M and Redwood, S R and Marber, M S},\n  date = {2016-03},\n  journaltitle = {Heart},\n  volume = {102},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {25727240},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {472--480},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  issn = {1355-6037},\n  doi = {10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307306},\n  url = {http://heart.bmj.com/},\n  urldate = {2018-12-17},\n  abstract = {Objective: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor.

A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50\\% were female and 60\\% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95\\% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17\\% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95\\% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12\\% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95\\% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},\n  isbn = {9783319324807},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VVUPBR2G/2016 - Arri et al. - Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967034,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":258},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":976,"entry":"@article{Arrighi2000,\n  title = {Myocardial Bloodflow Response during Mental Stress in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease},\n  author = {Arrighi, James A and Burg, Matthew and Cohen, Ira S and Kao, Alexander H and Pfau, Steven and Caulin-Glaser, Teresa and Zaret, Barry L and Soufer, Robert},\n  date = {2000-07-22},\n  journaltitle = {Lancet},\n  volume = {356},\n  number = {9226},\n  eprint = {11071190},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {310--311},\n  issn = {01406736},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02510-1},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071190},\n  urldate = {2018-12-01},\n  abstract = {Positron emission tomography was used to quantify changes in myocardial blood flow during mental stress in patients with and without coronary artery disease.

The increasing incidence of diabetes in young individuals is particularly worrisome given that the disease is likely to evolve over a period of years. In 1972, the existence of a diabetic cardiomyopathy was proposed based on the experience with four adult diabetic patients who suffered from congestive heart failure in the absence of discernible coronary artery disease, valvular or congenital heart disease, hypertension, or alcoholism. The exact mechanisms underlying the disease are unknown; however, an important component of the pathological alterations observed in these hearts includes the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in particular collagens. The excess deposition of ECM in the heart mirrors what occurs in other organs such as the kidney and peritoneum of diabetics. Mechanisms responsible for these alterations may include the excess production, reduced degradation, and/or chemical modification of ECM proteins. These effects may be the result of direct or indirect actions of high glucose concentrations. This article reviews our state of knowledge on the effects that diabetes-like conditions exert on the cells responsible for ECM production as well as relevant experimental and clinical data. © 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/HJK9EHWM/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967050,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":260},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1501,"entry":"@article{Austin2016,\n  title = {Introduction to the {{Analysis}} of {{Survival Data}} in the {{Presence}} of {{Competing Risks}}},\n  author = {Austin, Peter C. and Lee, Douglas S. and Fine, Jason P.},\n  date = {2016},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {133},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {26858290},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {601--609},\n  issn = {15244539},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017719},\n  abstract = {Competing risks occur frequently in the analysis of survival data. A competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. In a study examining time to death attributable to cardiovascular causes, death attributable to noncardiovascular causes is a competing risk. When estimating the crude incidence of outcomes, analysts should use the cumulative incidence function, rather than the complement of the Kaplan-Meier survival function. The use of the Kaplan-Meier survival function results in estimates of incidence that are biased upward, regardless of whether the competing events are independent of one another. When fitting regression models in the presence of competing risks, researchers can choose from 2 different families of models: modeling the effect of covariates on the cause-specific hazard of the outcome or modeling the effect of covariates on the cumulative incidence function. The former allows one to estimate the effect of the covariates on the rate of occurrence of the outcome in those subjects who are currently event free. The latter allows one to estimate the effect of covariates on the absolute risk of the outcome over time. The former family of models may be better suited for addressing etiologic questions, whereas the latter model may be better suited for estimating a patient's clinical prognosis. We illustrate the application of these methods by examining cause-specific mortality in patients hospitalized with heart failure.

To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·80 (SD 0·03) compared with 0·67 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·69 (0·04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·74 (0·03) compared with 0·60 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·64 (0·03) for SDNN (p{$<$}0·0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p{$<$}0·0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke produce immense health and economic burdens in the United States and globally. The Update also presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease [CHD], heart failure [HF], valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs).

From January to July 2017 alone, the 2017 Statistical Update was accessed {$>$}106 500 times. Each annual version of the Statistical Update undergoes revisions to include the newest nationally representative data, add additional relevant published scientific findings, remove older information, add new sections or chapters, and increase the number of ways to access and use the assembled information. This year-long process, which begins as soon as the previous Statistical Update is published, is performed by the AHA Statistics Committee faculty volunteers and staff and government agency partners. This year's edition includes new data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, new metrics to assess and monitor healthy diets, new information on stroke in young adults, an enhanced focus on underserved and minority populations, a substantively expanded focus on the global burden of CVD, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals.

In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},\n  isbn = {0009-7322 (Print)},\n  keywords = {acute mental,cells,increases in cardiovascular variables,like,lymphocytes,rapid and transient,stress is accompanied by,studies have shown that,w m f any},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Z5ESW4KD/1994 - Benschop et al. - Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on immunologic and cardiovascular changes induced by mental stress.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967093,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":265},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1009,"entry":"@article{Berkman2003,\n  title = {Effects of {{Treating Depression}} and {{Low Perceived Social Support}} on {{Clinical Events}} after {{Myocardial Infarction}}: {{The Enhancing Recovery}} in {{Coronary Heart Disease Patients}} ({{ENRICHD}}) {{Randomized Trial}}},\n  author = {Berkman, Lisa F. and Blumenthal, James and Burg, Matthew and Carney, Robert M. and Catellier, Diane and Cowan, Marie J. and Czajkowski, Susan M. and De Busk, Robert and Hosking, James and Jaffe, Allan and Kaufmann, Peter G. and Mitchell, Pamela and Norman, James and Powell, Lynda H. and Raczynski, James M. and Schneiderman, Neil and {Raczynski}},\n  date = {2003-06-18},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American Medical Association},\n  volume = {289},\n  number = {23},\n  pages = {3106--3116},\n  publisher = {{American Medical Association}},\n  issn = {00987484},\n  doi = {10.1001/jama.289.23.3106},\n  abstract = {Context: Depression and low perceived social support (LPSS) after myocardial infarction (MI) are associated with higher morbidity and mortality, but little is known about whether this excess risk can be reduced through treatment.

Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted from October 1996 to April 2001 in 2481 MI patients (1084 women, 1397 men) enrolled from 8 clinical centers. Major or minor depression was diagnosed by modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and severity by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); LPSS was determined by the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) Social Support Instrument (ESSI). Random allocation was to usual medical care or CBT-based psychosocial intervention. Intervention: Cognitive behavior therapy was initiated at a median of 17 days after the index MI for a median of 11 individual sessions throughout 6 months, plus group therapy when feasible, with SSRIs for patients scoring higher than 24 on the HRSD or having a less than 50\\% reduction in Beck Depression Inventory scores after 5 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Composite primary end point of death or recurrent MI; secondary outcomes included change in HRSD (for depression) or ESSI scores (for LPSS) at 6 months. Results: Improvement in psychosocial outcomes at 6 months favored treatment: mean (SD) change in HRSD score, -10.1 (7.8) in the depression and psychosocial intervention group vs -8.4 (7.7) in the depression and usual care group (P{$<$}.001); mean (SD) change in ESSI score, 5.1 (5.9) in the LPSS and psychosocial intervention group vs 3.4 (6.0) in the LPSS and usual care group (P{$<$}.001).

AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy.

Further research is necessary to verify and establish reasons for these racial differences.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967114,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":268},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1051,"entry":"@article{Boscarino2008,\n  title = {A Prospective Study of Ptsd and Early-Age Heart Disease Mortality among Vietnam Veterans: {{Implications}} for Surveillance and Prevention},\n  author = {Boscarino, Joseph A},\n  date = {2008-07},\n  journaltitle = {Psychosomatic Medicine},\n  volume = {70},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {18596248},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {668--676},\n  issn = {00333174},\n  doi = {10.1097/PSY.0b013e31817bccaf},\n  url = {https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-200807000-00007},\n  urldate = {2018-10-27},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively early-age heart disease (HD) among a national random sample of 4328 male Vietnam veterans, who did not have HD at baseline in 1985.

However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20\\% increase in mortality risk (all p {$<$} .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline.

Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7\\% = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only.

Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p {$<$}.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p {$<$}.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.},\n  isbn = {0000000000000},\n  keywords = {Cardiovascular disease,depressive disorders,done,PTSD,stress},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/UEUFN7KH/2018 - Bremner et al. - Brain Correlates of Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967141,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":272},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1405,"entry":"@article{Bressler2010,\n  title = {Genetic Variants Identified in a {{European}} Genome-Wide Association Study That Were Found to Predict Incident Coronary Heart Disease in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study},\n  author = {Bressler, Jan and Folsom, Aaron R. and Couper, David J. and Volcik, Kelly A. and Boerwinkle, Eric},\n  date = {2010-01-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Epidemiology},\n  volume = {171},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {19955471},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {14--23},\n  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},\n  issn = {00029262},\n  doi = {10.1093/aje/kwp377},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/aje/kwp377},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {In 2007, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) performed a genome-wide association study in 2,000 British coronary heart disease (CHD) cases and 3,000 controls after genotyping 469,557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Seven variants associated with CHD were initially identified, and 5 SNPs were later found in replication studies. In the current study, the authors aimed to determine whether the 12 SNPs reported by the WTCCC predicted incident CHD through 2004 in a biracial, prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) comprising 15,792 persons aged 45-64 years who had been selected by probability sampling from 4 different US communities in 1987-1989. Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age and gender were used to estimate CHD hazard rate ratios (HRRs) over a 17-year period (1,362 cases in whites and 397 cases in African Americans) under an additive genetic model. The results showed that 3 SNPs in whites (rs599839, rs1333049, and rs501120; HRRs were 1.10 (P = 0.044), 1.14 (P {$<$} 0.001), and 1.14 (P = 0.030), respectively) and 1 SNP in African Americans (rs7250581; HRR = 1.60, P = 0.05) were significantly associated with incident CHD.

Method: A national sample of adults (N = 949) aged 34-84 rated their relationships with spouse, family, and friends at 2 time points 10 years apart. At the second time point, participants completed a biological protocol in which indices of autonomic, hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal axis, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic function were obtained and used to create an AL summary score. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations among 3 aspects of social relationships-social support, social negativity, and frequency of social contact-and AL. Results: Higher levels of spouse negativity, family negativity, friend contact, and network level contact were each associated with higher AL, and higher levels of spouse support were associated with lower AL, independent of age, sociodemographic factors, and health covariates. Tests for age interactions suggested that friend support and network support were each associated with higher AL among older adults, but at younger ages there appeared to be no association between friend support and AL and a negative association between network support and AL. For network negativity, there was a marginal interaction such that network negativity was associated with higher AL among younger adults but there was no association among older adults. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that structural and functional aspects of the social environment are associated with AL, and extend previous work by demonstrating that these associations vary based on the type of relationship assessed and by age.},\n  keywords = {Aging,Allostatic load,Relationships,Social negativity,Social support},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/TSIPJCCQ/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967153,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":274},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2065,"entry":"@article{Bun2015,\n  title = {Atrial Flutter: More than Just One of a Kind},\n  author = {Bun, Sok-Sithikun and Latcu, Decebal Gabriel and Marchlinski, Francis and Saoudi, Nadir},\n  date = {2015-09-14},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {36},\n  number = {35},\n  pages = {2356--2363},\n  publisher = {{Eur Heart J}},\n  issn = {0195-668X},\n  doi = {10.1093/eurheartj/ehv118},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv118},\n  urldate = {2022-11-22},\n  abstract = {Since its first description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial flutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved.

GREM2 expression follows cardiac lineage differentiation independently of the differentiation method used, or the origin of the pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that GREM2 is linked to cardiogenesis. Addition of GREM2 protein strongly increases cardiomyocyte output compared to established procardiogenic differentiation methods. Our data show that inhibition of canonical BMP signaling by GREM2 is necessary to promote proliferation of CPCs. However, canonical BMP signaling inhibition alone is not sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation, which depends on subsequent JNK pathway activation specifically by GREM2.

The traditional tool of epidemiological ‘risk factor analysis’ is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model.},\n  isbn = {0300-5771 (Print)\\textbackslash r0300-5771},\n  keywords = {Data correlation,Regression models,Statistics,Twin studies},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/4DKXIVU8/2005_Carlin et al._Regression models for twin studies A critical review.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967202,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":281},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1731,"entry":"@article{Carnevali2018,\n  title = {Autonomic and Brain Morphological Predictors of Stress Resilience},\n  author = {Carnevali, Luca and Koenig, Julian and Sgoifo, Andrea and Ottaviani, Cristina},\n  date = {2018-04-06},\n  journaltitle = {Frontiers in Neuroscience},\n  volume = {12},\n  pages = {228},\n  publisher = {{Frontiers Media S.A.}},\n  issn = {1662453X},\n  doi = {10.3389/fnins.2018.00228},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC5897537/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-11-05},\n  abstract = {Stressful life events are an important cause of psychopathology. Humans exposed to aversive or stressful experiences show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in their responses. However, the majority does not develop stress-related psychiatric disorders. The dynamic processes encompassing positive and functional adaptation in the face of significant adversity have been broadly defined as resilience. Traditionally, the assessment of resilience has been confined to self-report measures, both within the general community and putative high-risk populations. Although this approach has value, it is highly susceptible to subjective bias and may not capture the dynamic nature of resilience, as underlying construct. Recognizing the obvious benefits of more objective measures of resilience, research in the field has just started investigating the predictive value of several potential biological markers. This review provides an overview of theoretical views and empirical evidence suggesting that individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of resting cardiac vagal outflow, may underlie different levels of resilience toward the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Following this line of thought, recent studies describing associations between regional brain morphometric characteristics and resting state vagally-mediated HRV are summarized. Existing studies suggest that the structural morphology of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), particularly its cortical thickness, is implicated in the expression of individual differences in HRV. These findings are discussed in light of emerging structural neuroimaging research, linking morphological characteristics of the ACC to psychological traits ascribed to a high-resilient profile and abnormal structural integrity of the ACC to the psychophysiological expression of stress-related mental health consequences. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach integrating brain structural imaging with HRV monitoring could offer novel perspectives about brain-body pathways in resilience and adaptation to psychological stress.},\n  issue = {APR},\n  keywords = {Anterior cingulate cortex,Cortical thickness,Depression,Heart rate variability,PTSD,Resilience,Stress},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/4LSVFX9P/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967207,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":282},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":752,"entry":"@report{Carney,\n  title = {Low Heart Rate Variability and the Effect of Depression on Post-Myocardial Infarction Mortality},\n  author = {Carney, Robert M. and Blumenthal, James A. and Freedland, Kenneth E. and Stein, Phyllis K. and Howells, William B. and Berkman, Lisa F. and Watkins, Lana L. and Czajkowski, Susan M. and Hayano, Junichiro and Domitrovich, Peter P. and Jaffe, Allan S.},\n  date = {2005},\n  journaltitle = {Archives of Internal Medicine},\n  volume = {165},\n  number = {13},\n  eprint = {16009863},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1486--1491},\n  issn = {00039926},\n  doi = {10.1001/archinte.165.13.1486},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. RESULTS: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{$<$}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1\\%) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{$<$}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95\\% CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95\\% CI, 0.23-0.31; P{$<$}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.},\n  isbn = {0003-9926 (Print)\\textbackslash r0003-9926},\n  keywords = {adult,aged,Ambulatory,article,Circadian Rhythm,clinical trial,comparative study,complications,confidence interval,controlled clinical trial,controlled study,death,depression,Depression,electrocardiography,Electrocardiography,epidemiology,female,Female,follow up,Follow-Up Studies,hazard assessment,heart infarction,Heart Rate,heart rate variability,human,Humans,ischemic heart disease,major clinical study,male,Male,Middle Aged,mortality,Myocardial Infarction,physiology,physiopathology,priority journal,Proportional Hazards Models,Retrospective Studies,risk assessment,risk factor,Risk Factors,Severity of Illness Index,survival,Survival Rate,United States}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967217,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":283},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":847,"entry":"@report{Carney1988,\n  title = {The Relationship between Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability and Depression in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease},\n  author = {Carney, Robert M. and Rich, Michael W. and TeVelde, Adriaantje and Saini, Jasbir and Clark, Karen and Freedland, Kenneth E.},\n  date = {1988},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Psychosomatic Research},\n  volume = {32},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {3404497},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {159--164},\n  issn = {00223999},\n  doi = {10.1016/0022-3999(88)90050-5},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=3404497},\n  abstract = {Seventy-seven patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization were administered a diagnostic psychiatric interview and their mean heart rates and heart rate variability were determined from the results of a 24 hr ambulatory ECG.

It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease.

Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95\\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95\\% CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients.

The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up.

Although standards antidepressants are more effective than placebo, up to 35\\% of patients do not respond to 4 or more conventional treatments and are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Considerable effort has been devoted to trying to find effective treatments for TRD. This review focuses on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), approved for TRD in 2005 by the Food and Drugs Administration. Stimulation is carried by bipolar electrodes on the left cervical vagus nerve, which are attached to an implanted stimulator generator. The vagus bundle contains about 80\\% of afferent fibers terminating in the medulla, from which there are projections to many areas of brain, including the limbic forebrain. Various types of brain imaging studies reveal widespread functional effects in brain after either acute or chronic VNS. Although more randomized control trials of VNS need to be carried out before a definitive conclusion can be reached about its efficacy, the results of open studies, carried out over period of 1 to 2 years, show much more efficacy when compared with results from treatment as usual studies. There is an increase in clinical response to VNS between 3 and 12 months, which is quite different from that seen with standard antidepressant treatment of MDD. Preclinically, VNS affects many of the same brain areas, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) and signal transduction mechanisms (brain-derived neurotrophic factor–tropomyosin receptor kinase B) as those found with traditional antidepressants. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which VNS benefits patients nonresponsive to conventional antidepressants is unclear, with further research needed to clarify this.},\n  keywords = {BDNF-TrkB,Monoamines,TRD,VNS}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967282,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":295},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":939,"entry":"@article{Carter2015,\n  title = {Sympathoneural and Adrenomedullary Responses to Mental Stress},\n  author = {Carter, Jason R and Goldstein, David S},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  journaltitle = {Comprehensive Physiology},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {25589266},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {119--146},\n  publisher = {{NIH Public Access}},\n  issn = {20404603},\n  doi = {10.1002/cphy.c140030},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589266},\n  urldate = {2019-08-23},\n  abstract = {This concept-based review provides historical perspectives and updates about sympathetic noradrenergic and sympathetic adrenergic responses to mental stress.

This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.},\n  keywords = {Acute mental stress,Heart Rate Variability,Systematic review with meta-analysis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3QG2AVAA/2015_Castaldo et al._Acute mental stress assessment via short term HRV analysis in healthy adults A systematic review with meta-analysis.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967290,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":297},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1945,"entry":"@online{CentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention2018,\n  title = {Underlying {{Cause}} of {{Death}}, 1999-2017 {{Results Form}}},\n  author = {{Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}},\n  date = {2018},\n  url = {https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76;jsessionid=BDCCDF1C86BC2DCE59ACB4091FF6#Citation},\n  urldate = {2022-06-09},\n  abstract = {Underlying Cause of Death 1999-2017 on CDC WONDER Online Database, released December, 2018.

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in candidate genes in ethnic minority probands with early-onset AF and determine genotype-phenotype associations. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort, family-based study, probands of African and Hispanic descent with early-onset AF (defined as AF occurring in individuals aged ≤66 years) prospectively enrolled in a clinical and genetic biorepository underwent sequencing of 60 candidate genes. Recruitment took place from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 1 to February 28, 2020. Exposures: Rare and novel variants categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in African American and Hispanic/Latinx probands with early-onset AF and genotype-phenotype associations. Results: Among 227 probands with early-onset AF, mean (SD) age at onset of AF was 51.0 (9.9) years, 132 probands (58.1\\%) were men, 148 (65.2\\%) were African American, and 79 (34.8\\%) were Hispanic/Latinx. A family history of AF was verified in 24 probands with early-onset AF (10.6\\%). Sequencing 60 candidate genes identified 53 (23 rare and 30 novel) variants with 16 of the 227 (7.0\\%) probands harboring likely pathogenic (43.8\\%) or pathogenic (56.2\\%) variants, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin (46.7\\%). In 6 families with more than 2 affected members, variants of unknown significance in sodium channel (SCN10A), potassium channel (KCNE5), sarcomeric proteins (MYH6 and TTN), and atrial natriuretic peptide (NPPA) cosegregated with AF. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants were identified, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, that increase susceptibility to early-onset AF in African American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals.

In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors.

Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms. OBJECTIVE To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease risk assessment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.},\n  keywords = {cardiovascular diseases,coronary calcium score,framingham risk calculator,risk assessment,united states preventive services task force},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/MNSEHIBL/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967336,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":305},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1765,"entry":"@article{DavidGoldberg1996,\n  title = {Ischemic, Hemodynamic, and Neurohormonal Responses to Mental and Exercise Stress: {{Experience}} from the {{Psychophysiological Investigations}} of {{Myocardial Ischemia}} Study ({{PIMI}})},\n  author = {David Goldberg, A. and Becker, Lewis C. and Bonsall, Robert and Cohen, Jerome D. and Ketterer, Mark W. and Kaufman, Peter G. and Krantz, David S. and Light, Kathleen C. and McMahon, Robert P. and Noreuil, Todd and Pepine, Carl J. and Raczynski, James and Stone, Peter H. and Dawn Strother, R.

Methods and Results: The Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study (PIMI) evaluated the physiological and neuroendocrine functioning in unmedicated patients with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ischemia. Hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to bicycle exercise, public speaking, and the Stroop test were measured by radionuclide ventriculography, ECG, and blood pressure and catecholamine monitoring. With mental stress, there were increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance that were correlated with increases in plasma epinephrine. During exercise, systemic vascular resistance fell, and there was no relationship between the hemodynamic changes and epinephrine levels. The fall in ejection fraction was greater with mental stress than exercise. During mental stress, the changes in election fraction were inversely correlated with the changes in systemic vascular resistance. Evidence for myocardial ischemia was present in 92\\% of patients during bicycle exercise and in 58\\% of patients during mental stress. Greater increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine occurred with ischemia during exercise, and greater increases in systemic vascular resistance occurred with ischemia during mental stress. Conclusions: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance and a relatively minor increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product compared with ischemia induced by exercise. These hemodynamic responses to mental stress can be mediated by the adrenal secretion of epinephrine. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved are important in the understanding of the etiology of myocardial ischemia and perhaps in the selection of appropriate anti-ischemic therapy.},\n  keywords = {catecholamines,exercise,hemodynamics,ischemia,mental,stress}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967347,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":306},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":748,"entry":"@article{Davydov2007,\n  title = {Baroreflex Mechanisms in Major Depression},\n  author = {Davydov, Dmitry M. and Shapiro, David and Cook, Ian A. and Goldstein, Iris},\n  date = {2007},\n  journaltitle = {Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry},\n  volume = {31},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {17011098},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {164--177},\n  issn = {02785846},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.08.015},\n  abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, in the following selective review, we attempt to reconcile sometimes-divergent evidence of the role of CAR in the pathway to depression. We first examine association of CAR with psychological factors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to develop depression. Then, we summarize the findings regarding the CAR profile in those with current depression, and evaluate evidence for the role of CAR following depression resolution and continued vulnerability. Finally, we showcase longitudinal studies showing the role of CAR in predicting depression onset and recurrence. Overall, the studies reveal an important, but complex, association between CAR and vulnerability to depression.},\n  keywords = {Daily hassles,Environmental factors,Genetic influence,HPA axis,MDD,SCN},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ZA3JC2FJ/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967358,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":308},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2195,"entry":"@article{Dekker1997,\n  title = {Heart {{Rate Variability}} from {{Short Electrocardiographic Recordings Predicts Mortality}} from {{All Causes}} in {{Middle-aged}} and {{Elderly Men}}: {{The Zutphen Study}}},\n  author = {Dekker, J.

However, up-to-date trends in disease burden and regional variation remain unknown. In an observational study utilizing the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, age-standardized mortality and incidence rates for AF overall and for each state in the United States (US) from 1990 to 2017 were determined. All analyses were stratified by gender. The relative change in age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized death rate (ASDR) over the observation period were determined. Trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression analysis. The mean ASIR per 100,000 population for men was 92 (+/-8) and for women was 62 (+/-5) in the US in 2017. The mean ASDR per 100,000 population for men was 5.8 (+/-0.3) and for women was 4.4 (+/-0.4). There were progressive increases in ASIR and ASDR in all but 1 state. The states with the greatest percentage change in incidence were New Hampshire (+13.5\\%) and Idaho (+16.0\\%) for men and women, respectively. The greatest change regarding mortality was seen in Mississippi (+26.3\\%) for men and Oregon (+53.8\\%) for women. In conclusion these findings provide updated evidence of increasing AF and/or AFL incidence and mortality on a national and regional level in the US, with women experiencing greater increases in incidence and mortality rates. This study demonstrates that the public health burden related to AF in the United States is progressively worsening but disproportionately across states and among women.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/JLVZ4K98/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967365,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":310},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1067,"entry":"@article{Denollet2010,\n  title = {Anger, {{Suppressed Anger}}, and {{Risk}} of {{Adverse Events}} in {{Patients With Coronary Artery Disease}}},\n  author = {Denollet, Johan and Gidron, Yori and Vrints, Christiaan J. and Conraads, Viviane M.},\n  date = {2010-06-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Cardiology},\n  volume = {105},\n  number = {11},\n  pages = {1555--1560},\n  issn = {00029149},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.01.015},\n  abstract = {Anger is associated with cardiovascular stress reactivity; however, little is known about the effect of suppressed anger in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We examined whether patients with CAD who suppress their anger are at risk of adverse events. At baseline, 644 patients with CAD completed measures of anger, anger-in (reluctance to express anger), and Type D personality (tendency to experience distress and to be inhibited). The combination of high anger and anger-in scores was used to identify the presence of suppressed anger. The end points were major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. After an average follow-up of 6.3 years (range 5 to 10), 126 patients (20\\%) had experienced a major adverse cardiac event, and 59 (9\\%) had experienced cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Anger (p = 0.009) and suppressed anger (p = 0.011) were associated with future major adverse cardiac events, but these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, suppressed anger remained associated with the more rigorous end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.87, 95\\% confidence interval 1.15 to 7.15, p = 0.024) after controlling for decreased systolic function, poor exercise tolerance, extent of CAD, and revascularization. Anger alone was not independently associated with this end point. Patients with a Type D personality had a fourfold rate of suppressed anger, and an adjustment for a Type D personality attenuated the observed association between suppressed anger and adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, patients with CAD who suppress their anger were at increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and this was accounted for by individual differences in Type D personality. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of exercise-associated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) during and after exercise testing. Methods: We studied 1847 heart failure-free patients who underwent clinical treadmill testing between March 13, 1997, and January 15, 2004, in the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the clinical and exercise test associations of exercise and recovery PVCs. Propensity score-adjusted Cox survival analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of exercise-associated PVCs. Results: Of the 1847 subjects, 850 (46.0\\%) developed exercise PVCs (median rate, 0.43 per minute) and 620 (33.6\\%) had recovery PVCs (median rate, 0.60 per minute). Resting PVCs, age, and systolic blood pressure were key predictors of both exercise and recovery PVCs. Whereas exercise PVCs were related to the heart rate increase with exercise, recovery PVCs were related to coronary disease (previous myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or pathological Q waves on resting electrocardiogram) and ST-segment depression. During a 5.4-year mean follow-up, 161 subjects (8.7\\%) died, and 53 of these deaths (32.9\\%) were due to cardiovascular causes.

For each core feature, we first provide a brief overview of its relevance to depression and neurobiological underpinnings, and then review evidence investigating a potential role of inflammation. We focus primarily on findings from experimental paradigms of exogenously-induced inflammation. We conclude that inflammation likely plays a role in exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward reactivity, and somatic symptoms.

Maternal and infant cortisol levels were sampled at baseline, reactivity, and recovery and mother's and infant's cardiac vagal tone were measured during the free play, still-face, and reunion episodes of the procedure. Cortisol reactivity was higher among infants in the SF condition and while cortisol decreased at recovery for infants in the SF+T, it further increased for those in the SF. Vagal tone showed a greater suppression when SF was not accompanied by maternal touch. Touch synchrony during free play was associated with higher infant vagal tone, whereas touch myssynchrony - maternal tactile stimulation while the infant gaze averts - correlated with higher maternal and infant cortisol.

There are few data concerning depression as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12\\%. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95\\% CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95\\% CI, 1.1-4.0). CONCLUSION: Clinical depression appears to be an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease for several decades after the onset of the clinical depression.},\n  isbn = {0003-9926},\n  keywords = {cardiovascular diseases,coronary heart disease risk,depressive disorders,endogenous depression},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/MTUU5L6G/1998 - Ford et al. - Depression is a risk factor for coronary artery disease in men The precursors study.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967401,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":318},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2077,"entry":"@article{Foy2018,\n  title = {Relation of {{Obesity}} to {{New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation}} and {{Atrial Flutter}} in {{Adults}}},\n  author = {Foy, Andrew J and Mandrola, John and Liu, Guodong and Naccarelli, Gerald V},\n  date = {2018},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Cardiology},\n  volume = {121},\n  number = {9},\n  eprint = {29501206},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1072--1075},\n  issn = {18791913},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019},\n  urldate = {2022-11-22},\n  abstract = {Prospective cohort studies involving older adults report an association of obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

The primary end point of new-onset atrial fibrillation was compared between obese and nonobese cohorts. We used logistic regression to determine the strength of association between obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes. Overall, 67,278 subjects were included in the cohort, divided evenly between those with and without a diagnosis of obesity. Obese subjects were significantly more likely to have hypertension (29.5\\% vs 14.6\\%) and diabetes (12.7\\% vs 5.2\\%) at study onset. Over 8 years of follow-up, we recorded a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in 1,511 (2.2\\%) subjects. Obesity was strongly associated with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation after controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes (odds ratio 1.4, 95\\% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.6). In conclusion, this information contributes to the growing evidence supporting the causal relation between obesity and atrial fibrillation, and emphasizes the need of addressing obesity as part of our therapeutic strategy to prevent atrial fibrillation.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/YMNQG3N3/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967405,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":319},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1084,"entry":"@article{Friedrich2017b,\n  title = {Depression {{Is}} the {{Leading Cause}} of {{Disability Around}} the {{World}}},\n  author = {Friedrich, M.

However, no published evidence exists that antidepressant drugs are safe or efficacious in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001. PATIENTS: A total of 369 patients with MDD (64\\% male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74\\%; unstable angina, 26\\%). INTERVENTION: After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD. RESULTS: Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54\\% [10\\%]; week 16, 54\\% [11\\%]; placebo: baseline, 52\\% [13\\%]; week 16, 53\\% [13\\%]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) runs (sertraline: 13.1\\%; placebo: 12.9\\%), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at end point (sertraline: 12\\%; placebo: 13\\%), or other cardiac measures.

Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.},\n  isbn = {0003-990X},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VL8DYBLL/2007 - Glassman et al. - Heart rate variability in acute coronary syndrome patients with major depression influence of sertraline and mo.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967440,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":326},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1763,"entry":"@article{Goldberg2002,\n  title = {The {{Vietnam}} Era Twin Registry},\n  author = {Goldberg, Jack and Curran, Birute and Vitek, Mary Ellen and Henderson, William G. and Boyko, Edward J.},\n  date = {2002-10-01},\n  journaltitle = {Twin Research},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {12537880},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {476--481},\n  publisher = {{Twin Res}},\n  issn = {13690523},\n  doi = {10.1375/136905202320906318},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12537880/},\n  urldate = {2021-03-07},\n  abstract = {The Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry is composed of 7369 middle-aged male-male twin pairs both of whom served in the military during the time of the Vietnam conflict (1965-1975), The Registry is a United States Department of Veterans Affairs resource that was originally constructed from military records; the Registry has been in existence for more than 15 years.

Patients underwent 1-hour Holter testing, with immediate HRV analysis using the HeartTrends DyDx algorithm, followed by exercise stress echocardiography (n=612) or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (n=431). The threshold for low HRV was identified using receiver operating characteristic analysis based on sensitivity and specificity. The primary end point was the presence of myocardial ischemia detected by exercise stress echocardiography or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The mean age of patients was 61 years and 38\\% were women. Myocardial ischemia was detected in 66 (6.3\\%) patients. After adjustment for CAD risk factors and exercise stress testing results, low HRV was independently associated with a significant 2-fold increased likelihood for myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.00; 95\\% CI, 1.41-2.89 [P=0.01]). Adding HRV to traditional CAD risk factors significantly improved the pretest probability for myocardial ischemia. Conclusions Our data from a large prospective international clinical study show that short-term HRV testing can be used as a novel digital-health modality for enhanced risk assessment in low- to intermediate-risk individuals without known CAD.

BACKGROUND: Although atrial flutter can now be cured, there are no reports on its epidemiology in unselected patients. METHODS: The Marshfield Epidemiological Study Area (MESA), a database that captures nearly all medical care among its 58,820 residents was used to ascertain all new cases of atrial flutter diagnosed from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1995. To identify predisposing risk factors, we employed an age- and gender-matched case-control study design using eight additional variables. RESULTS: A total of 181 new cases of atrial flutter were diagnosed for an overall incidence of 88/100,000 person-years. Incidence rates ranged from 5/100,000 in those {$<$}50 years old to 587/100,000 in subjects older than 80. Atrial flutter was 2.5 times more common in men (p {$<$} 0.001). The risk of developing atrial flutter increased 3.5 times (p {$<$} 0.001) in subjects with heart failure and 1.9 times (p {$<$} 0.001) for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among those with atrial flutter 16\\% were attributable to heart failure and 12\\% to chronic obstructive lung disease. Three subjects (1.7\\%) without identifiable predisposing risks were labeled as having 'lone atrial flutter.' CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first population-based investigation of atrial flutter, suggests this curable condition is much more common than previously appreciated. If our findings were applicable to the entire U.S. population, we estimate 200,000 new cases of atrial flutter in this country annually. At highest risk of developing atrial flutter are men, the elderly and individuals with preexisting heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease.

The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions.

METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22\\% (±23\\%) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9\\% (-10.5\\%, -2.6\\%) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5\\% (8.1\\%, 91.3\\%), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1\\% [-10.9\\%, 8.2\\%], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.},\n  keywords = {Endothelial function,Epicardial,Flow,Mental stress,Microvascular,Resistance},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WS2IYSED/2018 - Hammadah et al. - Coronary and peripheral vasomotor responses to mental stress.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967516,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":338},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1007,"entry":"@article{Hare2014,\n  title = {Depression and Cardiovascular Disease: {{A}} Clinical Review},\n  author = {Hare, David L and Toukhsati, Samia R and Johansson, Peter and Jaarsma, Tiny},\n  date = {2014-06-01},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {35},\n  number = {21},\n  eprint = {24282187},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1365--1372},\n  issn = {15229645},\n  doi = {10.1093/eurheartj/eht462},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282187},\n  urldate = {2019-10-19},\n  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression are common. Patients with CVD have more depression than the general population. Persons with depression are more likely to eventually develop CVD and also have a higher mortality rate than the general population. Patients with CVD, who are also depressed, have a worse outcome than those patients who are not depressed. There is a graded relationship: the more severe the depression, the higher the subsequent risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events. It is possible that depression is only a marker for more severe CVD which so far cannot be detected using our currently available investigations. However, given the increased prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, a causal relationship with either CVD causing more depression or depression causing more CVD and a worse prognosis for CVD is probable. There are many possible pathogenetic mechanisms that have been described, which are plausible and that might well be important. However, whether or not there is a causal relationship, depression is the main driver of quality of life and requires prevention, detection, and management in its own right. Depression after an acute cardiac event is commonly an adjustment disorder than can improve spontaneously with comprehensive cardiac management. Additional management strategies for depressed cardiac patients include cardiac rehabilitation and exercise programmes, general support, cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressant medication, combined approaches, and probably disease management programmes. © The Author 2013.},\n  keywords = {Cardiovascular disease,Depression,Management,Prognosis,Quality of life,Screening}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967521,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":339},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2050,"entry":"@article{Heinze2001,\n  title = {A Solution to the Problem of Monotone Likelihood in {{Cox}} Regression},\n  author = {Heinze, Georg and Schemper, Michael},\n  date = {2001},\n  journaltitle = {Biometrics},\n  volume = {57},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {11252585},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {114--119},\n  issn = {0006341X},\n  doi = {10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00114.x},\n  abstract = {The phenomenon of monotone likelihood is observed in the fitting process of a Cox model if the likelihood converges to a finite value while at least once parameter estimate diverges to ±∞.

This procedure produces finite parameter estimates by means of penalized maximum likelihood estimation.

In particular, the membrane scaffolding protein BIN1 functions to initiate T-tubule genesis in skeletal muscle cells. Constitutive knockdown of BIN1 in mice is perinatal lethal, which is associated with an induced dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the functional role of BIN1 in cardiomyocytes is not known. An important function of cardiac T-tubules is to allow L-type calcium channels (Cav1.2) to be in close proximity to sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors to initiate the intracellular calcium transient. Efficient excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and normal cardiac contractility depend upon Cav1.2 localization to T-tubules. We hypothesized that BIN1 not only exists at cardiac T-tubules, but it also localizes Cav1.2 to these membrane structures. We report that BIN1 localizes to cardiac T-tubules and clusters there with Cav1.2. Studies involve freshly acquired human and mouse adult cardiomyocytes using complementary immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy with dual immunogold labeling, and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we use surface biotinylation and live cell confocal and total internal fluorescence microscopy imaging in cardiomyocytes and cell lines to explore delivery of Cav1.2 to BIN1 structures. We find visually and quantitatively that dynamic microtubules are tethered to membrane scaffolded by BIN1, allowing targeted delivery of Cav1.2 from the microtubules to the associated membrane. Since Cav1.2 delivery to BIN1 occurs in reductionist non-myocyte cell lines, we find that other myocyte-specific structures are not essential and there is an intrinsic relationship between microtubule-based Cav1.2 delivery and its BIN1 scaffold. In differentiated mouse cardiomyocytes, knockdown of BIN1 reduces surface Cav1.2 and delays development of the calcium transient, indicating that Cav1.2 targeting to BIN1 is functionally important to cardiac calcium signaling. We have identified that membrane-associated BIN1 not only induces membrane curvature but can direct specific antegrade delivery of microtubule-transported membrane proteins. Furthermore, this paradigm provides a microtubule and BIN1-dependent mechanism of Cav1.2 delivery to T-tubules. This novel Cav1.2 trafficking pathway should serve as an important regulatory aspect of EC coupling, affecting cardiac contractility in mammalian hearts.},\n  isbn = {10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/D93USNMU/2010 - Hong et al. - BIN1 localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967535,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":342},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1734,"entry":"@article{Hopp2013,\n  title = {High Cardiac Vagal Control Protects against Future Depressive Symptoms under Conditions of High Social Support},\n  author = {Hopp, Henrik and Shallcross, Amanda J. and Ford, Brett Q. and Troy, Allison S. and Wilhelm, Frank H. and Mauss, Iris B.},\n  date = {2013-04},\n  journaltitle = {Biological Psychology},\n  volume = {93},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {23352570},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {143--149},\n  publisher = {{NIH Public Access}},\n  issn = {03010511},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.01.004},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC3622765/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-11-05},\n  abstract = {High cardiac vagal control (as measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) is associated with lower depression. Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association. This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA. To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults. Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms. Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms. Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support. The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement. These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes.

The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established. T-wave amplitude and QT-interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were obtained from an ECG measured in a type II axis configuration. Results: Compared to controls, persons with depression or anxiety disorders did not show a significantly different TWA (p = 0.58; Cohen's d = 0.046) or QTc (p = 0.48; Cohen's d = -0.057). In spite of known sympathomimetic effects, TCA use (p = 0.26; Cohen's d = -0.162) and SNRI use (p = 0.70; Cohen's d = -0.055) were not significantly associated with a lower TWA.

Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized β coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95\\%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models (β coefficients ranging from −0.14 to −0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with β coefficients ranging from 0.05 to −0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.},\n  keywords = {depressive disorders,dysautonomia,heart rate variability,twins,veterans},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/KEU6WK7Y/2018 - Huang et al. - Association of Depressive Symptoms and Heart Rate Variability in Vietnam War–Era Twins(2).pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967559,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":345},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":756,"entry":"@article{Hughes2008,\n  title = {Depressive Symptoms Predict Heart Rate Recovery after Exercise Treadmill Testing in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease: {{Results}} from the Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study},\n  author = {Hughes, Joel W. and York, Kaki M. and Li, Qin and Freedland, Kenneth E. and Carney, Robert M. and Sheps, David S.},\n  date = {2008},\n  journaltitle = {Psychosomatic Medicine},\n  volume = {70},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {18434491},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {456--460},\n  issn = {15347796},\n  doi = {10.1097/PSY.0b013e31816fcab3},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function.

METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50\\% blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5\\% of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p {$<$} .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery.

Lower HRV parameter values were significant predictors of higher mortality across different ages, sex, continents, populations and recording lengths.

As such, standardized screening pathways for depression in patients with CVD offer the potential for early identification and optimal management of depression to improve health outcomes.

The clinical outcomes associated with heart failure are considerably worse for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes mellitus. In people with diabetes mellitus, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, has led to the descriptive terminology, diabetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy is increasing in parallel with the increase in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is initially characterized by myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and associated diastolic dysfunction, later by systolic dysfunction, and eventually by clinical heart failure. Impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevations in advanced glycation end products and collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities have all been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Molecular mechanisms linked to the underlying pathophysiological changes include abnormalities in AMP-Activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-Activated receptors, O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine, protein kinase C, microRNA, and exosome pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a contemporary view of these instigators of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as mechanistically based strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.},\n  keywords = {Cardiac,Diabetes mellitus,Heart failure,Myocytes,Proxisome proliferator-Activated receptors,Renin-Angiotensin system},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Y9FHGHUP/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967592,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":351},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":713,"entry":"@article{Jørgensen2015,\n  title = {Heart Rate Variability Density Analysis ({{Dyx}}) for Identification of Appropriate Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Recipients among Elderly Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction},\n  author = {Jørgensen, Rikke Mørch and Levitan, Jacob and Halevi, Zohar and Puzanov, Natalia and Abildstrøm, Steen Zabell and Messier, Marc D. and Huikuri, Heikki V. and Haarbo, Jens and Thomsen, Poul Erik Bloch and Jons, Christian},\n  date = {2015},\n  journaltitle = {Europace},\n  volume = {17},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {25755288},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1848--1854},\n  issn = {15322092},\n  doi = {10.1093/europace/euu394},\n  abstract = {AIMS: Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) density analysis specifically designed to identify patients at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction ≤40\\% after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24\\%) had a Dyx ≤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age {$>$}70 years and QRS {$>$} 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

Bayesian multivariate analysis revealed a greater relevance of galanin system genes in highly stressed subjects compared with subjects with moderate or low life stress. Using the same method, the effect of the galanin system genes was stronger than the effect of the well-studied 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). Conventional multivariate analysis using general linear models demonstrated that interaction of galanin system genes with life stressors explained more variance (1.7\\%, P = 0.005) than the life stress-only model. This effect replicated in independent analysis of the Manchester and Budapest subpopulations, and in males and females. The results suggest that the galanin pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in humans by increasing the vulnerability to early and recent psychosocial stress. Correcting abnormal galanin function in depression could prove to be a novel target for drug development.

Comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic data were collected and patients were followed annually, carefully documenting clinical outcomes, recurrence of paroxysmal AF, and progression to CAF. Baseline clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic variables were evaluated by univariate Cox proportionate hazards analysis. A stepwise approach was used to model the association between echocardiographic and clinical variables with progression to CAF. Results A total of 757 patients with a baseline diagnosis of paroxysmal AF were evaluated. Median follow-up was 8.0 years (range 2 days to 11.1 years). The probability of progression to CAF by 1 year was 8.6\\% and thereafter there was a slow but steady progression to 24.7\\% by 5 years. By 5 years, the probability of documented recurrence of any AF (chronic or paroxysmal) was 63.2\\%. Increasing age, significant aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, and diagnosis of cardiomyopathy were independently associated with progression to CAF. A more rapid heart rate during AF was associated with decreased risk of progression. Conclusions After the initial diagnosis of paroxysmal AF, there is a slow but steady progression to CAF.

Methods We estimated HR (bpm), standard deviation of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (SDNN, ms), and root mean squared difference in successive, normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (RMSSD, ms) from resting, standard 12-lead ECGs. We estimated associations between each phenotype and 17 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accounting for relatedness and adjusting for age, sex, study site, and ancestry. Cohort-specific estimates were combined using fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analysis. We investigated replication for select SNPs exceeding genome-wide (P {$<$}5 × 10–8) or suggestive (P {$<$}10–6) significance thresholds.

However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 ± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3\\%]), 100\\% completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9\\%) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6\\%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95\\% CI, 0.49-0.96;P = .03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8\\% vs 24.5\\% (HR, 0.82; 95\\% CI, 0.51-1.33;P = .43), for cardiac death, 10.7\\% vs 13.2\\% (HR, 0.79; 95\\% CI, 0.41-1.52;P = .48); for MI, 8.7\\% vs 15.2\\% (HR, 0.54; 95\\% CI, 0.27-0.96;P = .04), and for PCI, 12.8\\% vs 19.9\\% (HR, 0.58; 95\\% CI, 0.33-1.04;P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.

During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Methods Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether excessive digital vasoconstriction during acute mental stress predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred forty-nine patients with stable coronary artery disease (age 63±9, 76\\% male, 29\\% black) underwent mental stress testing with a standardized public speaking stressor and followed prospectively for cardiovascular end points. Digital pulse wave amplitude was continuously measured using peripheral artery tonometry (PAT, Itamar Inc). Stress/rest PAT ratio (sPAT) of pulse wave amplitude during mental stress/baseline was calculated and dichotomized by the median value into low and high sPAT ratio groups. Upon 3-year follow-up, Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard ratios were used to examine the association between sPAT ratio and the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and hospitalization for heart failure. The median sPAT ratio was 0.68 (interquartile range, 0.48-0.88), indicating 32\\% vasoconstriction with mental stress. Men were more likely to have low sPAT ratio than women (odds ratio, 1.79; P=0.007) while those on β-blockers were less likely to have low sPAT ratio (odds ratio, 0.52; P=0.003). After adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and rate-pressure product change during mental stress, those with low sPAT ratio were at significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.77 [95\\% CI, 1.12-2.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Greater peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, denoted by a low sPAT ratio, is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.},\n  keywords = {coronary artery disease,myocardial infarction,stress,vasoconstriction},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/EWX8U3MP/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967838,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":361},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2196,"entry":"@article{Kiviniemi2007,\n  title = {Endurance Training Guided Individually by Daily Heart Rate Variability Measurements},\n  author = {Kiviniemi, Antti M. and Hautala, Arto J. and Kinnunen, Hannu and Tulppo, Mikko P.},\n  date = {2007-10-10},\n  journaltitle = {European Journal of Applied Physiology},\n  volume = {101},\n  number = {6},\n  pages = {743--751},\n  issn = {1439-6319},\n  doi = {10.1007/s00421-007-0552-2}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967841,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":362},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1019,"entry":"@article{Ko2017,\n  title = {Cohort Profile: {{The Emory Cardiovascular Biobank}} ({{EmCAB}})},\n  author = {Ko, Yi An and Hayek, Salim and Sandesara, Pratik and Samman Tahhan, Ayman and Quyyumi, Arshed},\n  date = {2017},\n  journaltitle = {BMJ Open},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {29288185},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {e018753},\n  publisher = {{BMJ Publishing Group}},\n  issn = {20446055},\n  doi = {10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018753},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29288185},\n  urldate = {2019-02-03},\n  abstract = {A series of calcineurin-inhibiting compds. consisting of a central arom.

The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002–2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 ± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as “Psychological distress”; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results “Psychological distress” was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95\\% CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, “Psychological distress” mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: −7.1, 95\\% CI: −9.7, −4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.},\n  isbn = {2047-4873},\n  keywords = {Anxiety,Cardiovascular disease,CVD risk factors,Depression,Mediation,Psychological distress}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967858,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":364},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2054,"entry":"@article{Kornej2020,\n  title = {Epidemiology of {{Atrial Fibrillation}} in the 21st {{Century}}: {{Novel Methods}} and {{New Insights}}.},\n  author = {Kornej, Jelena and Börschel, Christin S and Benjamin, Emelia J and Schnabel, Renate B},\n  date = {2020-06-19},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation research},\n  volume = {127},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {32716709},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {4--20},\n  publisher = {{Lippincott Williams and Wilkins}},\n  issn = {1524-4571},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316340},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716709},\n  abstract = {Accompanying the aging of populations worldwide, and increased survival with chronic diseases, the incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) are rising, justifying the term global epidemic.

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as \"0\" (not at all) to \"3\" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$>$} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88\\% and a specificity of 88\\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967880,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":367},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1037,"entry":"@article{Kronish2019,\n  title = {Effect of {{Depression Screening}} after {{Acute Coronary Syndromes}} on {{Quality}} of {{Life}}: {{The CODIACS-QoL Randomized Clinical Trial}}},\n  author = {Kronish, Ian M. and Moise, Nathalie and Cheung, Ying Kuen and Clarke, Gregory N. and Dolor, Rowena J. and Duer-Hefele, Joan and Margolis, Karen L. and St Onge, Tara and Parsons, Faith and Retuerto, Jessica and Thanataveerat, Anusorn and Davidson, Karina W.},\n  date = {2019},\n  journaltitle = {JAMA Internal Medicine},\n  publisher = {{American Medical Association}},\n  issn = {21686106},\n  doi = {10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.4518},\n  abstract = {Importance: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated depressive symptoms are at increased risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality, worse quality of life, and higher health care costs. These observational findings prompted multiple scientific panels to advise universal depression screening in survivors of ACS prior to evidence from randomized screening trials. Objective: To determine whether systematically screening for depression in survivors of ACS improves quality of life and depression compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-group multisite randomized trial enrolled 1500 patients with ACS from 4 health care systems between November 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, with follow-up ending July 31, 2018. Patients were eligible if they had been hospitalized for ACS in the previous 2 to 12 months and had no prior history of depression. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: Patients with ACS were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive (1) systematic depression screening using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with notification of primary care clinicians and provision of centralized, patient-preference, stepped depression care for those with positive screening results (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10; screen, notify, and treat, n = 499); (2) systematic depression screening, with notification of primary care clinicians for those with positive screening results (screen and notify, n = 501); and (3) usual care (no screening, n = 500). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in quality-adjusted life-years. The secondary outcome was depression-free days. Adverse effects and mortality were assessed by patient interview and hospital records. Results: A total of 1500 patients (424 women and 1076 men; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [11.5] years) were randomized in the 18-month trial. Only 71 of 1000 eligible survivors of ACS (7.1\\%) had elevated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores indicating depressive symptoms at screening. There were no differences in mean (SD) change in quality-adjusted life-years (screen, notify and treat, -0.06 [0.20]; screen and notify, -0.06 [0.20]; no screen, -0.06 [0.18]; P =.98) or cumulative mean (SD) depression-free days (screen, notify and treat, 343.1 [179.0] days; screen and notify, 351.3 [175.0] days; no screen, 339.0 [176.6] days; P =.63). Harms including death, bleeding, or sleep difficulties did not differ among groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with ACS without a history of depression, systematic depression screening with or without providing depression treatment did not alter quality-adjusted life-years, depression-free days, or harms.

HRV (5-minute resting baseline vs. 5-minute meditation) was collected from 36 participants before and after they completed a 10-day intensive Vipassana retreat. Changes in three frequency-domain measures of HRV were analysed using 2 (Time; pre- vs. post-Vipassana). ×. 2 (Task; resting baseline vs. meditation) within subjects ANOVA. These measures were: normalised high-frequency power (HF n.u.), a widely used biomarker of parasympathetic activity; log-transformed high frequency power (ln HF), a measure of RSA and required to interpret normalised HF; and Traube-Hering-Mayer waves (THM), a component of the low frequency spectrum linked to baroreflex outflow. As expected, participants showed significantly increased well-being, and decreased ill-being. ln HF increased overall during meditation compared to resting baseline, while there was a time. *. task interaction for THM. Further testing revealed that pre-Vipassana only ln HF increased during meditation (vs. resting baseline), consistent with a change in respiration. Post-Vipassana, the meditation task increased HF n.u. and decreased THM compared to resting baseline, suggesting post-Vipassana task-related changes are characterised by a decrease in absolute LF power, not parasympathetic-mediated increases in HF power. Such baroreflex changes are classically associated with attentional load, and our results are interpreted in light of the concept of 'flow' - a state of positive and full immersion in an activity. These results are also consistent with changes in normalised HRV reported in other meditation studies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},\n  keywords = {Heart rate variability,Meditation,Mindfulness,Respiratory sinus arrhythmia,Traube-Hering-Mayer waves,Vipassana,Well-being},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GUBZU8H2/1-s2.0-S0167876013001888-main.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967895,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":369},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1985,"entry":"@article{Kupper2015,\n  title = {Cardiovascular Reactivity to Mental Stress and Mortality in Patients with Heart Failure},\n  author = {Kupper, Nina and Denollet, Johan and Widdershoven, Jos and Kop, Willem J.},\n  date = {2015-05-01},\n  journaltitle = {JACC: Heart Failure},\n  volume = {3},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {25951757},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {373--382},\n  publisher = {{American College of Cardiology FoundationWashington, D.C.}},\n  issn = {22131779},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016},\n  url = {https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016},\n  urldate = {2022-07-27},\n  abstract = {Objectives: This study examined whether blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to acute mental stress were associated with mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Background: HF is characterized by reduced contractility and impaired BP reactivity. Compared to exercise-induced physiological changes, the effects of mental stress on BP and heart rate in HF are not well understood. Methods: Patients with systolic HF (N= 100, 26\\% female, mean 65 ± 12 years of age) underwent a structured public speech task, during which BP and heart rate were recorded. Stress-induced BP and heart rate reactivity were categorized as high ({$>$}75\\%), intermediate (25\\% to 75\\%), or low ({$<$}25\\%). Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to examine the predictive value of cardiovascular stress responses for mortality (median follow-up= 48.5 months), adjusting for age, implanted devices, and baseline BP and heart rate levels. Results: At follow-up, 31 patients had died (31\\%). Mortality rates were 2 times higher (hazard ratio [HR]:2.04; 95\\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 3.60; p= 0.014) among patients with the lowest diastolic BP responses (mean=-2.4 ± 5.4mmHg) to mental stress than among those patients with an intermediate diastolic BP response (mean= 7.3 ± 2.5mmHg), adjusting for covariates. High diastolic BP reactivity (mean= 16.3 ± 3.4 mmHg) was not related to mortality (HR: 0.95; 95\\% CI: 0.55 to 1.66). Systolic BP responses showed a similar but nonsignificant association. Multivariate analyses showed that a high heart rate response ({$>$}6.3 beats/min) to acute mental stress was associated with a reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.40; 95\\% CI: 0.16 to 1.00; p= 0.051) compared to patients with intermediate responses. Conclusions: Low diastolic BP reactivity to mental stress is independently associated with all-cause mortality inpatients with HF.

Design A population-based, health and nutrition prospective survey. Methods In the context of the ATTICA Study (2002-2012), 853 adult participants without previous CVD history (453 men (45+/-13 years) and 400 women (44+/-18 years)) underwent psychological evaluations through validated, self-reporting depression and anxiety questionnaires. Results After adjustment for multiple established CVD risk factors, both reported depression and anxiety levels were positively and independently associated with the 10-year CVD incidence, with depression markedly increasing the CVD risk by approximately fourfold (adjusted odds ratio (95\\% confidence interval) 3.6 (1.3, 11) for depression status; 1.03 (1.0, 1.1) for anxiety levels).

Background: Anger can precipitate spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and induce TWA. Whether anger-induced TWA predicts future arrhythmias is unknown. Methods: Sixty-two patients with ICDs underwent ambulatory electrocardiography during a mental stress protocol, 3 months after the ICD was implanted. T-wave alternans was analyzed using time-domain methods. After a ≥1 year follow-up, ICD stored data was reviewed to determine incidence of ICD-terminated ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. Results: Patients with ICD-terminated arrhythmias during follow-up (n = 10) had higher TWA induced by anger, 13.2 μV (interquartile range [IQR] 9.3 to 16 μV), compared with those patients without future ventricular arrhythmias, 9.3 μV (IQR 7.5 to 11.5 μV, p {$<$} 0.01). Patients in the highest quartile of anger-induced TWA ({$>$}11.9 μV, n = 15) were more likely to experience arrhythmias by 1 year than those in the lower quartiles (33\\% vs. 4\\%) and during extended follow-up (40\\% vs. 9\\%, p {$<$} 0.01 for both). In multivariable regression controlling for ejection fraction, prior clinical arrhythmia, and wide QRS, anger-induced TWA remained a significant predictor of arrhythmia, with likelihood in the top quartile 10.8 times that of other patients (95\\% confidence interval: 1.6 to 113, p {$<$} 0.05).

Methods and Results - A multivariate survival model for the identification of sudden (presumably arrhythmic) death was developed with data from 202 consecutive patients referred between 1991 and 1995 with moderate to severe CHF (age 52±9 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 24±7\\%, New York Heart Association class 2.3±0.7; the derivation sample). Time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters obtained from an 8′ recording of ECG at baseline and during controlled breathing (12 to 15 breaths/min) were challenged against clinical and functional parameters. This model was then validated in 242 consecutive patients referred between 1996 and 2001 (validation sample). In the derivation sample, sudden death was independently predicted by a model that included low-frequency power (LFP) of HRV during controlled breathing ≤13 ms2 and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ≥77 mm (relative risk [RR] 3.7, 95\\% CI 1.5 to 9.3, and RR 2.6, 95\\% CI 1.0 to 6.3, respectively). The derivation model was also a significant predictor in the validation sample (P=0.04). In the validation sample, LFP ≤11 ms2 during controlled breathing and ≥83 ventricular premature contractions per hour on Holter monitoring were both independent predictors of sudden death (RR 3.0, 95\\% CI 1.2 to 7.6, and RR 3.7, 95\\% CI 1.5 to 9.0, respectively). Conclusions - Reduced short-term LFP during controlled breathing is a powerful predictor of sudden death in patients with CHF that is independent of many other variables.

We examined the association between HRV and incident CHD and non-CHD mortality in a cohort of 11,654 men and women aged 45–64 years at intake, from the biracial, population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Supine, resting, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected at the baseline examination. High frequency (HF; 0.15–0.40 Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) spectral powers, LF/HF ratio, normalized HF and LF, the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN), and the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (MSSD) were used as the conventional indexes of HRV to measure cardiac autonomic control. From this cohort, 635 cases of incident CHD (including 346 cases of incident myocardial infarction [MI] and 82 cases of fatal CHD), and 623 non-CHD deaths were identified and validated after an average of 8 years of follow-up. Among individuals with diabetes, the multivariable adjusted proportional hazards ratios (95\\% CI) were 2.03 (1.28–3.23), 1.60 (1.12–2.27), 1.50 (0.65–3.42), and 1.27 (0.84–1.91) for incident MI, incident CHD, fatal CHD, and non-CHD deaths, respectively, comparing the lowest quartile to the upper most three quartiles of HF. A similar pattern of associations was found for LF, SDNN, and MSSD. By contrast, there was no consistent pattern of associations among individuals without diabetes. At the population level, a lower HRV (reflective of impaired cardiac autonomic control) is statistically significantly related to the development of CHD among individuals with diabetes, independent of markers of the duration/severity of the glucose metabolism impairment.

The purpose of this scientific statement is to review available evidence and recommend whether depression should be elevated to the status of a risk factor for patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS - : Writing group members were approved by the American Heart Association's Scientific Statement and Manuscript Oversight Committees. A systematic literature review on depression and adverse medical outcomes after acute coronary syndrome was conducted that included all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and composite outcomes for mortality and nonfatal events. The review assessed the strength, consistency, independence, and generalizability of the published studies. A total of 53 individual studies (32 reported on associations with all-cause mortality, 12 on cardiac mortality, and 22 on composite outcomes) and 4 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of the demographic composition of study samples, definition and measurement of depression, length of follow-up, and covariates included in the multivariable models. Despite limitations in some individual studies, our review identified generally consistent associations between depression and adverse outcomes.

Objective To determine the association between mental stress-induced impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation as assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation and adverse cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital network between June 2011 and August 2014. A cohort of individuals with stable coronary artery disease were included. Data analysis took place from November 2018 to May 2019. Exposures Study participants were subjected to a laboratory mental stress task (public speaking). Main Outcomes and Measures Flow-mediated vasodilation was measured before and 30 minutes after a public-speaking mental stress task. We examined the association of the rest (prestress), poststress, and δ flow-mediated vasodilation (poststress minus prestress levels) with an adjudicated composite end point of adverse events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina leading to revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, medical history, and depression. Results A total of 569 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [9.3] years; 420 men [73.8\\%]). Flow-mediated vasodilation decreased from a mean (SD) of 4.8\\% (3.7\\%) before mental stress to 3.9\\% (3.6\\%) after mental stress (a 23\\% reduction; P {$<$} .001), and 360 participants (63.3\\%) developed transient endothelial dysfunction (a decrease in flow-mediated vasodilation). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 3.0 (2.9-3.1) years, 74 patients experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event. The presence of transient endothelial dysfunction with mental stress was associated with a 78\\% increase (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.78 [95\\% CI, 1.15-2.76]) in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular event. Both the δ flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.15 [95\\% CI, 1.03-1.27] for each 1\\% decline) and poststress flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.14 [95\\% CI, 1.04-1.24] for each 1\\% decline) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular event.

Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535967971,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":382},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1054,"entry":"@article{Magruder2016,\n  title = {Long-{{Term Trajectories}} of {{PTSD}} in {{Vietnam-Era Veterans}}: {{The Course}} and {{Consequences}} of {{PTSD}} in {{Twins}}},\n  author = {Magruder, Kathryn M. and Goldberg, Jack and Forsberg, Christopher W. and Friedman, Matthew J. and Litz, Brett T. and Vaccarino, Viola and Heagerty, Patrick J. and Gleason, Theresa C. and Huang, Grant D. and Smith, Nicholas L.},\n  date = {2016-02},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Traumatic Stress},\n  volume = {29},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {20419729},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {5--16},\n  issn = {15736598},\n  doi = {10.1002/jts.22075},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26764215},\n  urldate = {2018-11-25},\n  abstract = {What do we know about resilience in crime victimization?

Results: AF and AFL patients were significantly more likely to be daily alcohol drinkers (27\\% vs 14\\% of controls, P = 0.001).

Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient β-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and β-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p {$<$} 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p {$<$} 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p {$<$} 0.01).

It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure contributes to the risk for development of PTSD. OBJECTIVE To examine whether HRV before combat deployment is associated with increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment when accounting for deployment-related combat exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between July 14, 2008, and May 24, 2012, active-duty Marines were assessed 1 to 2 months before a combat deployment and again 4 to 6 months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Participants in the second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to April 16, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predeployment HRVwas measured via finger photoplethysmography during a 5-minute period of rest. Frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. Diagnosis of PTSD was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. RESULTS After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, lower HRV before deployment as measured by an increased low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) ratio of HRV was associated with risk of PTSD diagnosis after deployment (combined MRS-I and MRS-II cohortmeta-analysis odds ratio, 1.47; 95\\%CI, 1.10-1.98; P = .01).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This prospective longitudinal study provides initial and modest evidence that an altered state of autonomic nervous system functioning contributes to PTSD vulnerability, taking into account other key risk factors. If these findings are replicated, interventions that change autonomic nervous system function may open novel opportunities for prevention and treatment of PTSD.},\n  keywords = {2003-2011,Adam X Maihofer,Adult,Afghan Campaign 2001-,Arpi Minassian,Cohort Studies,doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0922,Extramural,Heart Rate / physiology*,Humans,Iraq War,Logistic Models,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Marine Resiliency Study Team,MEDLINE,Military Personnel / psychology*,Multivariate Analysis,N.I.H.,National Center for Biotechnology Information,National Institutes of Health,National Library of Medicine,NCBI,NIH,NLM,Non-P.H.S.,Photoplethysmography,pmid:26353072,Post-Traumatic / epidemiology*,Prevalence,Prospective Studies,PubMed Abstract,Research Support,Risk,Stress Disorders,U.S. Gov't,Young Adult},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/39W958F8/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968031,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":389},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1059,"entry":"@article{Mittleman1995,\n  title = {Triggering of Acute Myocardial Infarction Onset by Episodes of Anger},\n  author = {Mittleman, Murray A and Maclure, Malcolm and Sherwood, Jane B and Mulry, Richard P and Tofler, Geoffrey H and Jacobs, Sue C and Friedman, Richard and Benson, Herbert and Muller, James E},\n  date = {1995-10-01},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {92},\n  number = {7},\n  eprint = {7671353},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1720--1725},\n  publisher = {{American Heart Association, Inc.}},\n  issn = {00097322},\n  doi = {10.1161/01.CIR.92.7.1720},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7671353},\n  urldate = {2018-05-31},\n  abstract = {Background Many anecdotes and several uncontrolled case series have suggested that emotionally stressful events, and more specifically, anger, immediately precede and appear to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction. However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95\\% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95\\% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95\\% confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P{$<$}.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.},\n  isbn = {0009-7322 (Print)\\textbackslash r0009-7322 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {anger,myocardial infarction}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968041,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":390},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1955,"entry":"@article{Moazzami2020,\n  title = {Higher {{Activation}} of the {{Rostromedial Prefrontal Cortex}} during {{Mental Stress Predicts Major Cardiovascular Disease Events}} in {{Individuals}} with {{Coronary Artery Disease}}},\n  author = {Moazzami, Kasra and Wittbrodt, Matthew T. and Lima, Bruno B. and Nye, Jonathon A. and Mehta, Puja K. and Pearce, Brad D. and Almuwaqqat, Zakaria and Hammadah, Muhammad and Levantsevych, Oleksiy and Sun, Yan V. and Raggi, Paolo and Garcia, Ernest V. and Goetz, Margarethe and Quyyumi, Arshed A. and Bremner, J.

Certain brain regions that control both emotional states and cardiac physiology may be involved in this relationship. The rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) is an important brain region that processes stress and regulates immune and autonomic functions. Changes in rmPFC activity with emotional stress (reactivity) may be informative of future risk for MACE. Methods: Participants with stable coronary artery disease underwent acute mental stress testing using a series of standardized speech/arithmetic stressors and simultaneous brain imaging with high-resolution positron emission tomography brain imaging. We defined high rmPFC activation as a difference between stress and control scans greater than the median value for the entire cohort. Interleukin-6 levels 90 minutes after stress, and high-frequency heart rate variability during stress were also assessed. We defined MACE as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. Results: We studied 148 subjects (69\\% male) with mean±SD age of 62±8 years. After adjustment for baseline demographics, risk factors, and baseline levels of interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability, higher rmPFC stress reactivity was independently associated with higher interleukin-6 and lower high-frequency heart rate variability with stress. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 34 subjects (21.3\\%) experienced a MACE. Each increase of 1 SD in rmPFC activation with mental stress was associated with a 21\\% increase risk of MACE (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95\\% CI, 1.08-1.37]). Stress-induced interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability explained 15.5\\% and 32.5\\% of the relationship between rmPFC reactivity and MACE, respectively. Addition of rmPFC reactivity to conventional risk factors improved risk reclassification for MACE prediction, and C-statistic improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P=0.03). Conclusions: Greater rmPFC stress reactivity is associated with incident MACE. Immune and autonomic responses to mental stress may play a contributory role.},\n  keywords = {coronary artery disease,heart rate,inflammation,prefrontal cortex,psychological,stress,treatment outcome},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/K3EPKVRI/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968048,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":391},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1042,"entry":"@article{Mostofsky2014,\n  title = {Outbursts of Anger as a Trigger of Acute Cardiovascular Events: {{A}} Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},\n  author = {Mostofsky, Elizabeth and Penner, Elizabeth Anne and Mittleman, Murray A},\n  date = {2014-06-01},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {35},\n  number = {21},\n  eprint = {24591550},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1404--1410},\n  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},\n  issn = {15229645},\n  doi = {10.1093/eurheartj/ehu033},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591550},\n  urldate = {2018-12-25},\n  abstract = {AIM: Short-term psychological stress is associated with an immediate physiological response and may be associated with a transiently higher risk of cardiovascular events.

To address monotone likelihood, previous studies have applied Firth's bias correction method to Cox regression models. However, while the model selection criteria for Firth's penalized partial likelihood approach have not yet been studied, a heuristic AIC-type information criterion can be used in a statistical package. Application of the heuristic information criterion to data obtained from a prospective observational study of patients with multiple brain metastases indicated that the heuristic information criterion selects models with many parameters and ignores the adequacy of the model. Moreover, we showed that the heuristic information criterion tends to select models with many regression parameters as the sample size increases. Thereby, in the present study, we propose an alternative AIC-type information criterion based on the risk function. A Bayesian information criterion type was also evaluated. Further, the presented simulation results confirm that the proposed criteria performed well in a monotone likelihood setting. The proposed AIC-type criterion was applied to prospective observational study data.

Comprehensive and standardised surveillance for non-communicable diseases was recommended at the United Nations High-level meeting in 2011. Aims: To develop a model surveillance system for CMDs and risk factors that could be adopted for continued assessment of burdens from multiple perspectives in South-Asian countries. Methods. Design: Hybrid model with two cross-sectional serial surveys three years apart to monitor trend, with a three-year prospective follow-up of the first cohort. Sites: Three urban settings (Chennai and New Delhi in India; Karachi in Pakistan), 4000 participants in each site stratified by gender and age. Sampling methodology: Multi-stage cluster random sampling; followed by within-household participant selection through a combination of Health Information National Trends Study (HINTS) and Kish methods. Culturally-appropriate and methodologically-relevant data collection instruments were developed to gather information on CMDs and their risk factors; quality of life, health-care utilisation and costs, along with objective measures of anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters. The cohort follow-up is designed as a pilot study to understand the feasibility of estimating incidence of risk factors, disease events, morbidity, and mortality. Results: The overall participant response rate in the first cross-sectional survey was 94.1\\% (Chennai 92.4\\%, n=4943; Delhi 95.7\\%, n=4425; Karachi 94.3\\%, n=4016). 51.8\\% of the participants were females, 61.6\\%{$<$}45years, 27.5\\% 45-60years and 10.9\\% {$>$}60years. Discussion. This surveillance model will generate data on prevalence and trends; help study the complex life-course patterns of CMDs, and provide a platform for developing and testing interventions and tools for prevention and control of CMDs in South-Asia. It will also help understanding the challenges and opportunities in establishing a surveillance system across countries. © 2012 Nair et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n  keywords = {Cardio-metabolic diseases,Risk-factors,South-Asia,Surveillance},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/I2CXKZPL/2012 - Nair et al. - CARRS Surveillance study Design and methods to assess burdens from multiple perspectives.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968066,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":394},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1413,"entry":"@article{Newton-Cheh2007a,\n  title = {Genome-Wide Association Study of Electrocardiographic and Heart Rate Variability Traits: {{The Framingham Heart Study}}},\n  author = {Newton-Cheh, Christopher and Guo, Chao Yu and Wang, Thomas J. and O, Donnell, Christopher J. and Levy, Daniel and Larson, Martin G.},\n  date = {2007-09-19},\n  journaltitle = {BMC Medical Genetics},\n  volume = {8},\n  eprint = {17903306},\n  eprinttype = {pubmed},\n  pages = {S7},\n  issn = {14712350},\n  doi = {10.1186/1471-2350-8-S1-S7},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17903306},\n  urldate = {2020-03-09},\n  abstract = {Background: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits. Methods: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52\\% women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51\\% women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10, call rate ≥ 80\\%, Hardy-Weinberg p-value ≥ 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN). Results: Associations at p {$<$} 10-3 were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values {$<$} 10-3; lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 × 10-4) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007. Conclusion: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population. © 2007 Newton-Cheh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},\n  issue = {SUPPL. 1},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/8G4CR3KS/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968072,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":395},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1450,"entry":"@article{Nievergelt2015,\n  title = {Genomic Predictors of Combat Stress Vulnerability and Resilience in {{U}}.{{S}}. {{Marines}}: {{A}} Genome-Wide Association Study across Multiple Ancestries Implicates {{PRTFDC1}} as a Potential {{PTSD}} Gene},\n  author = {Nievergelt, Caroline M. and Maihofer, Adam X. and Mustapic, Maja and Yurgil, Kate A. and Schork, Nicholas J. and Miller, Mark W. and Logue, Mark W. and Geyer, Mark A. and Risbrough, Victoria B. and O'Connor, Daniel T. and Baker, Dewleen G.},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  journaltitle = {Psychoneuroendocrinology},\n  volume = {51},\n  eprint = {25456346},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {459--471},\n  issn = {18733360},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.10.017},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25456346},\n  urldate = {2018-12-24},\n  abstract = {Background: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. Methods: Participants (. N=. 3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: The array produced {$>$}800K directly genotyped and {$>$}21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04×10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p{$<$}5×10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. Conclusions: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups.

Data Sources: In this meta-analysis, PubMed was searched from inception until December 31, 2020, for randomized clinical trials of interventions to treat or prevent coronary artery disease reporting mortality and nonfatal MI published in 3 leading journals. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials including at least 1000 patients with 24 months of follow-up. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Trial-level correlations between nonfatal MI and all-cause or CV mortality were assessed for surrogacy using the coefficient of determination (R2). The criterion for surrogacy was set at 0.8. Subgroup analyses based on study subject (primary prevention, secondary prevention, mixed primary and secondary prevention, and revascularization), era of trial (before 2000, 2000-2009, and 2010 and after), and follow-up duration (2.0-3.9, 4.0-5.9, and ≥6.0 years) were performed. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause or CV mortality and nonfatal MI. Results: A total of 144 articles randomizing 1211897 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Nonfatal MI did not meet the threshold for surrogacy for all-cause (R2= 0.02; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.08) or CV (R2= 0.11; 95\\% CI, 0.02-0.27) mortality. Nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality in primary (R2= 0.01; 95\\% CI, 0.001-0.26), secondary (R2= 0.03; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.20), mixed primary and secondary prevention (R2= 0.001; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.08), or revascularization trials (R2= 0.21; 95\\% CI, 0.002-0.50). For trials enrolling patients before 2000 (R2= 0.22; 95\\% CI, 0.08-0.36), between 2000 and 2009 (R2= 0.02; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.17), and from 2010 and after (R2= 0.01; 95\\% CI, 0.00-0.09), nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality.

Psychosocial factors have frequently been studied as risk factors for coronary heart disease but not for HF. Methods and Results-We examined the relationship between psychological status and incident HF among 6782 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Anger, anxiety, chronic stress, depressive symptoms, and hostility were measured using validated scales, and physician reviewers adjudicated incident HF events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for relevant demographic, behavioral, and physiological covariates. Interactions by age, race, sex, and self-reported health were examined in exploratory analyses. During a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, 242 participants developed incident HF. There was no association between psychosocial factors and HF hazard ratios (95\\% confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest quartile: anger=1.14 (0.81-1.60), anxiety=0.74 (0.51-1.07), chronic stress = 1.25 (0.90-1.72), depressive symptoms= 1.19 (0.76-1.85), and hostility = 0.95 (0.62-1.42). In exploratory analysis, among the participants reporting fair/poor health at baseline, those reporting high versus low levels of anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms had 2-fold higher risk of incident HF, but there was no association for those with good/very good/excellent self-reported health. Conclusions-Overall, these psychosocial factors were not significantly associated with incident HF. However, for participants reporting poor health at baseline, there was evidence that anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of HF.

Increased HR and reduced HR variability are markers of increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2002, 6814 men and women (2624 Whites, 1895 African-Americans, 1492 Hispanics, and 803 Chinese) aged 45 to 84 years took part in the first examination of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Associations of psychosocial variables with mean values of HR and its short-term variability were tested, using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: In age, gender, race/ethnicity, and risk factor-adjusted analyses, a depressive symptom score was positively associated with HR and inversely associated with HR variability (standard deviation of normal-to-normal (N-N) interbeat intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in N-N intervals (RMSSD)). The adjusted mean differences per 1-SD (8 points) increment of depression score for HR, RMSSD, and SDNN were 0.5 (95\\% confidence interval (CI), 0.2-0.7), -0.8 (95\\% CI, -1.5 to -0.2), and -0.7 (95\\% CI, -1.1 to -0.2). The social support score was inversely associated with HR, but nonsignificantly associated with RMSSD and SDNN. There was no association of trait anger or trait anxiety with HR, RMSSD, or SDNN. Associations were generally consistent in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings generally support the hypothesis that depression may be associated with increased HR and reduced HR variability, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15\\% had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85\\%), PPV (50\\%) and NPV (97\\%) as compared to standard EST (53\\%, 42\\%, 90\\%, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86\\% and 85\\%, respectively).

No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95\\% confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95\\% CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

In this situation, showing a relevant effect with an acceptable power requires the observation of a large number of patients over a long period of time. For feasibility issues, it is therefore often considered to include several event types of interest, non-fatal or fatal, and to combine them within a composite endpoint. Commonly, a composite endpoint is analyzed with standard survival analysis techniques by assessing the time to the first occurring event. This approach neglects that an individual may experience more than one event which leads to a loss of information. As an alternative, composite endpoints could be analyzed by models for recurrent events. There exists a number of such models, e.g. regression models based on count data or Cox-based models such as the approaches of Andersen and Gill, Prentice, Williams and Peterson or, Wei, Lin and Weissfeld. Although some of the methods were already compared within the literature there exists no systematic investigation for the special requirements regarding composite endpoints. Methods Within this work a simulation-based comparison of recurrent event models applied to composite endpoints is provided for different realistic clinical trial scenarios. Results We demonstrate that the Andersen-Gill model and the Prentice- Williams-Petersen models show similar results under various data scenarios whereas the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld model delivers effect estimators which can considerably deviate under commonly met data scenarios.

HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10–24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).},\n  isbn = {1872-7484 (Electronic) 1566-0702 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Anxiety,Autonomic nervous system,Depression,Heart rate variability,Young people}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968140,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":404},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1890,"entry":"@article{Parvez2012a,\n  title = {Symptomatic Response to Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy Is Modulated by a Common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in Atrial Fibrillation},\n  author = {Parvez, Babar and Vaglio, Joseph and Rowan, Shane and Muhammad, Raafia and Kucera, Gayle and Stubblefield, Tanya and Carter, Shannon and Roden, Dan and Darbar, Dawood},\n  date = {2012-08-07},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {60},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {22726630},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {539--545},\n  publisher = {{J Am Coll Cardiol}},\n  issn = {07351097},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2012.01.070},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726630/},\n  urldate = {2022-05-09},\n  abstract = {Objectives: This study tested the hypothesis that response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is modulated by 3 common loci associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 3 loci, on chromosomes 4q25 (near PITX2), 16q22 (in ZFHX3), and 1q21 (in KCNN3), that associate with either typical or lone AF. These findings indicate that variable mechanisms contribute to AF susceptibility, and suggest that response to therapy may be genotype dependent. Methods: We studied 478 and 198 Caucasian patients in the discovery cohort and validation cohort, respectively, who were prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry. Response was defined prospectively as successful rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months with {$<$}75\\% reduction in symptomatic AF burden. We also evaluated AF recurrence by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Symptomatic patients were also given a 24- to 48-h Holter monitor or 30-day event recorder when AF recurrence was not captured by 12-lead ECG.

Multiple clinical variables (including age, hypertension, lone AF) failed to significantly predict response to AADs; however, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10033464 at 4q25 was an independent predictor of successful rhythm control in patients with typical AF carrying the ancestral allele (wild type) versus carriers of variant allele (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7, 95\\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83 to 12, p = 0.0013. In the validation cohort, 143 (72\\%) patients met the criteria for successful rhythm control, and rs10033464 was again an independent predictor of successful rhythm control, OR: 1.5, 95\\% CI: 1.02 to 3.06, p = 0.04. This SNP (rs10033464) was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in the discovery (39\\% AF recurrence) and validation (38\\% AF recurrence) cohorts; OR: 3.27, 95\\% CI: 1.7 to 6, p {$<$} 0.001 and OR: 4.3, 95\\% CI: 1.98 to 9.4, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that a common SNP on chromosome 4q25 associated with AF modulates response to AAD therapy and points to a potential role for stratification of therapeutic approaches by genotype. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},\n  keywords = {antiarrhythmics,atrial fibrillation,genomics,polymorphisms},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/U24Q2JKC/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968148,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":405},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1687,"entry":"@article{Paur2012,\n  title = {High Levels of Circulating Epinephrine Trigger Apical Cardiodepression in a β 2-Adrenergic Receptor/{{Gi-dependent}} Manner: {{A}} New Model of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy},\n  author = {Paur, Helen and Wright, Peter T. and Sikkel, Markus B. and Tranter, Matthew H. and Mansfield, Catherine and O'Gara, Peter and Stuckey, Daniel J. and Nikolaev, Viacheslav O. and Diakonov, Ivan and Pannell, Laura and Gong, Haibin and Sun, Hong and Peters, Nicholas S. and Petrou, Mario and Zheng, Zhaolun and Gorelik, Julia and Lyon, Alexander R. and Harding, Sian E.},\n  date = {2012-08-07},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {126},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {22732314},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {697--706},\n  publisher = {{Europe PMC Funders}},\n  issn = {00097322},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.111591},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC4890655/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-09-20},\n  abstract = {Background-Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute heart failure syndrome characterized by myocardial hypocontractility from the mid left ventricle to the apex. It is precipitated by extreme stress and can be triggered by intravenous catecholamine administration, particularly epinephrine. Despite its grave presentation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rapidly reversible, with generally good prognosis. We hypothesized that this represents switching of epinephrine signaling through the pleiotropic β 2-adrenergic receptor (β 2AR) from canonical stimulatory G-protein-activated cardiostimulant to inhibitory G-protein-activated cardiodepressant pathways. Methods and Results-We describe an in vivo rat model in which a high intravenous epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, bolus produces the characteristic reversible apical depression of myocardial contraction coupled with basal hypercontractility. The effect is prevented via Gi inactivation by pertussis toxin pretreatment. β 2AR number and functional responses were greater in isolated apical cardiomyocytes than in basal cardiomyocytes, which confirmed the higher apical sensitivity and response to circulating epinephrine. In vitro studies demonstrated high-dose epinephrine can induce direct cardiomyocyte cardiodepression and cardioprotection in a β 2AR- Gi-dependent manner. Preventing epinephrine-Gi effects increased mortality in the Takotsubo model, whereas β-blockers that activate β 2AR- Gi exacerbated the epinephrine-dependent negative inotropic effects without further deaths. In contrast, levosimendan rescued the acute cardiac dysfunction without increased mortality. Conclusions-We suggest that biased agonism of epinephrine for β 2AR-Gs at low concentrations and for Gi at high concentrations underpins the acute apical cardiodepression observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with an apical-basal gradient in β 2ARs explaining the differential regional responses. We suggest this epinephrine-specific β 2AR-Gi signaling may have evolved as a cardioprotective strategy to limit catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity during acute stress. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.},\n  keywords = {acute heart failure,adrenergic,beta,catecholamines,receptors,Takotsubo syndrome},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/M4BJ654B/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968160,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":406},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2180,"entry":"@article{Pencina2011,\n  title = {Extensions of Net Reclassification Improvement Calculations to Measure Usefulness of New Biomarkers},\n  author = {Pencina, Michael J. and D'Agostino, Ralph B. and Steyerberg, Ewout W.},\n  date = {2011-01-15},\n  journaltitle = {Statistics in Medicine},\n  volume = {30},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {21204120},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {11--21},\n  issn = {02776715},\n  doi = {10.1002/sim.4085},\n  abstract = {Appropriate quantification of added usefulness offered by new markers included in risk prediction algorithms is a problem of active research and debate. Standard methods, including statistical significance and c statistic are useful but not sufficient. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) offers a simple intuitive way of quantifying improvement offered by new markers and has been gaining popularity among researchers. However, several aspects of the NRI have not been studied in sufficient detail.In this paper we propose a prospective formulation for the NRI which offers immediate application to survival and competing risk data as well as allows for easy weighting with observed or perceived costs. We address the issue of the number and choice of categories and their impact on NRI. We contrast category-based NRI with one which is category-free and conclude that NRIs cannot be compared across studies unless they are defined in the same manner. We discuss the impact of differing event rates when models are applied to different samples or definitions of events and durations of follow-up vary between studies. We also show how NRI can be applied to case-control data. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated in a Framingham Heart Study example.In conclusion, NRI can be readily calculated for survival, competing risk, and case-control data, is more objective and comparable across studies using the category-free version, and can include relative costs for classifications. We recommend that researchers clearly define and justify the choices they make when choosing NRI for their application.

Methods: We applied a machine learning framework using clinical features from the EHR in a multiethnic, clinical care cohort (BioMe) comprising 555 CAD cases and 6,349 control subjects and in a population-based cohort (UK Biobank) comprising 3,130 CAD cases and 378,344 control subjects for external validation.

Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia.

Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50\\% were female and 60\\% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95\\% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17\\% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95\\% CI: 1.00-1.38).

CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day.

Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37\\%) reported angina; 112 (12\\%) developed mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29\\%) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (19\\% vs 10\\%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95\\% confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11\\% vs 11\\%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.},\n  isbn = {0021-9258 (Print)\\textbackslash r0021-9258 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Angina,Cardiovascular disease,Ischemia,Sex differences}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968195,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":413},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1724,"entry":"@article{Pollitt2008,\n  title = {Cumulative Life Course and Adult Socioeconomic Status and Markers of Inflammation in Adulthood},\n  author = {Pollitt, R.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: 12 681 white and African-American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and two ancillary studies. Methods: Participants provided information on SES and place of residence in childhood and young (30-40 years) and mature (45+) adulthood. Residences were linked to census data for neighbourhood SES information. Multiple imputation (MI) was used for missing data. Linear regression and adjusted geometric means were used to estimate the effects of SES on inflammatory risk marker levels. Results: Graded, statistically significant associations were observed between greater cumulative life-course exposure to low education and social class and elevated levels of fibrinogen and WBC among white participants. Stronger graded, statistically significant associations were observed between low adult education, social class and neighbourhood SES and elevated inflammatory levels. Associations were weaker and less consistent in African-Americans. Covariate adjustment attenuated results but many associations remained strong. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cumulative exposure to adverse SES conditions across the life course and low adult SES are associated with an elevated systemic inflammatory burden in adulthood.

Overview B-splines constitute an appealing method for the nonparametric estimation of a range of statis-tical objects of interest. In this primer we focus our attention on the estimation of a conditional mean, i.e. the 'regression function'. A 'spline' is a function that is constructed piece-wise from polynomial functions. The term comes from the tool used by shipbuilders and drafters to construct smooth shapes having desired properties. Drafters have long made use of a bendable strip fixed in position at a number of points that relaxes to form a smooth curve passing through those points. The malleability of the spline material combined with the constraint of the control points would cause the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy required for bending it between the fixed points, this being the smoothest possible shape. We shall rely on a class of splines called 'B-splines' ('basis-splines'). A B-spline function is the maximally differentiable interpolative basis function. The B-spline is a generalization of the Bézier curve (a B-spline with no 'interior knots' is a Bézier curve). B-splines are defined by their 'order' m and number of interior 'knots' N (there are two 'endpoints' which are themselves knots so the total number of knots will be N +2). The degree of the B-spline polynomial will be the spline order m minus one (degree = m − 1). To best appreciate the nature of B-splines, we shall first consider a simple type of spline, the Bézier function, and then move on to the more flexible and powerful generalization, the B-spline itself. We begin with the univariate case in Section 2 where we consider the univariate Bézier function. In Section 3 we turn to the univariate B-spline function, and then in Section 4 we turn to the multivariate case where we also briefly mention how one could handle the presence of categorical predictors. We presume that interest lies in 'regression spline' methodology which differs in a number of ways from 'smoothing splines', both of which are popular in applied settings. The fundamen-tal difference between the two approaches is that smoothing splines explicitly penalize roughness and use the data points themselves as potential knots whereas regression splines place knots at equidistant/equiquantile points. We direct the interested reader to Wahba (1990) for a treatment of smoothing splines. Date: December 18, 2014. These notes are culled from a variety of sources.

Bézier curves We present an overview of Bézier curves which form the basis for the B-splines that follow. We begin with a simple illustration, that of a quadratic Bézier curve. Example 2.1. A quadratic Bézier curve. A quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced by the function B(x), given points β 0 , β 1 , and β 2 , where B(x) = β 0 (1 − x) 2 + 2β 1 (1 − x)x + β 2 x 2 = 2 i=0 β i B i (x), x ∈ [0, 1]. The terms B 0 (x) = (1 − x) 2 , B 1 (x) = 2(1 − x)x, and B 2 (x) = x 2 are the 'bases' which is this case turn out to be 'Bernstein polynomials' (Bernstein (1912)). For our purposes the 'control points' β i , i = 0, 1, 2, will be parameters that could be selected by least squares fitting in a regression setting, but more on that later.

Methods We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models. Results During mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30\\% women) developed flutter.

We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P {$<$} 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55±0.36 versus 0.76±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.},\n  keywords = {Coronary disease,Ischemia,Mental stress,Vasoconstriction},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ESKGTMI5/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968220,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":418},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1888,"entry":"@article{Ritchie2012,\n  title = {Chromosome 4q25 Variants Are Genetic Modifiers of Rare Ion Channel Mutations Associated with Familial Atrial Fibrillation},\n  author = {Ritchie, Marylyn D. and Rowan, Shane and Kucera, Gayle and Stubblefield, Tanya and Blair, Marcia and Carter, Shannon and Roden, Dan M. and Darbar, Dawood},\n  date = {2012-09-25},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {60},\n  number = {13},\n  eprint = {22818067},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1173--1181},\n  publisher = {{J Am Coll Cardiol}},\n  issn = {07351097},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2012.04.030},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22818067/},\n  urldate = {2022-05-09},\n  abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region that have been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) contribute to the variable penetrance of familial AF. Background: Although mutations in ion channels, gap junction proteins, and signaling molecules have been described for Mendelian forms of AF, penetrance is highly variable. Recent studies have consistently identified 2 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region as independent AF susceptibility alleles. Methods: Eleven families in which AF was present in {$<$}2 members who also shared a candidate gene mutation were studied. These mutations were identified in all subjects with familial lone AF (n = 33) as well as apparently unaffected family members (age {$>$}50 years with no AF; n = 17). Results: Mutations were identified in SCN5A (n = 6), NPPA (n = 2), KCNQ1 (n = 1), KCNA5 (n = 1), and NKX2.5 (n = 1). In genetic association analyses, unstratified and stratified according to age of onset of AF and unaffected age {$>$}50 years, there was a highly statistically significant association between the presence of both common (rs2200733 and rs10033464) and rare variants and AF (unstratified p = 1 × 10-8, stratified [age of onset {$<$}50 years and unaffected age {$>$}50 years] p = 7.6 × 10-5) (unstratified p {$<$} 0.0001, stratified [age of onset {$<$}50 years and unaffected age {$>$}50 years] p {$<$} 0.0001).

A single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2200733, is strongly associated with AF. We sought to characterize the association between rs2200733 and prevalent Afl and to determine if the variant could predict AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Methods and Results We performed a genetic association study of 295 patients with Afl and/or AF and 469 controls using multivariable logistic regression. The variant was then assessed as a predictor of incident AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in 87 consecutive typical Afl patients with Cox proportional hazards models. The rs2200733 rare allele was associated with an adjusted 2.06-fold increased odds of isolated Afl (95\\% CI: 1.13-3.76, P = 0.019) and an adjusted 2.79-fold increased odds of a combined phenotype of AF and Afl (95\\% CI: 1.81-4.28, P {$<$} 0.001). Following catheter ablation for Afl, carrier status of rs2200733 failed to predict an increased risk of AF either among all subjects (adjusted HR: 0.94; 95\\% CI: 0.58-1.53, P = 0.806) or among those with isolated Afl (adjusted HR: 1.29; 95\\% CI: 0.51-3.26, P = 0.585). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that Afl, whether occurring in isolation or along with AF, is associated with the rs2200733 AF risk allele.

Reportedly, non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) have a lower AF burden compared with their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. Information on the epidemiology of AF in Hispanic and Asian populations is much more limited. METHODS We excluded participants with a history of AF at enrollment. A total of 6721 MESA participants were monitored for the first AF event ascertained according to hospital discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) of AF were calculated per 1000 person-years of observation. IR ratios were calculated using NHWs as the reference group. Age- and sex-adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) of established modifiable AF risk factors were ascertained. RESULTS In the MESA cohort, 47.2\\% was male; at baseline, 25.7\\% had hypertension; 12.5\\% had diabetes. Three hundred five incident hospitalized AF events occurred over a mean follow-up of 7.3~years. Age- and sex-adjusted IRs and IR ratios showed that overall AF incidence was significantly lower among Hispanics, NHBs and Chinese compared with NHWs (all P~{$<~$}.001). Among participants 65~years of age or greater, Hispanics, Chinese, and blacks had significantly lower AF incidence than NHWs (all P~≤~.01), but IRs were similar among participants under age 65 years. The PAF for smoking was 27\\% among NHBs but lower among other race-ethnic groups. Among NHWs, the PAF for hypertension was 22.2\\%, but this was higher among NHBs (33.1\\%), Chinese (46.3\\%), and Hispanics (43.9\\%). CONCLUSIONS Overall, the incidence of hospitalized AF was significantly lower in Hispanics, NHBs, and Chinese than in NHWs. A larger proportion of AF events appear to be attributable to hypertension among nonwhite populations compared with NHWs.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968238,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":421},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1075,"entry":"@article{Rush2005b,\n  title = {Vagus Nerve Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression: {{A}} Randomized, Controlled Acute Phase Trial},\n  author = {Rush, A.

Diabetes-associated fibrosis is mediated by activated cardiac fibroblasts, but may also involve fibrogenic actions of macrophages, cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. The molecular basis responsible for cardiac fibrosis in diabetes remains poorly understood. Hyperglycemia directly activates a fibrogenic program, leading to accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that crosslink extracellular matrix proteins, and transduce fibrogenic signals through reactive oxygen species generation, or through activation of Receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-mediated pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may recruit fibrogenic leukocyte subsets in the cardiac interstitium. Activation of transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling may activate fibroblasts inducing deposition of structural extracellular matrix proteins and matricellular macromolecules.

For mobile applications, short term ECG measurement may be used for HRV analysis since the conventional five minute long recordings might be inadequately long. Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test. We validated these HRV features by showing significant differences in HRV features existed between the two stages.

The main goal of this study is to test the association between SNPs in CDH13 and CTNNA2 genes and ADHD across the life cycle in subjects with ADHD. This study included 1,136 unrelated ADHD cases and 946 individuals without ADHD.

Current national data trends for the incidence, stroke risk profiles, and mortality of hospitalization for NVAF and atrial flutter (AFL) are sparse. Methods: The Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was used to identify patients ≥ 20 years with incident NVAF/AFL (NVAF, ICD-9 code 427.3 or ICD-10 I48) in any diagnosis field from 2006 to 2015 in Canada, except Québec. National and provincial trends in rate over time (rate ratio, 95\\% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for age-sex standardized hospitalizations. Trends in stroke risk profiles and in-hospital mortality rates adjusted for stroke risk factors were also calculated. Results: A total of 578,947 patients were hospitalized with incident NVAF/AFL. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range: 68-84), 82\\% were ≥ 65 years, 54\\% were men, 54\\% had a CHADS2 ≥ 2, and 69\\% had a CHA2DS2-Vasc ≥ 3.

However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P {$<$} 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58\\% in patients versus 52\\% in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22\\% in patients versus 27\\% in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P {$<$} 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P {$<$} 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14\\% +/- 17\\%) than in healthy volunteers (29\\% +/- 14\\%) (P = 0.01).

Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices.

Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity.

An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49\\% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p{$<$}.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},\n  isbn = {1873-2402 (Electronic) 0006-3223 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,circadian,heart disease,heart rate variability,mental stress,military combat trauma,posttraumatic stress disorder},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7AC8X9GP/2013 - Shah et al. - Posttraumatic stress disorder and impaired autonomic modulation in male twins.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968296,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":434},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":786,"entry":"@article{Shah2014,\n  title = {Sex and Age Differences in the Association of Depression with Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease and Adverse Cardiovascular Events},\n  author = {Shah, Amit J. and Ghasemzadeh, Nima and Zaragoza-Macias, Elisa and Patel, Riyaz and Eapen, Danny J. and Neeland, Ian J. and Pimple, Pratik M. and Zafari, A.

Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged ≤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95\\% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years or women aged {$>$}55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged ≤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95\\% CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years and women aged {$>$}55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction.

The risk of cardiac events is increased during morning hours. Studying the contributions of autonomic mechanisms may yield insights into risk stratification and treatment. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction, measured by decreased heart rate variability (HRV), associates with abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of the association between abnormal myocardial stress perfusion with HRV using 276 middle-aged veteran twins without known ischemic heart disease. The primary independent variable was cardiac autonomic regulation measured with 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using linear and non-linear (multipole density, or Dyx) HRV metrics. The primary outcome was abnormal perfusion ({$>$}5\\% affected myocardium) during adenosine stress on [13N]-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 53 (3) years and 55 (20\\%) had abnormal perfusion. HRV (by Dyx) was reduced during morning hours in subjects with abnormal perfusion. At 7 AM, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in Dyx was associated a 4.8 (95\\% CI, 1.5 - 15.8) odds ratio (OR) for abnormal MPI. With Dyx {$<$} 2.0, the 7 AM OR for abnormal MPI was 11.8 (95\\% CI, 1.2 - 111.4). CONCLUSIONS Autonomic dysfunction, measured by non-linear HRV in the morning hours, was associated with an increased OR of abnormal MPI. These results suggest a potentially important role of ECG-based biomarkers in risk stratification for individuals with suspected ischemic heart disease.},\n  keywords = {★,Autonomic nervous system,Coronary artery disease,Heart rate variability,Myocardial perfusion,Positron emission tomography},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Z8SUYV9X/2020 - Shah et al. - Alterations in heart rate variability are associated with abnormal myocardial perfusion(2).pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968311,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":437},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1478,"entry":"@article{Shah2020a,\n  title = {Abstract {{P542}}: {{Association}} of {{Psychosocial Factors With Heart Rate Variability}}: {{The Atherosclerosis Risk}} in {{Communities Study}}},\n  author = {Shah, Anish S and Alonso, Alvaro and Whitsel, Eric A and Soliman, Elsayed Z and Vaccarino, Viola and Shah, Amit J},\n  date = {2020-03-03},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {141},\n  issn = {0009-7322},\n  doi = {10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.p542},\n  url = {https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.P542},\n  urldate = {2020-03-31},\n  abstract = {Introduction: Psychosocial factors are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but our understanding of causal mechanisms is limited. Understanding such mechanisms may help formulate prevention strategies. We therefore sought to evaluate potential physiologic effects of psychosocial factors by studying their associations with heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Hypothesis: Higher psychosocial stress levels are associated with lower HRV cross-sectionally in a diverse community sample. Methods: We included ARIC cohort participants with information on psychosocial factors in 1990-1992 into our analysis. Psychosocial factors were assessed using validated instruments, including: 1) vital exhaustion, a somatic manifestation of chronic stress and depression, 2) anger proneness, a personality trait, and 3) perceived social support, a potential buffering factor for stress. Short-term time and frequency domain HRV were measured from a two-minute electrocardiographic recording in 1987-1989. Linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We included 9,332 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 5.7 years, 55\\% women, and 25\\% black) in the analysis. Only vital exhaustion was consistently associated with HRV, as per the table, which shows the change in ln(HRV) per point increase in score. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of vital exhaustion was associated with a 13.3\\% (95\\% CI, 3.9\\% - 21.3\\%) decrease in low frequency HRV in adjusted models. By comparison, each year of added age was associated with a 3.7\\% (95\\% CI, 3.1\\% to 4.2\\%) decrease in LF HRV. Conclusion: A high level of vital exhaustion was associated with low HRV, while anger proneness and social support were not.

Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29\\% (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95\\% CI, 1.03 to 1.26; P≥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95\\% CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95\\% CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95\\% CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95\\% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95\\% CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95\\% CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95\\% CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes. Comprehensive screening and treatment of both somatic and cognitive symptoms may be necessary to optimize depression recognition and treatment in AMI patients.

Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. Results: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B per SD increase =.02, 95\\% confidence interval:.00;.05, p =.07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B per SD increase =.28, 95\\% confidence interval:.12;.44, p {$<$}.001).

Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9{$<$}10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7\\%) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4\\%) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1\\% versus 6.7\\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8\\% versus 6.1\\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95\\% confidence interval, 1.39-2.62).

We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Methods: We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples. Findings: SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p{$<$}5×10-8) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers. Interpretation: Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.},\n  isbn = {1474-547X (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0140-6736 (Linking)}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968350,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":445},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2149,"entry":"@article{Soliman2014,\n  title = {The Paradox of Atrial Fibrillation in {{African Americans}}.},\n  author = {Soliman, Elsayed Z and Prineas, Ronald J},\n  date = {2014},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of electrocardiology},\n  volume = {47},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {25112176},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {804--8},\n  issn = {1532-8430},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2014.07.010},\n  abstract = {The reported lower prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) despite the higher prevalence of AF risk factors in African Americans compared to Caucasian whites has been referred to as the paradox of AF in African Americans.

We focus on several approaches to dose-response in occupational cohort studies. Categorical analyses are useful for detecting the shape of dose-response. However, they depend on the number and location of cutpoints and result in step functions rather than smooth curves. Restricted cubic splines and penalized splines are useful parametric techniques that provide smooth curves. Although splines can complement categorical analyses, they do not provide interpretable parameters. The shapes of these curves will depend on the degree of \"smoothing\" chosen by the analyst. We recommend combining categorical analyses and some type of smoother, with the goal of developing a reasonably simple parametric model. A simple parametric model should serve as the goal of dose-response analyses because (1) most \"true\" exposure response curves in nature may be reasonably simple, (2) a simple parametric model is easily communicated and used by others, and (3) a simple parametric model is the best tool for risk assessors and regulators seeking to estimate individual excess risks per unit of exposure. We discuss these issues and others, including whether the best model is always the one that fits the best, reasons to prefer a linear model for risk in the low-exposure region when conducting risk assessment, and common methods of calculating excess lifetime risk at a given exposure from epidemiologic results (eg, from rate ratios).

Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued β-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

Epidemiological data show that chronic stress predicts the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Employees who experience work-related stress and individuals who are socially isolated or lonely have an increased risk of a first CHD event. In addition, short-term emotional stress can act as a trigger of cardiac events among individuals with advanced atherosclerosis. A stress-specific coronary syndrome, known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning cardiomyopathy or stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, also exists. Among patients with CHD, acute psychological stress has been shown to induce transient myocardial ischemia and long-term stress can increase the risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality.

A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March 2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox proportional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. However, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95\\% confidence interval, 1.08-1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (hazard ratio 0.92, 95\\% confidence interval, 0.78-1.09). The association of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with social isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely to be more relevant to mortality.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/KAB52QHD/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968369,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":451},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":997,"entry":"@article{Strike2003,\n  title = {Systematic Review of Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischaemia},\n  author = {Strike, P C and Steptoe, A},\n  date = {2003},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {24},\n  number = {8},\n  pages = {690--703},\n  issn = {0195668X},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0195-668X(02)00615-2},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/24/8/690/2733934},\n  urldate = {2019-10-18},\n  abstract = {There is growing evidence that psychosocial stress can influence the natural history of coronary heart disease.1 Epidemiological studies indicate that psychosocial factors both contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), and increase risk of cardiac dysfunction and the likelihood of cardiac events in susceptible patients with established disease.2,3 An important method of assessing effects on cardiac function is by measuring transient ischaemic responses to standardized mental stress tests. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia (MSIMI) is analogous to exercise stress ischaemia, except that the stimulus is psychological rather than physical. MSIMI has been studied with a number of different imaging techniques and with a range of stressful stimuli. But several investigations have involved small numbers of patients, and the medication status of patients has been variable. This has resulted in diverse findings concerning the prevalence of MSIMI, the conditions in which it is elicited, the type of patients who are most susceptible, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, and its clinical significance. In an effort to clarify these issues, we have conducted a systematic review of studies in which myocardial ischaemic responses have been measured in response to standardized mental stressors in the laboratory and clinic. Relevant articles were identified from searches of PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)between 1980 and 2002. Only articles in English language peer-reviewed publications were examined. We included studies that examined the link between standardized mental stress tests and myocardial ischaemic responses.

APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios {$<$}1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32\\% (95\\% confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23\\% (95\\% confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite.

Methods: In 526 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of clinical paroxysmal/persistent CAFL or AF in our hospital, we enrolled only patients under 60 years old. Cases harboring both AFL and AF were excluded. We analyzed the patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during sinus rhythm, and clinical course after ablation. Results: In total, 196 patients (Cohort 1: 142 males, 156 AF cases) were analyzed. AFL patients were younger than AF patients (47.4 ± 10.6 vs. 50.2 ± 6.4years, p = 0.031) and organic heart disease (OHD) was significantly more common in AFL patients than AF patients (42.5\\% vs. 11.5\\%, p{$<$}0.001).

This study aimed to elucidate the incidences of AF recurrence and of progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF, after CA, in patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods and Results— We examined the incidence of AF recurrence and AF progression in 1220 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 years), with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, undergoing CA, based on extensive pulmonary vein isolation and focal ablation for nonpulmonary vein foci. AF recurrence–free survival probabilities at 5 years were 59.4\\% after the initial CA and 81.1\\% after the final CA (average, 1.3 procedures). During a median follow-up period of 47.9 (range, 5.3–123.3) months after the initial CA, AF progressed from paroxysmal to persistent in 15 (1.2\\%) patients (0.3\\%/y). The duration of AF history (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; P{$<$}0.0001), number of ineffective antiarrhythmics (HR, 1.09; P=0.005), and left atrial diameter indexed by the body surface area (HR, 1.05; P=0.001) were significant predictors of AF recurrence. Patient age (HR, 1.12; P=0.0001) and left atrial diameter indexed by the body surface area (HR, 1.26; P=0.0006) were significantly associated with AF progression.

We imaged the amygdala, a brain region involved in stress, to determine whether its resting metabolic activity predicts risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Methods Individuals aged 30 years or older without known cardiovascular disease or active cancer disorders, who underwent 18F-fluorodexoyglucose PET/CT at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2008, were studied longitudinally. Amygdalar activity, bone-marrow activity, and arterial inflammation were assessed with validated methods. In a separate cross-sectional study we analysed the relation between perceived stress, amygdalar activity, arterial inflammation, and C-reactive protein. Image analyses and cardiovascular disease event adjudication were done by mutually blinded researchers. Relations between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events were assessed with Cox models, log-rank tests, and mediation (path) analyses. Findings 293 patients (median age 55 years [IQR 45·0–65·5]) were included in the longitudinal study, 22 of whom had a cardiovascular disease event during median follow-up of 3·7 years (IQR 2·7–4·8). Amygdalar activity was associated with increased bone-marrow activity (r=0·47; p{$<$}0·0001), arterial inflammation (r=0·49; p{$<$}0·0001), and risk of cardiovascular disease events (standardised hazard ratio 1·59, 95\\% CI 1·27–1·98; p{$<$}0·0001), a finding that remained significant after multivariate adjustments. The association between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events seemed to be mediated by increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation in series. In the separate cross-sectional study of patients who underwent psychometric analysis (n=13), amygdalar activity was significantly associated with arterial inflammation (r=0·70; p=0·0083). Perceived stress was associated with amygdalar activity (r=0·56; p=0·0485), arterial inflammation (r=0·59; p=0·0345), and C-reactive protein (r=0·83; p=0·0210). Interpretation In this first study to link regional brain activity to subsequent cardiovascular disease, amygdalar activity independently and robustly predicted cardiovascular disease events. Amygdalar activity is involved partly via a path that includes increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism through which emotional stressors can lead to cardiovascular disease in human beings.

Background--ECG global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is associated with sudden cardiac death. We hypothesized that a genomewide association study would identify genetic loci related to GEH. Methods and Results--We tested genotyped and imputed variants in black (N=3057) and white (N=10 769) participants in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study). GEH (QRS-T angle, sum absolute QRST integral, spatial ventricular gradient magnitude, elevation, azimuth) was measured on 12-lead ECGs. Linear regression models were constructed with each GEH variable as an outcome, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, study site, and principal components to account for ancestry. GWAS identified 10 loci that showed genome-wide significant association with GEH in whites or joint ancestry. The strongest signal (rs7301677, near TBX3) was associated with QRS-T angle (white standardized β+0.16 [95\\% CI 0.13-0.19]; P=1.5×10 -26 ), spatial ventricular gradient elevation (+0.11 [0.08-0.14]; P=2.1×10 -12 ), and spatial ventricular gradient magnitude (-0.12 [95\\% CI -0.15 to -0.09]; P=5.9×10 -15 ). Altogether, GEH-SNPs explained 1.1\\% to 1.6\\% of GEH variance. Loci on chromosomes 4 (near HMCN2), 5 (IGF1R), 11 (11p11.2 region cluster), and 7 (near ACTB) are novel ECG phenotype-associated loci. Several loci significantly associated with gene expression in the left ventricle (HMCN2 locus-with HMCN2; IGF1R locus-with IGF1R), and atria (RP11-481J2.2 locus-with expression of a long non-coding RNA and NDRG4). Conclusions--We identified 10 genetic loci associated with ECG GEH. Replication of GEH GWAS findings in independent cohorts is warranted.

Often, potentially important new predictors are available in addition to the conventional markers. The question is how to quantify the improvement from the new markers for prediction of the patient's risk in order to aid cost-benefit decisions. The standard method, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, to measure the added value may not be sensitive enough to capture incremental improvements from the new markers. Recently, some novel alternatives to area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, such as integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement, were proposed. In this paper, we consider a class of measures for evaluating the incremental values of new markers, which includes the preceding two as special cases. We present a unified procedure for making inferences about measures in the class with censored event time data. The large sample properties of our procedures are theoretically justified.

The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14\\% lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006).

Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio {$<$}2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p {$<$} 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of {$<$}2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors. Our results, using a controlled twin design, highlight the importance of coronary microvascular function in the early phases of CAD. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},\n  keywords = {circulation,coronary disease,endothelium,imaging,inflammation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/PRGPW3XS/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968442,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":467},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":953,"entry":"@article{Vaccarino2014,\n  title = {Sex Differences in Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia in Young Survivors of an Acute Myocardial Infarction},\n  author = {Vaccarino, Viola and Shah, Amit J. and Rooks, Cherie and Ibeanu, Ijeoma and Nye, Jonathon A. and Pimple, Pratik and Salerno, Amy and D'Marco, Luis and Karohl, Cristina and Bremner, James Douglas and Raggi, Paolo},\n  date = {2014-04},\n  journaltitle = {Psychosomatic Medicine},\n  volume = {76},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {24608039},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {171--180},\n  issn = {15347796},\n  doi = {10.1097/PSY.0000000000000045},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608039},\n  urldate = {2018-11-25},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emotional stress may disproportionally affect young women with ischemic heart disease.

Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22\\% versus 11\\%, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31\\% versus 16\\%, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.},\n  keywords = {done,Ischemia,Microcirculation,Sex,Stress,Vascular function},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/5GEEJ5UX/2018 - Vaccarino et al. - Mental stress-induced-myocardial ischemia in young patients with recent myocardial infarction Sex differences.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968456,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":470},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1911,"entry":"@article{Vaccarino2021a,\n  title = {Association of {{Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia}} with {{Cardiovascular Events}} in {{Patients}} with {{Coronary Heart Disease}}},\n  author = {Vaccarino, Viola and Almuwaqqat, Zakaria and Kim, Jeong Hwan and Hammadah, Muhammad and Shah, Amit J.

Objective: To compare the association of mental stress-induced or conventional stress-induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020). Exposures: Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure. Results: Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34\\% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16\\%) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31\\%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10\\%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95\\% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95\\% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95\\% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95\\% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95\\% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95\\% CI, 1.5-2.5). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Methods and results: Using data from nationwide Danish health registries, we identified patients aged 18–75 years undergoing a first- time atrial flutter or an AF ablation procedure in the period 2000–13. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) after 5 years of follow-up, adjusting for concomitant risk factors. A total of 1096 and 2266 patients underwent an ablation for atrial flutter or AF, respectively. Age distribution was similar in the two, but atrial flutter patients had more co-morbidities. During 5 years of follow-up, we observed 38 and 36 deaths in the atrial flutter and AF groups, corresponding to an almost two-fold higher mortality rate among atrial flutter patients [crude HR 1.92, 95\\% confidence interval (CI) 1.22–3.03]. The higher mortality rate persisted after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (adjusted HR 1.68, 95\\% CI 1.05–2.69).

The development of both is favored by the presence of common triggers and substrate, particularly in the setting of structural heart disease with its attendant electrical and structural remodel-ing. Conditions associated with atrial remodeling, including heart failure, hypertension, increasing age and valvular heart disease, predispose to both fibrillation and flutter. The nature of the \"peri-tricuspid\" macroreentry circuit, constrained by structural and functional barriers to electrical propagation, is now well understood. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that CTI-dependent AFL is most frequently preceded by a period of short cycle length atrial activation, and in particular by a period of AF. 1-4 Such activity induces regions of functional conduction block and slowed conduction that are necessary for the transition from multiple unstable wavefronts to a single organized circuit. 5,6 The development of functional conduction block along the crista terminalis seems particularly important in the patho-genesis of CTI-dependent AFL. 7-9 Thus the same pulmonary vein (PV) and non-PV triggers that initiate AF are also responsible , via transitional AF, for onset of the great majority of AFL episodes. This background is of prime importance when considering the accumulated literature evaluating the incidence of AF late after AFL ablation. This incidence is clearly time-dependent with reported rates of 17-22\\% at 6 months, increasing to 50\\% at 2 years and 63\\% at 4 years. 10,11 The most consistently identified risk factor for the development of post-ablation AF is documented pre-ablation AF, the prevalence of which varies according to the intensity of monitoring, 10-14 Other identified risk factors have included left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, 12,14 significant mitral regurgitation, 10 left atrial (LA) enlargement, 11,15 and the failure of multiple antiarrhyth-mic drugs (AADs). 14 All are associated with LA remodeling and an elevated risk of incident AF regardless of AFL abla-tion. Importantly, the incidence of AF after AFL ablation is also proportional to the intensity of monitoring. In a small study of patients who had loop recorders implanted after flutter ablation, 55\\% developed new AF within the first year of follow-up. 16 It seems probable that the variability in the reported incidence of post-ablation AF is related in large part to varying intensities of monitoring. In this issue of the Journal, Brembilla-Perrot and colleagues 17 further explore the incidence of and risk factors for AF following ablation of AFL. They present a large single-center series of 1,121 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation of CTI-dependent AFL, with data retrospectively extracted by chart review. A history of AF before AFL ablation was present in 31.8\\% of patients, but the nature of pre-ablation monitoring to determine this is not described. It is probable that the real AF incidence before ablation was much higher. Follow-up was continued for a mean of 2.1 ± 2.7 years, and included ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring at 1 month but thereafter only at annual intervals or for investigation of symptoms. Using this approach, new AF was observed during follow-up in 19.3\\% of patients without pre-ablation AF, but ongoing AF was only detected in 31.5\\% of patients who did have pre-ablation AF. The study thus observed a fall in the overall AF incidence post-ablation (23.2\\%) compared with pre-ablation (31.8\\%), with a particularly marked fall in the group with AF before AFL ablation. This result should be viewed in the context of the limited post-ablation monitoring performed. Nevertheless, the ongoing involvement with the healthcare system remained significant with 8\\% developing permanent AF, 7\\% requiring electrical cardioversion, 7\\% atrio-ventricular node ablation and 15\\% pacemaker implantation. These data certainly make it difficult to argue that AFL ablation in this population provides a definitive result. Only AF history and female gender were significant pre-dictors of AF occurrence post-ablation. Other established markers of AF risk such as age, hypertension, diabetes and various forms of structural heart disease were not associated with post-ablation AF in this study. Importantly, at the time of ablation 50.5\\% had a CHADS 2 score 1 and although only 2 strokes occurred during follow-up both were in patients who were not anti-coagulated and who had AF recurrence.},\n  keywords = {atrial flutter,clinical: catheter ablation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7NNETFNB/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968497,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":479},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1155,"entry":"@article{Wang2014b,\n  title = {Social Support Moderates Stress Effects on Depression},\n  author = {Wang, Xingmin and Cai, Lin and Qian, Jing and Peng, Jiaxi},\n  date = {2014},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Mental Health Systems},\n  volume = {8},\n  number = {1},\n  publisher = {{BioMed Central Ltd.}},\n  issn = {17524458},\n  doi = {10.1186/1752-4458-8-41},\n  abstract = {This study examined the moderator effect of social support on the relationship between stress and depression of university students.

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of {$<$}200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85\\% male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95\\% confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0\\%, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of \"hard\" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95\\% CI) was 1.54 (95\\% CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95\\% CI 1.17 to 2.64) for \"hard\" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of \"hard\" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger. The multivariate-adjusted HR of CHD for high versus low anger was 2.20 (95\\% CI 1.36 to 3.55) and for moderate versus low anger was 1.32 (95\\% CI 0.94 to 1.84).

Methods: The study included patients with an ECG recorded at the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory in 2001 to 2011. PTFV1 ≥4 mV·ms was considered abnormal. Patients with abnormal PTFV1 were stratified into tertiles based on duration (PTDV1) and amplitude (PTAV1) values. Cox regressions adjusted for age, sex, and relevant comorbidities were used to investigate associations between abnormal PTFV1 components and AF and stroke/TIA. Results: Of 267,636 patients, 5803 had AF and 18,176 had stroke/TIA (follow-up 6.5 years). Abnormal PTFV1 was present in 44,549 subjects (16.7\\%) and was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Among patients with abnormal PTFV1, the highest tertile of PTDV1 (78–97 ms) was associated with the highest risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.37; 95\\% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–1.52) and highest risk of stroke/TIA (HR 1.13; 95\\% CI 1.05 –1.20).

In ventricular cardiomyocytes, the membrane deformation protein cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1 or BIN1+13+17) creates transverse-tubule (t-tubule) membrane microfolds, which facilitate ion channel trafficking and modulate local ionic concentrations. The microfold-generated microdomains continuously reorganize, adapting in response to stress to modulate the calcium signaling apparatus. We explored the possibility that cBIN1-microfolds are externally released from cardiomyocytes. Using electron microscopy imaging with immunogold labeling, we found in mouse plasma that cBIN1 exists in membrane vesicles about 200 nm in size, which is consistent with the size of MPs. In mice with cardiac-specific heterozygous Bin1 deletion, flow cytometry identified 47\\% less cBIN1-MPs in plasma, supporting cardiac origin. Cardiac release was also evidenced by the detection of cBIN1-MPs in medium bathing a pure population of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. In human plasma, osmotic shock increased cBIN1 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cBIN1 level decreased in humans with heart failure, a condition with reduced cardiac muscle cBIN1, both of which support cBIN1 release in MPs from human hearts. Exploring putative mechanisms of MP release, we found that the membrane fission complex endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B) colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with cBIN1, an interaction enhanced by actin stabilization. In HeLa cells with cBIN1 overexpression, knockdown of CHMP4B reduced the release of cBIN1-MPs. Using truncation mutants, we identified that the N-terminal BAR (N-BAR) domain in cBIN1 is required for CHMP4B binding and MP release. This study links the BAR protein superfamily to the ESCRT pathway for MP biogenesis in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells, identifying elements of a pathway by which cytoplasmic cBIN1 is released into blood.},\n  isbn = {1111111111}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968523,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":485},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1637,"entry":"@article{Yannopoulos2019,\n  title = {The {{Evolving Role}} of the {{Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory}} in the {{Management}} of {{Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest}}: {{A Scientific Statement From}} the {{American Heart Association}}},\n  author = {Yannopoulos, Demetris and Bartos, Jason A. and Aufderheide, Tom P. and Callaway, Clifton W. and Deo, Rajat and Garcia, Santiago and Halperin, Henry R. and Kern, Karl B. and Kudenchuk, Peter J. and Neumar, Robert W. and Raveendran, Ganesh},\n  date = {2019-03-19},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {139},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {30760026},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {e530-e552},\n  publisher = {{NLM (Medline)}},\n  issn = {15244539},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIR.0000000000000630},\n  url = {http://ahajournals.org},\n  urldate = {2020-08-26},\n  abstract = {Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT).

Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70\\% to 85\\%. More than 90\\% of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25\\% to 50\\%. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10\\% to 15\\% absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9\\% to 45\\% in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.},\n  keywords = {AHA Scientific Statements,cardiac catheterization,laboratories,out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,percutaneous coronary intervention,tachycardia,ventricular,ventricular fibrillation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/43NUA4I7/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968529,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":486},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1992,"entry":"@article{Yeboah2016,\n  title = {Utility of {{Nontraditional Risk Markers}} in {{Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment}}},\n  author = {Yeboah, Joseph and Young, Rebekah and McClelland, Robyn L. and Delaney, Joseph C. and Polonsky, Tamar S. and Dawood, Farah Z. and Blaha, Michael J. and Miedema, Michael D. and Sibley, Christopher T. and Carr, J.

Methods The PCE was calibrated (cPCE) and used for this analysis. The Cox proportional hazards survival model, Harrell's C statistics, and net reclassification improvement analyses were used. ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease-related death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Results Of 6,814 MESA participants not prescribed statins at baseline, 5,185 had complete data and were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 61 years; 53.1\\% were women, 9.8\\% had diabetes, and 13.6\\% were current smokers. After 10 years of follow-up, 320 (6.2\\%) ASCVD events occurred. CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events in the multivariable Cox models. CAC score modestly improved the Harrell's C statistic (0.74 vs. 0.76; p = 0.04); ABI, hsCRP levels, and FH produced no improvement in Harrell's C statistic when added to the cPCE. Conclusions CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events.

Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports.

Objective: To examine the results of genetic testing for early-onset AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled participants from an academic medical center who had AF diagnosed before 66 years of age and underwent whole genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. Participants were enrolled from November 23, 1999, to June 2, 2015. Data analysis was performed from October 24, 2020, to March 11, 2021. Exposures: Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included on cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sequencing data were analyzed using an automated process followed by manual review by a panel of independent, blinded reviewers. The primary outcome was classification of rare variants using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria: benign, likely benign, variant of undetermined significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. Disease-associated variants were defined as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes associated with autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant disorders. Results: Among 1293 participants (934 [72.2\\%] male; median [interquartile range] age at enrollment, 56 [48-61] years; median [interquartile range] age at AF diagnosis, 50 [41-56] years), genetic testing identified 131 participants (10.1\\%) with a disease-associated variant, 812 (62.8\\%) with a variant of undetermined significance, 92 (7.1\\%) as heterozygous carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder, and 258 (20.0\\%) with no suspicious variant. The likelihood of a disease-associated variant was highest in participants with AF diagnosed before the age of 30 years (20 of 119 [16.8\\%; 95\\% CI, 10.0\\%-23.6\\%]) and lowest after the age of 60 years (8 of 112 [7.1\\%; 95\\% CI, 2.4\\%-11.9\\%]). Disease-associated variants were more often associated with inherited cardiomyopathy syndromes compared with inherited arrhythmias. The most common genes were TTN (n = 38), MYH7 (n = 18), MYH6 (n = 10), LMNA (n = 9), and KCNQ1 (n = 8). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, genetic testing identified a disease-associated variant in 10\\% of patients with early-onset AF (the percentage was higher if diagnosed before the age of 30 years and lower if diagnosed after the age of 60 years). Most pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants are in genes associated with cardiomyopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study included participants with AF diagnosed before 66 years of age who underwent whole-genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program.

Exposures Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was time to death and was adjudicated from medical records and the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association of disease-associated variants with risk of death after adjustment for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term of age at AF diagnosis and disease-associated variant status. Results Among 1293 participants (934 [72\\%] male; median age at enrollment, 56.0 years; IQR, 48.0-61.0 years), disease-associated (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) rare variants were found in 131 (10\\%). During a median follow-up of 9.9 years (IQR, 6.9-13.2 years), 219 participants (17\\%) died. In univariable analysis, disease-associated variants were associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, [HR], 1.5; 95\\% CI, 1.0-2.1;P = .05); the association remained significant in multivariable modeling when adjusted for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term between disease-associated variant status and age at AF diagnosis. The interaction demonstrated that disease-associated variants were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with no disease-associated variant when AF was diagnosed at a younger age (P = .008 for interaction). Higher body mass index (per IQR: HR, 1.4; 95\\% CI, 1.2-1.6;P {$<$} .001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (per IQR: HR, 0.8; 95\\% CI, 0.7-0.8;P {$<$} .001) were associated with higher mortality risk. There were 73 cardiomyopathy-related deaths, 40 sudden deaths, and 10 stroke-related deaths. Mortality among patients with the most prevalent genes with disease-associated variants was 26\\% (10 of 38 patients) forTTN, 33\\% (6 of 18) forMYH7, 22\\% (2 of 9) forLMNA, 0\\% (0 of 10) forMYH6, and 0\\% (0 of 8) forKCNQ1. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes may be associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with early-onset AF, especially those diagnosed at a younger age.

GWASs of three metabolites identified previously as risk factors for incident HF (pyroglutamine, dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid, and X-11787, being either hydroxy-leucine or hydroxy-isoleucine) were performed in 1,260 African Americans free of HF at the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. A significant association on chromosome 5q33 (rs10463316, MAF = 0.358, P-value = 1.92 × 10(-10) ) was identified for pyroglutamine.

Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory (\"Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test\", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed (\"Digit Symbol Substitution Test\", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function (\"Stroop interference\"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7\\% female, 42.2\\% Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: β = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: β = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: β = 1.19 points better, P {$<$} 0.05; and quartile2: β = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02).

The most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the e4 allele of APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E, a lipid carrier shown to modulate brain amyloid burden. Recent genome-wide association studies have uncovered additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to AD susceptibility, including those in the CLU and BIN1 genes encoding for clusterin (CLU) and the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) proteins, respectively. Because CLU has been implicated in brain amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance in mouse models of amyloid deposition, we sought to investigate whether an AD-linked SNP in the CLU gene altered Aβ42 biomarker levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, we found that the CLU rs11136000 SNP modified CSF levels of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in AD patients. We also found that an intracellular form of CLU (iCLU) was upregulated in the brain of Tau overexpressing Tg4510 mice, but not in Tg2576 amyloid mouse model. By overexpressing iCLU and Tau in cell culture systems we discovered that iCLU was a Tau-interacting protein and that iCLU associated with brain-specific isoforms of BIN1, also recently identified as a Tau-binding protein. Through expression analysis of CLU and BIN1 variants, we found that CLU and BIN1 interacted via their coiled-coil motifs. In co-immunoprecipitation studies using human brain tissue, we showed that iCLU and the major BIN1 isoform expressed in neurons were associated with modified Tau species found in AD. Finally, we showed that expression of certain coding CLU variants linked to AD risk led to increased levels of iCLU. Together, our findings suggest that iCLU and BIN1 interaction might impact Tau function in neurons and uncover potential new mechanisms underlying the etiology of Tau pathology in AD.},\n  isbn = {1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686535968578,"version":0,"updated":1686705215863},"$loki":495},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2087,"entry":"@article{Zöller2013,\n  title = {High Familial Risk of Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter in Multiplex Families: A Nationwide Family Study in {{Sweden}}.},\n  author = {Zöller, Bengt and Ohlsson, Henrik and Sundquist, Jan and Sundquist, Kristina},\n  date = {2013},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American Heart Association},\n  volume = {2},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {23525409},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  issn = {20479980},\n  doi = {10.1161/JAHA.112.003384},\n  abstract = {Although the heritability of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFl) has been determined, the familial risk in multiplex families is unclear.

METHODS: Using the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF, we analysed the incidence and predictors of progression and tested the discrimination and calibration of the HATCH (hypertension, age, TIA/stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure) and CHA₂DS₂VASc scores for identifying AF progression. RESULTS: Among 6235 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF at baseline, 1479 progressed, during follow-up (median 18 (IQR 12-24) months). These patients were older and had more comorbidities than patients who did not progress (CHADS₂ 2.3±1.3 vs 2.1±1.3, p{$<$}0.0001). At baseline, patients with AF progression were more often on a rate control as opposed to a rhythm control strategy (66 vs 56\\%, p{$<$}0.0001) and had higher heart rate (72(64-80) vs 68(60-76) bpm, p{$<$}0.0001).

The present work aims to review the previous findings on these topics and integrate them from two main cornerstones of this perspective: Porges' Polyvagal Theory and Thayer and Lane's Neurovisceral Integration Model, which are necessary to understand these associations better. For this reason, based on these two approaches, we point out that low HRV is associated with emotional dysregulation, worse cognitive performance, and transversal psychopathological conditions. We report studies that underline the importance of considering the heart-brain relation in order to shed light on the necessity to implement psychophysiology into a broader perspective on emotions, mental health, and good cognitive functioning.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study, performed from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, used electronic health record (EHR) data from a large integrated health care delivery system. Exposures: Calendar year trends. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalizations for WHF (ie, excluding observation stays) were defined as 1 symptom or more, 2 objective findings or more including 1 sign or more, and 2 doses or more of intravenous loop diuretics and/or new hemodialysis or continuous kidney replacement therapy. Symptoms and signs were identified using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms applied to EHR data. Results: The study population was composed of 118002 eligible patients experiencing 287992 unique hospitalizations (mean [SD] age, 75.6 [13.1] years; 147203 [51.1\\%] male; 1655 [0.6\\%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 28451 [9.9\\%] Asian or Pacific Islander, 34903 [12.1\\%] Black, 23452 [8.1\\%] multiracial, 175840 [61.1\\%] White, and 23691 [8.2\\%] unknown), including 65357 with a principal discharge diagnosis and 222635 with a secondary discharge diagnosis of HF. The study population included 59868 patients (20.8\\%) with HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) ({$<$}40\\%), 33361 (11.6\\%) with HF with a midrange EF (HFmrEF) (40\\%-49\\%), 142347 (49.4\\%) with HF with a preserved EF (HFpEF) (≥50\\%), and 52416 (18.2\\%) with unknown EF. A total of 58042 admissions (88.8\\%) with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF and 62764 admissions (28.2\\%) with a secondary discharge diagnosis of HF met the prespecified diagnostic criteria for WHF. Overall, hospitalizations for WHF identified on NLP-based algorithms increased from 5.2 to 7.6 per 100 hospitalizations per year during the study period. Subgroup analyses found an increase in hospitalizations for WHF based on NLP from 1.5 to 1.9 per 100 hospitalizations for HFrEF, from 0.6 to 1.0 per 100 hospitalizations for HFmrEF, and from 2.6 to 3.9 per 100 hospitalizations for HFpEF. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that the burden of hospitalizations for WHF may be more than double that previously estimated using only principal discharge diagnosis.

We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health. METHODS: We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499\\,727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275\\,056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation.

The 24-hour total power also had a significant and strong association with all three mortality end points. VLF power was the only variable that was more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with cardiac death or all-cause mortality. In multivariate Cox regression models using a step-up approach to evaluate the independent associations between frequency domain measures of heart period variability and death of all causes, ULF power was selected first (i.e., was the single component with the strongest association). Adding VLF or LF power to the Cox regression model significantly improved the prediction of outcome. With both ULF and VLF power in the Cox regression model, the addition of the other two components, LF and HF power, singly or together, did not significantly improve the prediction of all-cause mortality. We explored the relation between the heart period variability measures and all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death before and after adjusting for five previously established postinfarction risk predictors: age, New York Heart Association functional class, rales in the coronary care unit, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular arrhythmias detected in a 24-hour Holter ECG recording. CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for the five risk predictors, the association between mortality and total, ULF, and VLF power remained significant and strong, whereas LF and HF power were only moderately strongly associated with mortality. The tendency for VLF power to be more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with all-cause or cardiac death was still evident after adjusting for the five covariates. Adding measures of HPV to previously known predictors of risk after myocardial infarction identifies small subgroups with a 2.5-year mortality risk of approximately 50\\%.},\n  isbn = {0735-1097},\n  keywords = {Electrocardiography,{Nervous system, autonomic},Vagus nerves}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565063,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":504},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":697,"entry":"@article{Billman2011a,\n  title = {Heart Rate Variability - {{A}} Historical Perspective},\n  author = {Billman, George E.},\n  date = {2011},\n  journaltitle = {Frontiers in Physiology},\n  volume = {2 NOV},\n  eprint = {22144961},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  issn = {1664042X},\n  doi = {10.3389/fphys.2011.00086},\n  url = {www.frontiersin.org},\n  urldate = {2018-10-27},\n  abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the \"Physician's Pulse Watch\" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},\n  isbn = {1664-042X (Electronic)\\textbackslash r1664-042X (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,Frequency domain,Heart rate variability,Respiratory sinus arrhythmia,Time domain},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/YTINB8U2/2011 - Billman - Heart rate variability - A historical perspective.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565074,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":505},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":670,"entry":"@article{Billman2013,\n  title = {The {{LF}}/{{HF}} Ratio Does Not Accurately Measure Cardiac Sympatho-Vagal Balance},\n  author = {Billman, George E.},\n  date = {2013},\n  journaltitle = {Frontiers in Physiology},\n  volume = {4 FEB},\n  eprint = {23431279},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {26},\n  publisher = {{Billman}},\n  issn = {1664042X},\n  doi = {10.3389/fphys.2013.00026},\n  url = {www.frontiersin.org},\n  urldate = {2018-09-26},\n  abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) {$<$}0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease.

Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},\n  isbn = {1664-042X},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GFKQZ9ZK/2013 - Billman - The LFHF ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympatho-vagal balance.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565080,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":506},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":692,"entry":"@article{Billman2013c,\n  title = {The Effect of Heart Rate on the Heart Rate Variability Response to Autonomic Interventions},\n  author = {Billman, George E.},\n  date = {2013},\n  journaltitle = {Frontiers in Physiology},\n  volume = {4},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {23986716},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {282--293},\n  issn = {1664-042X},\n  doi = {10.3389/fphys.2013.00222},\n  url = {www.frontiersin.org},\n  urldate = {2018-09-30},\n  abstract = {Computational experiment approach considers models as the fundamental instructional units of Inquiry Based Science and Mathematics Education (IBSE) and STEM Education, where the model take the place of the “classical” experimental set-up and simulation replaces the experiment.

An emerging analysis technique is the Poincaré plot, which takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval. The geometry of this plot has been shown to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy subjects in clinical settings. The Poincaré plot is a valuable HRV analysis technique due to its ability to display nonlinear aspects of the interval sequence. The problem is, how do we quantitatively characterize the plot to capture useful summary descriptors that are independent of existing HRV measures? Researchers have investigated a number of techniques: converting the two-dimensional plot into various one-dimensional views; the fitting of an ellipse to the plot shape; and measuring the correlation coefficient of the plot. We investigate each of these methods in detail and show that they are all measuring linear aspects of the intervals which existing HRV indexes already specify. The fact that these methods appear insensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the intervals is an important finding because the Poincaré plot is primarily a nonlinear technique.

We used progressive low dose atropine to induce changes in cardiac vagal tone to test the hypotheses that nonlinear HRV indices accurately reflect cardiac vagal control, and that their changes in response to low dose atropine correlate with those in RR interval. Methods: Changes in RR interval and HRV indices during intravenous injections of saline (control) and 6 cumulative doses of atropine (from 1.4 to 7.2 μg/kg) during controlled breathing at 15 breaths per minute were assessed in 14 young healthy individuals. Results: As expected, low dose atropine increased average RR interval (vagotonic effect). There was no strong association between vagotonic changes in RR interval and the majority of nonlinear HRV indices, either within or among subjects. Conclusions: These data suggest an inconsistent relationship between responses of nonlinear HRV indices and RR interval to changes in cardiac vagal tone. Therefore, nonlinear HRV indices may not be reliable indices of cardiac vagal control in healthy humans.},\n  keywords = {Atropine,Autonomic control,Heart rate variability,RR interval,Vagal outflow}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565110,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":511},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1466,"entry":"@thesis{Clifford2002,\n  title = {Signal {{Processing Methods For Heart Rate Variability Analysis}}},\n  author = {Clifford, Gari D},\n  date = {2002},\n  url = {https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:5129701f-1d40-425a-99a3-59a05e8c1b23/datastreams/THESIS01},\n  urldate = {2018-10-06},\n  abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate calculated from the electrocar- diogram (ECG), is a key indicator of an individual’s cardiovascular condition. Assessment of HRV has been shown to aid clinical diagnosis and intervention strategies. However, the variety of HRV estima- tion methods and contradictory reports in this field indicate that there is a need for a more rigorous investigation of these methods as aids to clinical evaluation. This thesis investigates the development of appropriate HRV signal processing techniques in the context of pilot studies in two fields of potential application, sleep and head-up tilting (HUT). A novel method for characterising normality in the ECG using both timing information and morpho- logical characteristics is presented. A neural network, used to learn the beat-to-beat variations in ECG waveform morphology, is shown to provide a highly sensitive technique for identifying normal beats. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based frequency-domain HRV techniques, which require re-sampling of the inherently unevenly sampled heart beat time-series (RR tachogram) to produce an evenly sampled time series, are then explored using a newmethod for producing an artificial RRtachogram. Re-sampling is shown to produce a significant error in the estimation of an (entirely specified) artificial RR tachogram. The Lomb periodogram, a method which requires no re-sampling and is applicable to the unevenly sampled nature of the signal is investigated. Experiments demonstrate that the Lomb periodogram is superior to the FFT for evaluating HRV measured by the ?? -ratio, a ratio of the low to high frequency ?? power in the RR tachogram within a specified band (0.04–0.4Hz). The effect of adding artificial ectopic beats in the RR tachogram is then considered and it is shown that ectopic beats significantly alter the spectrum and therefore must be removed or replaced. Replacing ectopic beats by phantom beats is compared to the case of ectopic-realted RR interval removal for the FFT and Lomb methods for varying levels of ectopy. The Lomb periodogram is shown to provide a significantly better estimate of the ?? - ?? ratio under these conditions and is a robust method for measuring the ?? -ratio in the presence of (a ?? possibly unknown number of) ectopic beats or artefacts. The Lomb periodogram and FFT-based techniques are applied to a database of sleep apn ? ic and normal subjects. A new method of assessing HRVduring sleep is proposed to minimise the confounding effects on HRV of changes due to changing mental activity. Estimation of ?? -ratio using the Lomb ?? technique is shown to separate these two patient groups more effectively than with FFT-based techniques. Results are also presented for the application of these methods to controlled (HUT) studies on subjects with syncope, an autonomic nervous system problem, which indicate that the techniques developed in this thesis may provide a method for differentiating between sub-classes of syncope},\n  pagetotal = {1-244},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ZZG5XGTE/2002 - Clifford - Signal Processing Methods For Heart Rate Variability Analysis.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565120,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":512},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":688,"entry":"@article{Clifford2005,\n  title = {Quantifying Errors in Spectral Estimates of {{HRV}} Due to Beat Replacement and Resampling},\n  author = {Clifford, Gari D. and Tarassenko, Lionel},\n  date = {2005},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering},\n  volume = {52},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {15825865},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {630--638},\n  issn = {00189294},\n  doi = {10.1109/TBME.2005.844028},\n  abstract = {Spectral estimates of heart rate variability (HRV) often involve the use of techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which require an evenly sampled time series. HRV is calculated from the variations in the beat-to-beat (RR) interval timing of the cardiac cycle which are inherently irregularly spaced in time. In order to produce an evenly sampled time series prior to FFT-based spectral estimation, linear or cubic spline resampling is usually employed. In this paper, by using a realistic artificial RR interval generator, interpolation and resampling is shown to result in consistent over-estimations of the power spectral density (PSD) compared with the theoretical solution. The Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, a more appropriate spectral estimation technique for unevenly sampled time series that uses only the original data, is shown to provide a superior PSD estimate. Ectopy removal or replacement is shown to be essential regardless of the spectral estimation technique. Resampling and phantom beat replacement is shown to decrease the accuracy of PSD estimation, even at low levels of ectopy or artefact. A linear relationship between the frequency of ectopy/artefact and the error (mean and variance) of the PSD estimate is demonstrated.

Despite their wide use, HRV metrics are usually analyzed and interpreted without reference to prevailing levels of cardiac chronotropic state (i.e., mean heart rate or mean heart period). This isolated treatment of HRV metrics is nontrivial. All HRV metrics routinely used in the literature exhibit a known and positive relationship with the mean duration of the interval between two beats (heart period): as the heart period increases, so does its variability. This raises the question of whether HRV metrics should be “corrected” for the mean heart period (or its inverse, the heart rate). Here, we outline biological, quantitative, and interpretive issues engendered by this question. We provide arguments that HRV is neither uniformly nor simply a surrogate for heart period. We also identify knowledge gaps that remain to be satisfactorily addressed with respect to assumptions underlying existing HRV correction approaches.

PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet. org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},\n  keywords = {aging databases death,autonomic nonlinear dynamics,sudden electrophysiology heart rate nervous system},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GU6I5HX5/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565146,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":515},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":703,"entry":"@article{Goldstein2011,\n  title = {Low-Frequency Power of Heart Rate Variability Is Not a Measure of Cardiac Sympathetic Tone but May Be a Measure of Modulation of Cardiac Autonomic Outflows by Baroreflexes},\n  author = {Goldstein, David S. and Bentho, Oladi and Park, Mee Yeong and Sharabi, Yehonatan},\n  date = {2011},\n  journaltitle = {Experimental Physiology},\n  volume = {96},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {21890520},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1255--1261},\n  issn = {09580670},\n  doi = {10.1113/expphysiol.2010.056259},\n  abstract = {Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability has often been used to assess cardiac autonomic function; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power of heart rate variability to cardiac sympathetic tone has been unclear.

Therefore, interventions that enhance cardiac sympathetic drive, e.g., exercise and myocardial ischemia, should elicit increases in the low-frequency power. Furthermore, because an enhanced sympathetic activation has been linked to an increased propensity for malignant arrhythmias, one might also predict a greater low-frequency power in animals that are susceptible to ventricular fibrillation than in resistant animals. To test these hypotheses, a 2-min coronary occlusion was made during the last minute of exercise in 71 dogs with healed myocardial infarctions: 43 had ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) and 28 did not experience arrhythmias (resistant). Exercise or ischemia alone provoked significant heart rate increases in both groups of animals, with the largest increase in the susceptible animals. These heart rate increases were attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Despite the sympathetically mediated increases in heart rate, the low-frequency power decreased, rather than increased, in both groups, with the largest decrease again in the susceptible animals: 4.0 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 4.1 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) in preexercise control and 2.2 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) at highest exercise level. In a similar manner the parasympathetic antagonist atropine sulfate elicited significant reductions in the low-frequency power. Although sympathetic nerve activity was not directly recorded, these data suggest that the low-frequency component of the heart rate power spectrum probably results from an interaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and, as such, does not accurately reflect changes in the sympathetic activity.},\n  isbn = {0002-9513 (Print)\\textbackslash r0002-9513 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,Baroreceptor reflex,done,Spectral analysis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/D7P2UP8I/1999 - Houle, Billman - Low-frequency component of the heart rate variability spectrum a poor marker of sympathetic activity.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565162,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":519},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":369,"entry":"@article{Hurst2005a,\n  title = {Thoughts about the Ventricular Gradient and Its Current Clinical Use},\n  author = {Hurst, J.

Wilson, a mathematical genius, believed that the calculation of the ventricular gradient yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The method of analysis was not utilized by clinicians at large because the concept was not easy to understand and because the method used to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient was so time consuming that clinicians could not use it. Grant utilized the concept to create vector electrocardiography, but he believed that if his method of analysis was used, it was not often necessary to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. He did, however, describe an easy way to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. The current major clinical use of the ventricular gradient is to identify primary and secondary T-wave abnormalities in an electrocardiogram showing left or right ventricular hypertrophy or left or right ventricular conduction abnormalities. In addition, the author uses the term ventricular time gradient instead of ventricular gradient in an effort to clarify the concept.

Methods and Results: TW-Ad was measured from standard digital 12-lead ECG in 5618 adults (46\\% men; age, 50.9±12.5 years) participating in the Health 2000 Study - an epidemiological survey representative of the Finnish adult population.

Lower TW-Ad was univariately associated with SCD (0.32±0.36 versus 0.60±0.19; P{$<$}0.001); it had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.809. TW-Ad (≤0.46) conferred a hazard ratio of 10.8 (95\\% confidence interval, 6.8-17.4; P{$<$}0.001) for SCD; it remained independently predictive of SCD after multivariable adjustment for clinical risk markers (hazard ratio, 4.6; 95\\% confidence interval, 2.7-7.4; P{$<$}0.001).

To test the hypothesis that HR variability is a predictor of long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the Holter tapes of 808 patients who survived AMI were analyzed. Heart rate variability was defined as the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in a 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram recording made 11 ± 3 days after AMI. In all patients demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were measured at baseline. Mean follow-up time was 31 months. Of all Holter variables measured, HR variability had the strongest univariate correlation with mortality. The relative risk of mortality was 5.3 times higher in the group with HR variability of less than 50 ms than the group with HR variability of more than 100 ms. HR variability remained a significant predictor of mortality after adjusting for clinical, demographic, other Holter features and ejection fraction.

Here, we aimed to determine the acceptable ECG sampling frequency range by analyzing ECG signals from patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute intoxication or overdose. Methods: The study included 83 adult patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute poisoning. The original 1,000-Hz ECG signals were down-sampled to 500-, 250-, 100-, and 50-Hz sampling frequencies with linear interpolation. R–R interval data were analyzed for time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters. Parameters derived from the data on down-sampled frequencies were compared with those derived from the data on 1,000-Hz signals, and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Down-sampling to 500 or 250 Hz resulted in excellent concordance. Signals down-sampled to 100 Hz produced acceptable results for time-domain analysis and Poincaré plots, but not for frequency-domain analysis. Down-sampling to 50 Hz proved to be unacceptable for both time-and frequency-domain analyses. At 50 Hz, the root-mean-squared successive differences and the power of high frequency tended to have high values and random errors. Conclusions: A 250-Hz sampling frequency would be acceptable for HRV analysis. When frequency-domain analysis is not required, a 100-Hz sampling frequency would also be acceptable.},\n  keywords = {Computer-assisted signal processing,Electrocardiography,Emergencies,Heart rate,Poisoning},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/UDNBWD95/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565277,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":526},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1040,"entry":"@article{Lampert2003a,\n  title = {Effects of {{Propranolol}} on Recovery of Heart Rate Variability Following Acute Myocardial Infarction and Relation to Outcome in the {{Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial}}},\n  author = {Lampert, Rachel and Ickovics, Jeannette R and Viscoli, Catherine J and Horwitz, Ralph I and Lee, Forrester A},\n  date = {2003},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Cardiology},\n  volume = {91},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {12521623},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {137--142},\n  issn = {00029149},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0002-9149(02)03098-9},\n  abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether β blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ± 0.1 to 5.17 ± 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 ± 0.09 to 4.77 ± 0.1 ms2, p {$<$}0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ± 0.24 to 3.86 ± 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ± 0.29 to 3.17 ± 0.23, p {$<$}0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which β blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. © 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},\n  isbn = {0002-9149},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/IERIAR3S/m-api-5780ebab-1ccc-5a63-06cd-a167d5ca21f9.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565277,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":527},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1146,"entry":"@article{Lehrer2003,\n  title = {Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Increases Baroreflex Gain and Peak Expiratory Flow},\n  author = {Lehrer, Paul M. and Vaschillo, Evgeny and Vaschillo, Bronya and Lu, Shou En and Eckberg, Dwain L. and Edelberg, Robert and Shih, Weichung Joe and Lin, Yong and Kuusela, Tom A. and Tahvanainen, Kari U.O. and Hamer, Robert M.},\n  date = {2003-09},\n  journaltitle = {Psychosomatic Medicine},\n  volume = {65},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {14508023},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {796--805},\n  issn = {00333174},\n  doi = {10.1097/01.PSY.0000089200.81962.19},\n  url = {http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00006842-200309000-00012},\n  urldate = {2014-11-22},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated heart rate variability biofeedback as a method for increasing vagal baroreflex gain and improving pulmonary function among 54 healthy adults.

RESULTS: We found acute increases in low-frequency and total spectrum heart rate variability, and in vagal baroreflex gain, correlated with slow breathing during biofeedback periods. Increased baseline baroreflex gain also occurred across sessions in the biofeedback group, independent of respiratory changes, and peak expiratory flow increased in this group, independently of cardiovascular changes. Biofeedback was accompanied by fewer adverse relaxation side effects than the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability biofeedback had strong long-term influences on resting baroreflex gain and pulmonary function.

High-frequency power relates to respiratory sinus arrhythmia and therefore to parasympathetic cardiovagal tone; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power to cardiac sympathetic innervation and function has been controversial. Alternatively, LF power might reflect baro reflexive modulation of autonomic outflows. We studied normal volunteers and chronic autonomic failure syndrome patients with and without loss of cardiac noradrenergic nerves to examine the relationships of LF power with cardiac sympathetic innervation and baroreflex function. We compared LF power of HRV in patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation, as indicated by low myocardial concentrations of 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or low rates of norepinephrine entry into coronary sinus plasma (cardiac norepinephrine spillover) to values in patients with intact innervation, at baseline, during infusion of yohimbine, which increases exocytotic norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, or during infusion of tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release. Baroreflex-cardiovagal slope (BRS) was calculated from the cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver. LF power was unrelated to myocardial 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the log of LF power correlated positively with the log of BRS (r = 0.72, {$<$} 0.0001). Patients with a low BRS (‚â§3 msec/mm Hg) had low LF power, regardless of cardiac innervation. Tyramine and yohimbine increased LF power in subjects with normal BRS but not in those with low BRS. BRS at baseline predicted LF responses to tyramine and yohimbine.

Early intervention with antibiotics improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015. PATIENTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively.None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation cohorts was indistinguishable.

Forty-four studies met the pre-set inclusion criteria involving 21,438 participants. Values for short-term HRV measures from the literature were lower than Task Force norms. A degree of homogeneity for common measures of HRV in healthy adults was shown across studies. A number of studies demonstrate large interindividual variations (up to 260,000\\%), particularly for spectral measures. A number of methodological discrepancies underlined disparate values. These include a systematic failure within the literature (a) to recognize the importance of RR data recognition/editing procedures and (b) to question disparate HRV values observed in normally healthy individuals. A need for large-scale population studies and a review of the Task Force recommendations for short-term HRV that covers the full-age spectrum were identified. Data presented should be used to quantify reference ranges for short-term measures of HRV in healthy adult populations but should be undertaken with reference to methodological factors underlying disparate values.

Results of this study indicate that the intracellular agents from these species with proliferative enteritis have high sequence similarity, indicating that they are all in the genus Lawsonia and that they may also be the same species, L. intracellularis.},\n  isbn = {0020-7713},\n  keywords = {circadian,DIAMOND MI study,Heart rate variability,Multipoles,Recurrence plot},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GC6HCAFP/2005 - Olesen et al. - Statistical analysis of the DIAMOND MI study by the multipole method.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565281,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":537},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2142,"entry":"@article{Pastori2020,\n  title = {Clinical Phenotypes of Atrial Fibrillation and Risk of Mortality: A Cluster Analysis},\n  author = {Pastori, D and Antonucci, E and Milanese, A and Violi, F and Pignatelli, P and Palareti, G and Farcomeni, A},\n  date = {2020-11-01},\n  journaltitle = {European Heart Journal},\n  volume = {41},\n  issn = {0195-668X},\n  doi = {10.1093/ehjci/ehaa946.2893},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/doi/10.1093/ehjci/ehaa946.2893/6004272},\n  issue = {Supplement\\_2},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/PBFTWDBS/pastori-2020-af-cluster-analysis.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565281,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":538},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1743,"entry":"@article{Perez-Alday2019,\n  title = {Importance of the Heart Vector Origin Point Definition for an {{ECG}} Analysis: {{The Atherosclerosis Risk}} in {{Communities}} ({{ARIC}}) Study},\n  author = {Perez-Alday, Erick Andres and Li-Pershing, Yin and Bender, Aron and Hamilton, Christopher and Thomas, Jason A. and Johnson, Kyle and Lee, Tiffany L. and Gonzales, Ryan and Li, Aaron and Newton, Kelley and Tereshchenko, Larisa G.},\n  date = {2019-01-01},\n  journaltitle = {Computers in Biology and Medicine},\n  volume = {104},\n  eprint = {30472495},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {127--138},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier Ltd}},\n  issn = {18790534},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.11.013},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010482518303755},\n  urldate = {2020-11-12},\n  abstract = {Aim: Our goal was to investigate the effect of a global XYZ median beat construction and the heart vector origin point definition on predictive accuracy of ECG biomarkers of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk In Community study participants with analyzable digital ECGs were included (n = 15,768; 55\\% female, 73\\% white, mean age 54.2 ± 5.8 y). We developed an algorithm to automatically detect the heart vector origin point on a median beat. Three different approaches to construct a global XYZ beat and two methods to locate origin point were compared. Global electrical heterogeneity was measured by sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST), spatial QRS-T angle, and spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) magnitude, azimuth, and elevation. Adjudicated SCD served as the primary outcome. Results: There was high intra-observer (kappa 0.972) and inter-observer (kappa 0.984) agreement in a heart vector origin definition between an automated algorithm and a human. QRS was wider in a median beat that was constructed using R-peak alignment than in time-coherent beat (88.1 ± 16.7 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P {$<$} 0.0001), and on a median beat constructed using QRS-onset as a zeroed baseline, vs. isoelectric origin point (86.7 ± 15.9 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P {$<$} 0.0001). ROC AUC was significantly larger for QRS, QT, peak QRS-T angle, SVG elevation, and SAI QRST if measured on a time-coherent median beat, and for SAI QRST and SVG magnitude if measured on a median beat using isoelectric origin point. Conclusion: Time-coherent global XYZ median beat with physiologically meaningful definition of the heart vector's origin point improved predictive accuracy of SCD biomarkers.},\n  keywords = {Electrocardiography,Electrocardiology,Median beat,Origin point,Sudden cardiac death,Vectorcardiogram,Vectorcardiography},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/4DCZ7UPD/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565281,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":539},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1505,"entry":"@article{Raghupathi2014,\n  title = {Big Data Analytics in Healthcare: Promise and Potential},\n  author = {Raghupathi, Wullianallur and Raghupathi, Viju},\n  date = {2014-12-07},\n  journaltitle = {Health Information Science and Systems},\n  volume = {2},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {25825667},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1--10},\n  publisher = {{Springer Nature}},\n  issn = {2047-2501},\n  doi = {10.1186/2047-2501-2-3},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the promise and potential of big data analytics in healthcare.

Materials and Methods: Data are standardized using percentile ranking of autonomic proxies from a relatively large reference population (n = 1593, age 39 ± 13 years). Autonomic indices are obtained from autoregressive spectral analysis of (ECG derived) HRV at rest and during standing up. A reduced ANSI (using RR, RR variance and rest–stand difference of LFnu) is then constructed as a radar plot, quantified according to its combined area and tested against different risk subgroups. Results: With growing risk profile, there is a marked reduction of the rank value of ANSI, quantified individually by the radar plot area. The practical usefulness of the approach was tested in small groups of additional subjects putatively characterized by elevated or poor autonomic performance. Data show that elite endurance athletes are characterized by elevated values of ANSI (80·6 ± 14·9, P {$<$} 0·001) while subjects with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes show lower values (DM1 = 37·0 ± 18·9 and DM2 = 26·8 ± 23·3, P = 0·002), and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) represent a nadir (17 ± 20, P {$<$} 0·001). Conclusions: This observational study shows the feasibility of testing simpler metrics of cardiac autonomic regulation based on a multivariate unitary index in a preventive setting. This simple approach might foster a wider application of HRV in the clinical arena, and permit an easier appreciation of autonomic performance.},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,BMI,cardiometabolic risk,hypertension,personal prevention,smoke},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/HNUUBVA2/2017_Sala et al._A composite autonomic index as unitary metric for heart rate variability a proof of concept.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565307,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":546},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1935,"entry":"@article{Sassi2015,\n  title = {Advances in Heart Rate Variability Signal Analysis: {{Joint}} Position Statement by the e-{{Cardiology ESC Working Group}} and the {{European Heart Rhythm Association}} Co-Endorsed by the {{Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society}}},\n  author = {Sassi, Roberto and Cerutti, Sergio and Lombardi, Federico and Malik, Marek and Huikuri, Heikki V. and Peng, Chung Kang and Schmidt, Georg and Yamamoto, Yoshiharu},\n  date = {2015-09},\n  journaltitle = {Europace},\n  volume = {17},\n  number = {9},\n  eprint = {26177817},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1341--1353},\n  issn = {15322092},\n  doi = {10.1093/europace/euv015},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/europace/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/europace/euv015},\n  urldate = {2019-02-04},\n  abstract = {Following the publication of the Task Force document on heart rate variability (HRV) in 1996, a number of articles have been published to describe new HRV methodologies and their application in different physiological and clinical studies. This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning. Multidisciplinary dialogue and specialized courses in the combination of clinical cardiology and complex signal processing methods seem warranted for further advances in studies of cardiac oscillations and in the understanding normal and abnormal cardiac control processes.},\n  isbn = {1532-2092 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r1099-5129 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,Entropy,Fractal signals,Heart rate variability,Nonlinear dynamics,Risk stratification,Signal analysis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/8LCZAI9V/2015_Sassi et al._Advances in heart rate variability signal analysis Joint position statement by the e-Cardiology ESC Working Group a(2).pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565311,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":547},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":695,"entry":"@article{Saul1990,\n  title = {Beat-{{To-Beat Variations}} of {{Heart Rate Reflect Modulation}} of {{Cardiac Autonomic Outflow}}},\n  author = {family=Saul, given=JP, given-i=JP},\n  date = {1990},\n  journaltitle = {Physiology},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {32--37},\n  issn = {1548-9213},\n  doi = {10.1152/physiologyonline.1990.5.1.32},\n  url = {http://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/physiologyonline.1990.5.1.32},\n  urldate = {2018-10-03},\n  abstract = {JP Saul ABSTRACT What is most intriguing about heart rate (HR) variability is that there is so much of it.

Heart rate variability is a noninvasive tool to quantitatively estimate cardiac autonomic activity and has been used to document decreased cardiac autonomic activity in hypertension. The ability of decreased heart rate variability to predict incident hypertension has not been well studied, and there are no studies of whether hypertension leads to changes in heart rate variability. We investigated the temporal sequence linking hypertension, blood pressure, and heart rate variability in a population-based cohort of 11 061 individuals aged 45 to 54 years at baseline. Individuals with hypertension had decreased heart rate variability at baseline, and this association was present across the full blood pressure range. Among 7099 individuals without hypertension at baseline, low heart rate variability predicted greater risk of incident hypertension over 9 years of follow-up.

Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24\\,h, short-term (\\textasciitilde 5\\,min), and ultra-short-term ({$<$}5\\,min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from \\textasciitilde 2\\,min to 24\\,h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24\\,h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},\n  isbn = {2296-2565; 2296-2565},\n  keywords = {biofeedback,complexity,heart rate variability,non-linear measurements,normative values,optimal performance},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/2K76RC6I/2017 - Shaffer, Ginsberg - An Overview of Heart Rate Variability Metrics and Norms.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565332,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":551},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1509,"entry":"@article{Shah2016a,\n  title = {An Electrocardiogram-Based Risk Equation for Incident Cardiovascular Disease from the {{National Health}} and {{Nutrition Examination Survey}}},\n  author = {Shah, Amit J. and Vaccarino, Viola and Janssens, A.

Interval and vector data that are commonly available on modern ECGs may offer independent prognostic information that improves risk classification. OBJECTIVES: To derive and validate a CVD risk equation based on ECG metrics and to determine its incremental benefit in addition to the Framingham risk score (FRS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study included 3640 randomly selected community-based adults aged 40 to 74 years without known CVD from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) cohort (1971-1975) and 6329 from the NHANES III cohort (1988-1994). Participants were sampled from across the United States. A risk score to assess incident nonfatal and fatal CVD events was derived based on computer-generated ECG data, including frontal P, R, and T axes; heart rate; and PR, QRS, and QT intervals from NHANES I. The most prognostic variables, along with age and sex, were incorporated into the NHANES ECG risk equation. The equation was evaluated in the NHANES III cohort for an independent validation. Follow-up in the NHANES III cohort was completed on December 31, 2006. Data for this study were analyzed from August 11, 2015, to May 20, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was CVD death. Secondary outcomes included 10-year ischemic heart disease and all-cause death. RESULTS: The final study sample included 9969 participants (4714 men [47.3\\%]; 5255 women [52.7\\%]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [10.1] years) from both cohorts. Frontal T axis, heart rate, and heart rate–corrected QT interval were the most significant ECG factors in the NHANES I cohort. In the validation cohort (NHANES III), the equation provided for prognostic information for fatal CVD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95\\% CI, 2.82-3.72); the C statistic was 0.79 (95\\% CI, 0.76-0.81). When added to the FRS in Cox proportional hazards regression models, the categorical (1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% cutoffs) net reclassification improvement was 24\\%. When the FRS and ECG scores were combined in a single model, the C statistic improved by 0.04 (95\\% CI, 0.02-0.06) to 0.80 (95\\% CI, 0.77-0.82). Similar improvements were noted when the ECG score was added to the pooled cohort equation. When the equation for prognostic information about ischemic heart disease and all-cause death was evaluated, the results were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An ECG risk score based on age, sex, heart rate, frontal T axis, and QT interval assesses the risk for CVD and compares favorably with the FRS alone in an independent cohort of asymptomatic individuals. Although the ECG risk equation is low cost, further research is needed to ascertain whether this additional step in risk stratification may improve prevention efforts and reduce CVD events.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GCW43MJU/2016 - Shah et al. - An electrocardiogram-based risk equation for incident cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrit(2).pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565337,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":552},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":657,"entry":"@article{Sinnreich1998,\n  title = {Five Minute Recordings of Heart Rate Variability for Population Studies: {{Repeatability}} and Age-Sex Characteristics},\n  author = {Sinnreich, R and Kark, J D and Friedlander, Y and Sapoznikov, D and Luria, M H},\n  date = {1998},\n  journaltitle = {Heart},\n  volume = {80},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {156--162},\n  issn = {13556037},\n  doi = {10.1136/hrt.80.2.156},\n  url = {http://heart.bmj.com/},\n  urldate = {2019-04-18},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stability of short recordings of heart rate variability (HRV) with time, and the association of HRV with age and sex. DESIGN: Five minute Holter recordings were made twice over a two month interval (tracking study). In addition, HRV was measured in a cross sectional study. SETTING: Residents of 11 Israeli kibbutzim were examined in their settlements. SUBJECTS: 32 men and 38 women (aged 31-67) participated in the tracking study and 294 (aged 35-65) were involved in the cross sectional study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time and frequency domain analyses on Holter recordings were undertaken in two breathing conditions: spontaneous and controlled breathing (15 respirations per minute). Regression was used to assess the relations of sex, age, heart rate, and logarithmically transformed HRV indices. RESULTS: HRV measures were highly consistent with time with correlations of 0.76-0.80 for high frequency and total power.

Traditional HRV predicts mortality in patients with a range of times post-MI, but the association of nonlinear HRV and outcome in this population is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: HRV was determined from 740 tapes recorded before antiarrhythmic therapy in Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial patients with ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) suppressed on the first randomized treatment. Patients were 70 +/- 121 days post-MI. Follow up was 362 +/- 241 days (70 deaths). The association between traditional time and frequency-domain HRV and mortality and nonlinear HRV and mortality were compared for the entire population (ALL), those without coronary artery bypass graft post-MI (no CABG), and those without CABG or diabetes (no CABG, no DIAB) using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Strength of association was compared by P values and Wald Chi-square values. Nonlinear HRV included short-term fractal scaling exponent, power law slope, and SD12 (Poincare dimension). For ALL and for no CABG, increased daytime SD12 had the strongest association with mortality (P=0.002 ALL and P {$<$}0.001 no CABG). For no CABG, no DIAB increased 24-hour SD12 hours had the strongest association (P {$<$}0.001) with mortality. Upon multivariate analysis, increased SD12, decreased ln ULF (ultra low frequency), and history of prior MI and history of congestive heart failure each remained in the model. CONCLUSION: Nonlinear HRV is associated with mortality post-MI. However, as with traditional HRV, this is diluted by CABG surgery post-MI and by diabetes. Results suggest that decreased long-term HRV and increased randomness of heart rate are each independent risk factors for mortality post-MI.},\n  isbn = {3142861394},\n  keywords = {Ambulatory ECG,Heart rate variability,Postmyocardial infarction,Risk factors},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Q4G5955A/2005 - Stein et al. - Traditional and nonlinear heart rate variability are each independently associated with mortality after myocardial.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565350,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":554},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1774,"entry":"@inproceedings{Tanev2014,\n  title = {Classification of Acute Stress Using Linear and Non-Linear Heart Rate Variability Analysis Derived from Sternal {{ECG}}},\n  booktitle = {2014 36th {{Annual International Conference}} of the {{IEEE Engineering}} in {{Medicine}} and {{Biology Society}}, {{EMBC}} 2014},\n  author = {Tanev, George and Saadi, Dorthe B. and Hoppe, Karsten and Sorensen, Helge B.D.},\n  date = {2014-11-02},\n  volume = {2014},\n  eprint = {25570717},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {3386--3389},\n  publisher = {{Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.}},\n  doi = {10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944349},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25570717/},\n  urldate = {2021-03-15},\n  abstract = {Chronic stress detection is an important factor in predicting and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The physiological basis for such oscillations is unclear. In our study, we used blocking drugs to evaluate potential contributions of sympathetic and vagal mechanisms and the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system to very-low-frequency RR-interval variability in 10 young healthy subjects. Methods and Results-We recorded RR intervals and arterial pressures during three separate sessions, with the patient in supine and 40 degree upright tilt positions, during 20-minute frequency (0.25 Hz) and tidal volume-controlled breathing after intravenous injections: saline (control), atenolol (0.2 mg/kg, β-adrenergic blockade), atropine sulfate (0.04 mg/kg, parasympathetic blockade), atenolol and atropine (complete autonomic blockade), and enalaprilat (0.02 mg/kg, ACE blockade). We integrated fast Fourier transform RR-interval spectral power at very low (0.003 to 0.03 Hz), low (0.05 to 0.15 Hz), and respiratory (0.2 to 0.3 Hz) frequencies. β- Adrenergic blockade had no significant effect on very-low-or low-frequency RR-interval power but increased respiratory frequency power 2-fold. ACE blockade had no significant effect on low or respiratory frequency RR- interval power but modestly (\\textasciitilde{} 21.\\%) increased very-low-frequency power in the supine (but not upright tilt) position (P{$<$}0.05). The most profound effects were exerted by parasympathetic blockade: Atropine, given alone or with atenolol, abolished nearly all RR-interval variability and decreased very-low-frequency variability by 92\\%. Conclusions-Although very-low- frequency heart period rhythms are influenced by the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, as low and respiratory frequency RR-interval rhythms, they depend primarily on the presence of parasympathetic outflow. Therefore the prognostic value of very-low-frequency heart period oscillations may derive from the fundamental importance of parasympathetic mechanisms in cardiovascular health.},\n  keywords = {adrenergic,beta,Heart rate,Receptors,Renin,Vagus nerve},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/IUUWRYLX/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565361,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":557},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1562,"entry":"@article{Tereshchenko2011,\n  title = {A New Electrocardiogram Marker to Identify Patients at Low Risk for Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias: {{Sum}} Magnitude of the Absolute {{QRST}} Integral},\n  author = {Tereshchenko, Larisa G and Cheng, Alan and Fetics, Barry J and Butcher, Barbara and Marine, Joseph E and Spragg, David D and Sinha, Sunil and Dalal, Darshan and Calkins, Hugh and Tomaselli, Gordon F and Berger, Ronald D},\n  date = {2011},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Electrocardiology},\n  volume = {44},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {208--216},\n  issn = {00220736},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2010.08.012},\n  url = {www.jecgonline.com},\n  urldate = {2020-05-19},\n  abstract = {Objective: We proposed and tested a novel electrocardiogram marker of risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs).

In this paper, we review our novel method in the historical context.},\n  keywords = {Frequency content,Vectorcardiogram},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/CNGT8K7D/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565379,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":559},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1556,"entry":"@inproceedings{Tereshchenko2018a,\n  title = {Global {{Electrical Heterogeneity}}: {{Mechanisms}} and {{Clinical Significance}}},\n  booktitle = {Computing in {{Cardiology}}},\n  author = {Tereshchenko, Larisa G.},\n  date = {2018-09-01},\n  volume = {2018-Septe},\n  publisher = {{IEEE Computer Society}},\n  issn = {2325887X},\n  doi = {10.22489/CinC.2018.165},\n  abstract = {This review summarizes recent findings and discusses a clinical significance of a vectorcardiographic (VCG) Global electrical heterogeneity (GEH).

However, the optimal way to target stimulation and administer TMS therapies, for example, where and in which electric field direction the stimuli should be given, is yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To develop an automated closed-loop system for adjusting TMS parameters (in this work, the stimulus orientation) online based on TMS-evoked brain activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: We developed an automated closed-loop TMS-EEG set-up. In this set-up, the stimulus parameters are electronically adjusted with multi-locus TMS. As a proof of concept, we developed an algorithm that automatically optimizes the stimulation orientation based on single-trial EEG responses. We applied the algorithm to determine the electric field orientation that maximizes the amplitude of the TMS-EEG responses. The validation of the algorithm was performed with six healthy volunteers, repeating the search twenty times for each subject. RESULTS: The validation demonstrated that the closed-loop control worked as desired despite the large variation in the single-trial EEG responses. We were often able to get close to the orientation that maximizes the EEG amplitude with only a few tens of pulses.

We hypothesized that parallel advances in computing power, machine learning algorithms, and availability of large-scale data could substantially expand the clinical inferences derived from the ECG while at the same time preserving interpretability for medical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 36 186 ECGs from the University of California, San Francisco database that would enable training of models for estimation of cardiac structure or function or detection of disease. We segmented the ECG into standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864 measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates, with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6\\% for heart rate and 4\\% for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16\\% and 19\\%, respectively) with good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as binary traits. Model performance using our approach for disease detection demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, 0.91 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.86 for cardiac amyloid, and 0.77 for mitral valve prolapse.

Although the investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been prevalent for several decades, the methods used for preprocessing, windowing, and choosing appropriate parameters lacks consensus among academic and clinical investigators. Moreover, many of the important steps are omitted from publications, preventing reproducibility. To address this, we have compiled a comprehensive and open-source modular toolbox for calculating HRV metrics and other related variability indices, on both raw cardiovascular time series, and RR intervals. The software, known as the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox, is implemented in the MATLAB programming language, with standard (open) input and output formats, and requires no external libraries. The functioning of our software is compared with other widely used and referenced HRV toolboxes to identify important differences. Our findings demonstrate how modest differences in the approach to HRV analysis can lead to divergent results, a factor that might have contributed to the lack of repeatability of studies and clinical applicability of HRV metrics. Existing HRV toolboxes do not include standardized preprocessing, signal quality indices (for noisy segment removal), and abnormal rhythm detection and are therefore likely to lead to significant errors in the presence of moderate to high noise or arrhythmias. We therefore describe the inclusion of validated tools to address these issues. We also make recommendations for default values and testing/reporting.},\n  isbn = {2514599342},\n  keywords = {heart rate variability,peak detection,physiological signal processing,toolbox validation}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565397,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":564},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2141,"entry":"@article{Vitolo2021,\n  title = {Clinical {{Phenotype Classification}} of {{Atrial Fibrillation Patients Using Cluster Analysis}} and {{Associations}} with {{Trial-Adjudicated Outcomes}}},\n  author = {Vitolo, Marco and Proietti, Marco and Shantsila, Alena and Boriani, Giuseppe and Lip, Gregory Y.

We aimed to identify different groups of AF patients who shared common clinical phenotypes using cluster analysis and evaluate the association between identified clusters and clinical outcomes. Methods: We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis in AF patients from AMADEUS and BOREALIS trials. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke/thromboembolism (TE), cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction, and/or all-cause death. Individual components of the primary outcome and major bleeding were also assessed. Results: We included 3980 AF patients treated with the Vitamin-K Antagonist from the AMADEUS and BOREALIS studies. The analysis identified four clusters in which patients varied significantly among clinical characteristics. Cluster 1 was characterized by patients with low rates of CV risk factors and comorbidities; Cluster 2 was characterized by patients with a high burden of CV risk factors; Cluster 3 consisted of patients with a high burden of CV comorbidities; Cluster 4 was characterized by the highest rates of non-CV comorbidities. After a mean follow-up of 365 (standard deviation 187) days, Cluster 4 had the highest cumulative risk of outcomes. Compared with Cluster 1, Cluster 4 was independently associated with an increased risk for the composite outcome (hazard ratio (HR) 2.43, 95\\% confidence interval (CI) 1.70–3.46), all-cause death (HR 2.35, 95\\% CI 1.58–3.49) and major bleeding (HR 2.18, 95\\% CI 1.19–3.96). Conclusions: Cluster analysis identified four different clinically relevant phenotypes of AF patients that had unique clinical characteristics and different outcomes. Cluster analysis highlights the high degree of heterogeneity in patients with AF, suggesting the need for a phenotype-driven approach to comorbidities, which could provide a more holistic approach to management aimed to improve patients’ outcomes.{$<$}/p{$>$}}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565401,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":565},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1476,"entry":"@article{Waks2016,\n  title = {Global Electrical Heterogeneity: {{A}} Review of the Spatial Ventricular Gradient},\n  author = {Waks, Jonathan W and Tereshchenko, Larisa G},\n  date = {2016},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Electrocardiology},\n  volume = {49},\n  number = {6},\n  pages = {824--830},\n  issn = {15328430},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2016.07.025},\n  url = {www.sciencedirect.comhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2016.07.0250022-0736/},\n  urldate = {2020-03-30},\n  abstract = {The ventricular gradient, an electrocardiographic concept calculated by integrating the area under the QRS complex and T-wave, represents the degree and direction of myocardial electrical heterogeneity.

Cox proportional hazards and competing risks models evaluated associations between GEH electrocardiographic parameters and SCD. An SCD competing risks score was derived from demographics, comorbidities, and GEH parameters. SCD incidence was 1.86 per 1000 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, baseline GEH parameters and large increases in GEH parameters over time were independently associated with SCD. Final SCD risk scores included age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and GEH parameters as continuous variables. When GEH parameters were added to clinical/demographic factors, the C statistic increased from 0.777 to 0.790 (P=0.008), the risk score classified 10-year SCD risk as high ({$>$}5\\%) in 7.2\\% of participants, 10\\% of SCD victims were appropriately reclassified into a high-risk category, and only 1.4\\% of SCD victims were inappropriately reclassified from high to intermediate risk.

Data exported from these systems is stored in proprietary formats which are challenging to access and storage-space inefficient. No previous work has made available an open-source platform for parsing and interrogating this data in a standardized format. We therefore sought to develop a standardized, open-source data structure and associated computer code to store electroanatomic mapping data in a space-efficient and easily accessible manner. Methods: A data structure was defined capturing the available anatomic and electrical data. OpenEP, implemented in MATLAB, was developed to parse and interrogate this data. Functions are provided for analysis of chamber geometry, activation mapping, conduction velocity mapping, voltage mapping, ablation sites, and electrograms as well as visualization and input/output functions. Performance benchmarking for data import and storage was performed. Data import and analysis validation was performed for chamber geometry, activation mapping, voltage mapping and ablation representation. Finally, systematic analysis of electrophysiology literature was performed to determine the suitability of OpenEP for contemporary electrophysiology research. Results: The average time to parse clinical datasets was 400 ± 162 s per patient. OpenEP data was two orders of magnitude smaller than compressed clinical data (OpenEP: 20.5 ± 8.7 Mb, vs clinical: 1.46 ± 0.77 Gb). OpenEP-derived geometry metrics were correlated with the same clinical metrics (Area: R2 = 0.7726, P {$<$} 0.0001; Volume: R2 = 0.5179, P {$<$} 0.0001). Investigating the cause of systematic bias in these correlations revealed OpenEP to outperform the clinical platform in recovering accurate values. Both activation and voltage mapping data created with OpenEP were correlated with clinical values (mean voltage R2 = 0.8708, P {$<$} 0.001; local activation time R2 = 0.8892, P {$<$} 0.0001). OpenEP provides the processing necessary for 87 of 92 qualitatively assessed analysis techniques (95\\%) and 119 of 136 quantitatively assessed analysis techniques (88\\%) in a contemporary cohort of mapping studies. Conclusions: We present the OpenEP framework for evaluating electroanatomic mapping data. OpenEP provides the core functionality necessary to conduct electroanatomic mapping research. We demonstrate that OpenEP is both space-efficient and accurately representative of the original data. We show that OpenEP captures the majority of data required for contemporary electroanatomic mapping-based electrophysiology research and propose a roadmap for future development.},\n  keywords = {ablation electrophysiology,atrial fibrillation,conduction velocity,contact force,data storage and retrieval,electroanatomic mapping,electrophysiology – arrhythmia mapping and ablatio},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/9BESR99P/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686705565423,"version":0,"updated":1686708182890},"$loki":569},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":655,"entry":"@article{Woo1992,\n  title = {Patterns of Beat-to-Beat Heart Rate Variability in Advanced Heart Failure},\n  author = {Woo, Mary A. and Stevenson, William G. and Moser, Debra K. and Trelease, Robert B. and Harper, Ronald M.},\n  date = {1992-03-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Heart Journal},\n  volume = {123},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {1539521},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {704--710},\n  publisher = {{Mosby}},\n  issn = {10976744},\n  doi = {10.1016/0002-8703(92)90510-3},\n  url = {https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/science/article/pii/0002870392905103?via%3Dihub},\n  urldate = {2018-07-29},\n  abstract = {Diminished heart rate variability is associated with high sympathetic tone and an increased mortality rate in heart failure cases. We constructed Poincaré plots of each sinus R-R interval plotted against the subsequent R-R interval from 24-hour Holter recordings of 24 healthy subjects (control group) and 24 patients with heart failure. Every subject in the control group had a comet-shaped Poincaré plot resulting from an increase in beat-to-beat dispersion as heart rate slowed. No patient with heart failure had this comet-shaped pattern. Instead, three distinctive patterns were identified: (1) a torpedo-shaped pattern resulting from low R-R interval dispersion over the entire range of heart rates, (2) a fanshaped pattern resulting from restriction of overall R-R interval ranges with enhanced dispersion, and (3) complex patterns with clusters of points characteristic of stepwise changes in R-R intervals.

However, rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) drives their beating, even in the absence of autonomic neural input. Objective To test how this rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells interacts with autonomic impulses to the heart beating interval variability in vivo. Methods We analyzed beating interval variability in time and frequency domains and by fractal and entropy analyses: (1) in vivo, when the brain input to the SAN is intact; (2) during autonomic denervation in vivo; (3) in isolated SAN tissue (ie, in which the autonomic neural input is completely absent); (4) in single pacemaker cells isolated from the SAN; and (5) after autonomic receptor stimulation of these cells. Results Spontaneous beating intervals of pacemaker cells residing in the isolated SAN tissue exhibit fractal-like behavior and have lower approximate entropy compared with those in the intact heart. Isolation of pacemaker cells from SAN tissue, however, leads to a loss in the beating interval order and fractal-like behavior. β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of isolated pacemaker cells increases intrinsic clock synchronization, decreases their action potential period, and increases system complexity.

Therefore, we developed an automatic classification system to distinguish five geometric patterns of the Poincare plots from four types of cardiac arrhythmias. The statistics features are designed on measurements and an ensemble classifier of three types of neural networks is proposed. Aiming at the difficulty to set a proper threshold for classifying the multiple categories, the threshold selection strategy is analyzed. 24 h ECG monitoring recordings from 674 patients, which have four types of cardiac arrhythmias, are adopted for recognition.

Such networks work together with exquisite temporal precision to generate each action potential and contraction. Macromolecular complexes play crucial roles in transcription, translation, oligomerization, trafficking, membrane retention, glycosylation, post-translational modification, turnover, function, and degradation of all cardiac ion channels known to date.

Objectives This study sought to study the association between HRV and risk of AF. Methods This study included 11,715 middle-aged adults in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) cohort with heart rate and HRV measures obtained from 2-min electrocardiogram recordings performed at baseline (1987 to 1989). These measures included SD of normal-to-normal RR intervals, high-frequency (HF) (0.15 to 0.40 Hz), low-frequency (0.04 to 0.15 Hz), and the low-frequency/HF ratio (denoting a greater sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance). Incident AF cases were ascertained by electrocardiogram at ARIC follow-up visits, hospital discharge diagnosis, or death certificates through 2011. Results During an average follow-up of 19.4 years, 1,580 or 13.5\\% of participants developed AF. A baseline heart rate {$<$}60 beats/min was associated modestly with an increased risk of AF. Lower overall HRV as well as increased sympathetic/parasympathetic tone were associated independently with a higher risk of AF; the hazard ratio for each 1 SD lower SD of normal-to-normal RR intervals was 1.14 (95\\% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.21), for HF was 1.12 (95\\% confidence interval: 1.06 to 1.17), and for low frequency/HF was 1.08 (95\\% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.14). Conclusions Cardiac autonomic dysfunction denoted by low resting short-term HRV was associated with higher AF incidence. A low heart rate may be associated with higher AF risk.

Schruers, Klaus Wiedemann, Cüneyt Demiralay Abstract Background The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are considered to play the most crucial role in the pathophysiology of stress responsiveness and are increasingly studied together. However, only few studies have simultaneously assessed HPA axis and ANS activity to investigate their direct interaction in pathophysiology, while no study so far has assessed the dynamic interplay between the two systems in healthy subjects through endocrine challenges. Methods The present study assessed the direct effects of overnight pharmacoendocrine HPA axis challenges with dexamethasone (suppression) and metyrapone (stimulation) on ANS activity at rest as determined by linear and nonlinear measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in 39 young healthy individuals. Results Findings indicated significant effects of metyrapone, but not dexamethasone on autonomic activity at rest based on HRV measures. HRV after metyrapone was overall significantly reduced in comparison to baseline or post-dexamethasone conditions, while the combined metyrapone-related reduction of HRV measures RMSSD, NN50(\\%) and HF(\\%) with concomitant increase of the unifractal scaling coefficient αfast value jointly indicated a specifically diminished vagal activity. Conclusions We provide first data that HPA axis stimulation (metyrapone) is associated with reduced vagal tone, while HPA axis suppression (dexamethasone) has no effect on autonomic modulation of heart function. Our results support a vital role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the interplay between ANS and HPA axis and, thus, in the modulation of stress-related cardiovascular responsiveness and the susceptibility to stress-related disorders.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162177,"version":0},"$loki":577},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1209,"entry":"@article{Ajijola2015a,\n  title = {Augmentation of Cardiac Sympathetic Tone by Percutaneous Low-Level Stellate Ganglion Stimulation in Humans: {{A}} Feasibility Study},\n  author = {Ajijola, Olujimi A. and Howard-Quijano, Kimberly and Scovotti, Jennifer and Vaseghi, Marmar and Lee, Christine and Mahajan, Aman and Shivkumar, Kalyanam},\n  date = {2015-03-01},\n  journaltitle = {Physiological Reports},\n  volume = {3},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {e12328},\n  publisher = {{John Wiley \\& Sons, Ltd}},\n  issn = {2051817X},\n  doi = {10.14814/phy2.12328},\n  url = {http://doi.wiley.com/10.14814/phy2.12328},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  abstract = {© 2015 The Authors. Modulation of human cardiac mechanical and electrophysiologic function by direct s tellate ganglion stimulation has not been performed. Our aim was to assess the effect of low-level left stellate ganglion (LSG) stimulation (SGS) on arrhythmias, hemodynamic, and cardiac electrophysiological indices. Patients undergoing ablation procedures for arrhythmias were recruited for SGS. A stimulating electrode was placed next to the LSG under fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging; and SGS (5–10 Hz, 10–20 mA) was performed. We measured hemodynamic, intracardiac and ECG parameters, and activation recovery intervals (ARIs) (surrogate for action potential duration) from a duodecapolar catheter in the right ventricular outflow tract. Five patients underwent SGS (3 males, 45 ± 20 years). Stimulating catheter placement was successful, and without complication in all patients. SGS did not change heart rate, but increased mean arterial blood pressure (78 ± 3 mmHg to 98 ± 5 mmHg, P {$<$} 0.001) and dP/dt max (1148 ± 244 mmHg/sec to 1645 ± 493 mmHg/sec, P = 0.03). SGS shortened mean ARI from 304 ± 23 msec to 283 ± 17 msec (P {$<$} 0.001), although one patient required parasympathetic blockade. Dispersion of repolarization (DOR) increased in four patients and decreased in one, consistent with animal models. QT interval, T-wave duration and amplitude at baseline and with SGS were 415 ± 15 msec versus 399 ± 15 msec (P {$<$} 0.001); 201 ± 12 msec versus 230 ± 28 msec; and 0.2 ± 0.09 mV versus 0.22 ± 0.08 mV, respectively. At the level of SGS performed, no increase in arrhythmias was seen. Percutaneous low-level SGS shortens ARI in the RVOT, and increases blood pressure and LV contractility. These observations demonstrate feasibility of percutaneous SGS in humans.},\n  keywords = {Activation recovery interval,Arrhythmias,Stellate ganglion,Sympathetic stimulation}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162187,"version":0},"$loki":578},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1072,"entry":"@article{Akdemir2016a,\n  title = {Vagus Nerve Stimulation: {{An}} Evolving Adjunctive Treatment for Cardiac Disease},\n  author = {Akdemir, Barış and Benditt, David G.},\n  date = {2016},\n  journaltitle = {Anatolian Journal of Cardiology},\n  volume = {16},\n  number = {10},\n  eprint = {27723668},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {804--810},\n  publisher = {{Turkish Society of Cardiology}},\n  issn = {21492271},\n  doi = {10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2016.7129},\n  abstract = {The vagus nerve is a major component of the autonomic nervous system and plays a critical role in many body functions including for example, speech, swallowing, heart rate and respiratory control, gastric secretion, and intestinal motility.

When, instead, different combinations of weekday and weekend sleep durations were analysed, we observed a detrimental association with consistently sleeping ≤5~hr (hazard ratios 1.65; 95\\% confidence intervals 1.22?2.23) or ≥8~hr (hazard ratios 1.25; 95\\% confidence intervals 1.05?1.50), compared with consistently sleeping 6?7~hr per day (reference). The mortality rate among participants with short sleep during weekdays, but long sleep during weekends, did not differ from the rate of the reference group. Among individuals ≥65~years old, no association between weekend sleep or weekday/weekend sleep durations and mortality was observed. In conclusion, short, but not long, weekend sleep was associated with an increased mortality in subjects {$<$}65~years.

To investigate this, we acutely silenced the vagal preganglio-nic neurones in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DVMN) in a rat model using a pharmogenetic approach, and we used the triple-synuclein-null mice as a model of autonomic dysfunction associated with chronic reduction of vagal tone. Methods: In 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (380-420g), lentiviral vectors were used to transduce DVMN neurones to express an inhibitory Gi-protein-coupled Drosophila allatostatin receptor (AlstR) or green fluorescent protein as a control. Application of a natural ligand of AlstR-an insect peptide allatostatin (5 ml) produces selective and rapid silencing of targeted neurones. To investigate the role of age-dependent autonomic dysfunction, 7 young (2-3 months) and 8 old (12-16 months) wild type (WT) and triple-synuclein-null (TKO) mice were studied. The animals underwent programmed electrical stimulation of the right ventricle under urethane anaesthesia (1.3g/kg) to obtain ventricular effective refractory period (VERP). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) inducibility by burst pacing was also assessed in the acute rat models. Results: Acute inhibition of the DVMN vagal preganglionic neurones in rats resulted in shortening of the VERP (32.6 + 0.8 vs 41.5 + 0.5 ms; p ¼ 0.002) and lowered VT threshold on burst pacing (21.7 + 4.2 vs 44.4 + 8.9 Hz; p ¼ 0.043). Young TKO mice showed no difference in VERP (37.0 + 5.2 vs 37.0 + 3.1 ms). However, development of autonomic dysfunc-tion in older TKO mice was associated with a reduction in VERP (30.6 + 2.3 vs 43.4 + 2.3 ms; p ¼ 0.003). In old WT animals, systemic administration of methylatropine (2mg/kg) mimicked the pro-arrhythmic phenotype of synuclein deficiency with significant VERP shortening (31.0 + 2.6 vs 43.4 + 2.3 ms; p ¼ 0.004). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that both acute and chronic decrease in activity of a distinct population of vagal preganglionic neurones in the DVMN predisposes the heart to ven-tricular arrhythmia by reduction of the effective refractory period. CNS disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction (mimicked here by synuclein deficiency) and decreased DVMN activity may lead to pro-arrhythmic phenotype.},\n  issue = {suppl 3},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/5DT4676Z/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162213,"version":0},"$loki":581},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1458,"entry":"@article{Aras2018,\n  title = {Critical {{Volume}} of {{Human Myocardium Necessary}} to {{Maintain Ventricular Fibrillation}}},\n  author = {Aras, Kedar K. and Faye, Ndeye Rokhaya and Cathey, Brianna and Efimov, Igor R.},\n  date = {2018},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation.

Consequently, Food and Drug Administration recommends testing all pharmacological agents for QT toxicity as a risk factor for cardiac toxicity. Such tests assess QT/QTc interval, which represents ventricular depolarization and repolarization. However, the current QT toxicity analysis does not account for the well-known anisotropy in cardiac tissue conductivity. Mines demonstrated in 1913 that cardiac wavelength (λ) determines inducibility of reentrant arrhythmia, where both repolarization time or action potential duration and conduction velocity determine λ=action potential duration×conduction velocity. We aimed to determine the role of anisotropic wavelength in inducibility of VF in explanted human left ventricular preparations. We tested the hypothesis that 3-dimensional cardiac wavelength, which takes into account anisotropic cardiac tissue conductivity, can accurately predict VF sustainability. METHODS We conducted panoramic optical mapping of coronary perfused human left ventricular wedge preparations subjected to pharmacologically induced shortening and prolongation of action potential duration, by IK,ATP agonist pinacidil and antagonist glybenclamide, respectively. This measured action potential duration, conduction velocity, and thus determined pacing cycle length-dependent wavelengths in longitudinal (λL), transverse (λTV), and transmural (λTM) directions using S1S1 pacing protocol, from which wavelength volume (Vλ) was determined, as Vλ=λL×λTV×λTM, and compared with tissue volume. We tested a hypothesis that tissue volume/Vλ ratio can predict VF sustainability. RESULTS At baseline, at pacing rate of 240 beats per minute, the wavelengths were λL=9.6±0.6 cm, λTV=4.2±0.3 cm, and λTM=5.8±0.2 cm, respectively (n=7), and thus Vλ=246.4±42.1 cm3. Administration of pinacidil at escalating concentrations progressively decreased Vλ, and VF became sustained, when tissue volume/Vλ was above safety factor κ=4.4±0.6 (n=9) during rapid pacing. Treatment with glybenclamide decreased VT/Vλ below κ at any pacing rate and prevented VF sustainability.

METHODS: The locations and number of major intrinsic cardiac ganglia were determined in six human hearts by means of microdissection following methylene blue staining. Light and electron microscopic analyses were performed on right atrial and cranial medial ventricular ganglia obtained from 12 other human hearts. RESULTS: Gross anatomy: Collections of ganglia associated with nerves, i.e., ganglionated plexuses, were observed consistently in five atrial and five ventricular regions. Occasional ganglia were located in other atrial and ventricular regions. Atrial ganglionated plexuses were identified on 1) the superior surface of the right atrium, 2) the superior surface of the left atrium, 3) the posterior surface of the right atrium, 4) the posterior medial surface of the left atrium (the latter two fuse medially where they extend anteriorly into the interatrial septum), and 5) the inferior and lateral aspect of the posterior left atrium. Ventricular ganglionated plexuses were located in fat 1) surrounding the aortic root, 2) at the origins of the right and left coronary arteries (the latter extending to the origins of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries), 3) at the origin of the posterior descending coronary artery, 4) adjacent to the origin of the right acute marginal coronary artery, and 5) at the origin of the left obtuse marginal coronary artery. Microscopic anatomy: Ganglia ranged in size from those containing a few neurons to large ganglia measuring up to 0.5 x 1 mm. The human heart is estimated to contain more than 14,000 neurons. Neuronal somata varied in size and shape. Many axon terminals in intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained large numbers of small, clear, round vesicles that formed asymmetrical axodendritic synapses, whereas a few axons contained large, dense-cored vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: The human intrinsic cardiac nervous system is distributed more extensively than was considered previously, most of its ganglia being located on the posterior surfaces of the atria and superior aspect of the ventricles. Each ganglion therein contains a variety of neurons that are associated with complex synaptology.},\n  keywords = {atrial neurons,dendrites,intrinsic cardiac ganglia,ventricular neurons}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162244,"version":0},"$loki":585},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1340,"entry":"@article{Barber1983,\n  title = {Transmural Myocardial Infarction in the Dog Produces Sympathectomy in Noninfarcted Myocardium.},\n  author = {Barber, M J and Mueller, T M and Henry, D P and Felten, S Y and Zipes, D P},\n  date = {1983-04},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {67},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {6825234},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {787--96},\n  issn = {0009-7322},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6825234},\n  urldate = {2019-05-28}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162250,"version":0},"$loki":586},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1278,"entry":"@article{Barber1985,\n  title = {Interruption of Sympathetic and Vagal-Mediated Afferent Responses by Transmural Myocardial Infarction.},\n  author = {Barber, M J and Mueller, T M and Davies, B G and Gill, R M and Zipes, D P},\n  date = {1985-09},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {72},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {4017213},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {623--31},\n  issn = {0009-7322},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4017213},\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  abstract = {We have demonstrated previously that sympathetic and vagal afferents travel in an apical-to-basal course in the heart, and can be stimulated selectively with epicardial applications of bradykinin and nicotine, respectively.

This was a secondary analysis of data from a larger study. Participants ages 18 to 50 years without depression, diabetes, or shift work, with sleep duration 6.5 h or more, completed the following evaluations: 7 days of wrist actigraphy, circadian timing assessment (DLMO), and a fasting blood draw to measure glucose and insulin and calculate the Homeostatic Model of Assessment–Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Data were analyzed using correlation and regression analyses controlling for age, sex, DLMO, and sleep duration. Analyses were conducted for the entire sample (n = 54) and stratified by normal weight (n = 36) and overweight/obese groups (n = 18). Mean age was 26.4 years (SD = 7.1 years). Average sleep duration was 436.2 min (SD = 55.1 min), DLMO was 2250h (SD = 01:31), and interval between DLMO and sleep onset was 2 h 18 min (SD = 53 min). Average BMI was 24.3 kg/m2 (SD = 4.5 kg/m2). Circadian timing and interval between DLMO and sleep onset were not associated with glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR in the main analyses. Among overweight/obese participants, a shorter interval between DLMO and sleep onset was associated with higher insulin (B[SE] = −5.12 [2.24], p = 0.04) and HOMA-IR (B[SE] = −1.32 [0.57], p = 0.04). Results of our multivariable model indicated that among overweight/obese participants, insulin was 5.1 pmol/L higher and HOMA was 1.3 µU/mL higher for every hour closer that sleep onset was to DLMO.

Rather, it results primarily from loss of receptors in the subendocardium. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-receptors have been found to be downregulated selectively. These observations suggest that considerable transmural heterogeneity in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes exists in the failing human heart. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites to measure the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in transmural sections of left ventricular myocardium obtained from cardiac transplant patients with ischemic (n = 13) and idiopathic dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy and from 4 subjects with no history of cognitive heart failure. Analysis of radioligand binding isotherms revealed a significant reduction in total beta-adrenergic receptor density in hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (20.3 +/- 1.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively, versus 40.0 +/- 11.4 in control subjects; P {$<$} .01 for both). Loss of the beta 1-subtype accounted for 86\\% of the total reduction in beta-receptor density in failing hearts. Despite the significant decreases in overall tissue receptor content, the densities of total beta-receptors and beta-receptor subtypes in subepicardial myocytes were equivalent in failing and control hearts. However, in contrast to control hearts, in which the transmural distribution of total and beta 1-receptors was uniform (endocardial: epicardial receptor density ratios, 0.97 +/- 0.14 and 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively), hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy had significantly lower total beta-receptor and beta 1-receptor densities in the subendocardium (ratios, 0.66 +/- 0.06 and 0.46 +/- 0.09 for total and beta 1-receptors, respectively, in ischemic cardiomyopathy and 0.60 +/- 0.08 and 0.52 +/- 0.11 in dilated cardiomyopathy; P {$<$} .001 for all values compared with a ratio of 1).

Cardiac-related activity in IC neurons was primarily related to direct cardiac mechano-sensory inputs and indirect autonomic efferent inputs. In response to mediastinal nerve stimulation, most IC neurons became excessively activated; such network behaviour preceded and persisted throughout AF. It was concluded that stochastic interactions occur among IC local circuit neuronal populations in the control of regional cardiac function. Modulation of IC local circuit neuronal recruitment may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cardiac disease, including atrial arrhythmias. © 2013 The Authors.

Intracellular stimulation of relaxed myocytes with regular striation patterns and normal resting potential resulted in action potentials with full plateaus accompanied by contractions. Adenosine in concentrations up to 0.2 mM had no significant effect on any of the action potential parameters or on the basal contractility. In contrast, in the same cells, adenosine effectively antagonized the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol. Isoproterenol (1-10 nM) prolonged the action potentials by 34-41\\%, displaced the plateau to more positive potentials, and caused a 3-fold increase in the extent of myocyte sarcomere shortening. In the presence of adenosine (5-50 μM), isoproterenol increased the action potential duration by only 8-9\\%, the shift of the plateau was nearly abolished, and the increase in the extent of myocyte sarcomere shortening was less than 10\\%. In some of the myocytes, isoproterenol (1-10 nM) induced depolarizing afterpotentials accompanied by aftercontractions. The afterdepolarizations occasionally reached threshold resulting in triggered sustained rhythmic activity. Adenosine (20-50 μM) not only reduced the amplitude of the afterdepolarizations and aftercontractions, but also abolished the sustained rhythmic activity. We conclude, first, that isolated ventricular myocytes respond to isoproterenol and adenosine; second, that adenosine has no direct effect, but effectively antagonizes the stimulatory actions of isoproterenol; third, that findings are consistent with the ones reported for multicellular ventricular preparations; fourth, that adenosine concentrations required to attenuate the actions of isoproterenol are in the range of adenosine concentrations released by cardiac cells when oxygen availability is limited and/or demand is increased; and fifth, that endogenously released adenosine may modulate the electrophysiological and contractile effects of catecholamines.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/IB2U73XY/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162285,"version":0},"$loki":592},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1277,"entry":"@article{Berman2010,\n  title = {Is Stress Cardiomyopathy the Underlying Cause of Ventricular Dysfunction Associated with Brain Death?},\n  author = {Berman, Marius and Ali, Ayyaz and Ashley, Euan and Freed, Darren and Clarke, Kieran and Tsui, Steven and Parameshwar, Jayan and Large, Stephen},\n  date = {2010-09},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation},\n  volume = {29},\n  number = {9},\n  pages = {957--965},\n  issn = {15573117},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.healun.2010.04.008},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053249810002408},\n  urldate = {2019-08-18},\n  abstract = {Most deaths in the first 30 days after cardiac transplantation are due to failure of the donor heart, often with the clinical picture of right ventricular failure.

Microscopy of the myocardium in organ donors shows a picture typical of catecholamine-induced injury and similar to changes found in endomyocardial specimens of stress cardiomyopathy (catecholamineinduced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy).

A total of 147 episodes of sustained AF ({$>$}30 minutes) were recorded and submitted to time-domain and frequency-domain heart rate variability analyses; 6 periods were studied using repeated measures ANOVA: the 24-hour period, the hour preceding PAF, and the 20 minutes before PAF divided into four 5-minute periods. In the time-domain analyses, a linear decrease in mean RR interval from 925+/-16 to 906+/-16 ms (P{$<$}0.0002) was observed before the onset of PAF, together with a significant increase in the standard deviation of NN intervals from 65+/-4 to 70+/-4 ms (P{$<$}0.02).

To date, information on the role of NCX in arrhythmogenesis derived from models with increased NCX expression, hypertrophy, and heart failure. Furthermore, the exact mechanism by which NCX exerts its potentially proarrhythmic effect, ie, by promoting early afterdepolarization (EAD) or delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) or both, is unknown. Methods and Results - We investigated isolated cardiomyocytes from a murine model with heterozygous knockout of NCX (hetKO) using the patch clamp and Ca 2+ imaging techniques. Action potential duration was shorter in hetKO with I Ktot not being increased. The rate of spontaneous Ca 2+ release events and the rate of DADs were unaltered; however, DADs had lower amplitude in hetKO. A DAD triggered a spontaneous action potential significantly less often in hetKO when compared with wild-type. The occurrence of EADs was also drastically reduced in hetKO. I Ca activity was reduced in hetKO, an effect that was abolished in the presence of the Ca 2+ buffer BAPTA. Conclusions - Genetic suppression of NCX reduces both EADs and DADs. The following molecular mechanisms apply: (1) Although the absolute number of DADs is unaffected, an impaired translation of DADs into spontaneous action potentials results from a reduced DAD amplitude. (2) EADs are reduced in absolute number of occurrence, which is presumably a consequence of shortened action potential duration because of reduced NCX activity but also reduced I Ca the latter possibly being caused by a direct modulation of Ca 2+ -dependent I Ca inhibition by reduced NCX activity. This is the first study to demonstrate that genetic inhibition of NCX protects against afterdepolarizations and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.},\n  keywords = {action potentials,arrhythmias,cardiac,heart failure,Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/5JRXD94E/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162318,"version":0},"$loki":598},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":791,"entry":"@article{Bogle2018,\n  title = {Vital Exhaustion and Sudden Cardiac Death in the {{Atherosclerosis Risk}} in {{Communities Study}}.},\n  author = {Bogle, Brittany M and Sotoodehnia, Nona and Kucharska-Newton, Anna M. and Rosamond, Wayne D},\n  date = {2018-03-19},\n  journaltitle = {Heart (British Cardiac Society)},\n  volume = {104},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {28928241},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {423--429},\n  publisher = {{BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Cardiovascular Society}},\n  issn = {1468-201X},\n  doi = {10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311825},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928241},\n  urldate = {2018-03-31},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Vital exhaustion (VE), a construct defined as lack of energy, increased fatigue and irritability, and feelings of demoralisation, has been associated with cardiovascular events.

INTRODUCTION: Although heart rate variability (HRV) has been established as a tool to study cardiac autonomic activity, almost no data are available on the circadian patterns of HRV in healthy subjects aged 20 to 70 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 166 healthy volunteers (81 women and 85 men; age 42 +/- 15 years, range 20-70) without evidence of cardiac disease. Time-domain HRV parameters were determined from 24-hour Holter monitoring and calculated as hourly mean values and mean 24-hour values. All volunteers were fully mobile, awoke around 7 A.M., and had 6 to 8 hours of sleep. Circadian profiles of vagus-associated HRV parameters revealed a marked day-night pattern, with a peak at nighttime and a plateau at daytime. The characteristic nocturnal peak and the day-night amplitude diminished with aging by decade. Estimates of overall HRV (geometric triangular index [TI], SD of NN intervals [SDNN]) and long-term components of HRV (SD of the averages of NN intervals for all 5-min segments [SDANN]) were low at nighttime and increased in the morning hours. There was a significant decline of 24-hour values of all HRV parameters (P {$<$} 0.001) and a strong negative correlation (P {$<$} 0.001) with increasing age. Mean 24-hour RR interval (P {$<$} 0.001), SDNN, mean SD of NN intervals for all 5-minute intervals (SDNNi), and SDANN (all P {$<$} 0.01) were significantly higher in men. Younger men also exhibited significantly higher values for vagus-associated parameters (root mean square successive difference [rMSSD], P {$<$} 0.05; SDNNi, P {$<$} 0.01); however, gender differences diminished with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Normal aging is associated with a constant decline of cardiac vagal modulation due to a significant decrease of nocturnal parasympathetic activity. The significant gender-related difference of HRV decreases with aging. These findings emphasize the need to determine age-, gender-, and nycthemeral-dependent normal ranges for HRV assessment.},\n  isbn = {1045-3873 (Print)},\n  keywords = {Aging,Circadian profile,Gender,Heart rate variability}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162326,"version":0},"$loki":600},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1102,"entry":"@inproceedings{Boudreau2011,\n  title = {Correlation of Heart Rate Variability and Circadian Markers in Humans},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Annual International Conference}} of the {{IEEE Engineering}} in {{Medicine}} and {{Biology Society}}},\n  author = {Boudreau, Philippe and Dumont, Guy and Kin, N.

A circadian variation in the regulation of the cardiovascular system could contribute to this increased cardiovascular risk in the morning. Indeed, circadian rhythms have been shown for a wide array of physiological processes. Using an ultradian sleep-wake cycle (USW) procedure, we sought to determine how heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) correlate with the well-characterized circadian rhythms of cortisol and melatonin secretion. Specific HRV components, namely the low frequency (LF) power, high frequency (HF) power, and the LF:HF ratio can be used as markers of the autonomic modulation of the heart. Cross-correlation between HRV parameters and hormonal rhythms demonstrated that mean RR interval is significantly phase-advanced relative to salivary cortisol and urinary 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (UaMt6s). Parasympathetic modulation of the heart (HF power) was phase-advanced relative to cortisol, but was in-phase with UaMt6s levels. Maximal correlation of the sympathovagal balance (the LF:HF ratio) had no significant lag compared to cortisol secretion and UaMt6s excretion. The protective effect of the parasympathetic nervous system at night, combined with the putative risk associated with the sympathetic nervous system peaking in the morning, could be associated with the increased cardiovascular risk observed in the morning hours.},\n  isbn = {978-1-4577-1589-1},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,circadian,diurnal,Heart rate variability,HRV and blood pressure monitoring},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VAKQ2BKX/Boudreau et al. - 2011 - Correlation of heart rate variability and circadian markers in humans.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162330,"version":0},"$loki":601},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1119,"entry":"@article{Boudreau2013,\n  title = {Circadian {{Variation}} of {{Heart Rate Variability Across Sleep Stages}}},\n  author = {Boudreau, Philippe and Yeh, Wei-Hsien and Dumont, Guy A. and Boivin, Diane B.},\n  date = {2013-12-01},\n  journaltitle = {Sleep},\n  volume = {36},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {24293767},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1919--1928},\n  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},\n  issn = {1550-9109},\n  doi = {10.5665/sleep.3230},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-lookup/doi/10.5665/sleep.3230},\n  urldate = {2018-08-24},\n  abstract = {Study Objectives: Nocturnal cardiovascular events are more frequent at\\$\\textbackslash\\$nthe beginning and end of the night.

Monophasic action potentials were recorded from a left ventricular epicardial site on innervated, isolated rabbit hearts (n = 7). Standard restitution, effective refractory period (ERP) and VF threshold (VFT) were measured at baseline and during VNS in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 200 microm) and during reversing NO blockade with L-arginine (L-Arg, 1 mm). Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M. The restitution curve was shifted upwards and became less steep with VNS when compared to baseline. L-NA blocked the effect of VNS whereas L-Arg restored the effect of VNS. The maximum slope of restitution was reduced from 1.17 +/- 0.14 to 0.60 +/- 0.09 (50 +/- 5\\%, P {$<$} 0.0001) during control, from 0.98 +/- 0.14 to 0.93 +/- 0.12 (2 +/- 10\\%, P = NS) in the presence of L-NA and from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 0.50 +/- 0.10 (41 +/- 9\\%, P = 0.003) with L-Arg plus L-NA.

Direct VNS increased VFT and flattened the slope of APD restitution curve in this isolated rabbit heart preparation with intact autonomic nerves. These effects were blocked using L-NA and reversed by replenishing the substrate for NO production with L-Arg. This is the first study to demonstrate that NO plays an important role in the anti-fibrillatory effect of VNS on the rabbit ventricle, possibly via effects on APD restitution.},\n  isbn = {0022-3751 (Print)\\textbackslash r0022-3751 (Linking)},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/K8793GPA/2007 - Brack et al. - Nitric oxide mediates the vagal protective effect on ventricular fibrillation via effects on action potential dura.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162340,"version":0},"$loki":603},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1576,"entry":"@article{Butler2020,\n  title = {Effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Endogenous Circadian Rhythms Assessed during Relaxed Wakefulness; an Exploratory Analysis},\n  author = {Butler, Matthew P. and Thosar, Saurabh S. and Smales, Carolina and DeYoung, Pamela N. and Wu, Huijuan and Hussain, Mohammad V. and Morimoto, Miki and Hu, Kun and Scheer, Frank A.J.L. and Shea, Steven A.},\n  date = {2020},\n  journaltitle = {Chronobiology International},\n  volume = {00},\n  number = {00},\n  pages = {1--11},\n  publisher = {{Taylor \\& Francis}},\n  issn = {15256073},\n  doi = {10.1080/07420528.2020.1740723},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1740723},\n  abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and a change in the 24~h pattern of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. Adverse cardiovascular events occur more frequently in the middle of the night in people with OSA, earlier than the morning prevalence of these events in the general population. It is unknown if these changes are associated with a change in the underlying circadian rhythms, independent of behaviors such as sleep, physical activity, and meal intake. In this exploratory analysis, we studied the endogenous circadian rhythms of blood pressure, heart rate, melatonin and cortisol in 11 participants (48~±~4~years; seven with OSA) throughout a 5 day study that was originally designed to examine circadian characteristics of obstructive apnea events. After a baseline night, participants completed 10 recurring 5~h 20~min behavioral cycles divided evenly into standardized sleep and wake periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in a relaxed semirecumbent posture 15~minutes after each scheduled wake time. Salivary melatonin and cortisol concentrations were measured at 1–1.5~h intervals during wakefulness. Mixed-model cosinor analyses were performed to determine the rhythmicity of all variables with respect to external time and separately to circadian phases (aligned to the dim light melatonin onset, DLMO). The circadian rhythm of blood pressure peaked much later in OSA compared to control participants (group × circadian phase, p {$<~$}.05); there was also a trend toward a slightly delayed cortisol rhythm in the OSA group. Rhythms of heart rate and melatonin did not differ between the groups. In this exploratory analysis, OSA appears to be associated with a phase change (relative to DLMO) in the endogenous circadian rhythm of blood pressure during relaxed wakefulness, independent of common daily behaviors.},\n  keywords = {adverse cardiovascular events,blood pressure,circadian clock,circadian rhythms,non-dipping blood pressure,Sleep disordered breathing},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/PJ9TU2WM/2020_Butler et al._Effects of obstructive sleep apnea on endogenous circadian rhythms assessed during relaxed wakefulness an exploratory.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162346,"version":0},"$loki":604},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1420,"entry":"@article{Cannon1931,\n  title = {{{THE EFFECTS OF PROGRESSIVE SYMPATHECTOMY ON BLOOD PRESSURE}}},\n  author = {Cannon, Bradford},\n  date = {1931-07-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Physiology-Legacy Content},\n  volume = {97},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {592--596},\n  issn = {0002-9513},\n  doi = {10.1152/ajplegacy.1931.97.4.592},\n  url = {https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajplegacy.1931.97.4.592},\n  urldate = {2020-03-14},\n  abstract = {The close dependence of vascular tone on sympathetic impulses as shown by more or less persistent vasodilatation when the sympathetic nerves to arterioles are cut, the importance of vascular tone for the proper distribution of blood in the body, and the recent increase in the application of surgery to the sympathetic system render important an enquiry into the effect of sympathectomy on blood pressure. The work of W. B. Cannon, Lewis and Britton (1927) proved that animals can survive total abolition of sympathetic activity in the body. It was clear, therefore, that a study could be made of the effects on blood pressure of extirpating not only parts of the sympathetic system but the whole system as a distributor of tonic impulses to blood vessels. METHOD. For the present study dogs between 11 kgm. and 13 kgm. in weight were used. They were found large enough to allow accurate readings of the blood pressure and small enough to make operating possible. They were trained to lie quietly on a table during the blood-pressure de-terminations. A typical rubber cuff, reduced in width to about 8 cm., was used, and the pressure was measured by means of a mercury manometer. The cuff was applied to the leg below the knee; a small diaphragm stethoscope , or palpation, or both, were used to determine the disappearance and reappearance of the pulse. The artery (dorsalis pedis) on the anterior surface of the foot served for the observations. By this method it was possible to get reasonably consistent results in repeated observations within a brief period under similar conditions. Care was taken to place the cuff as nearly as possible in the same position in successive readings. The heart rate was recorded with the blood pressure. With one exception the parts of the sympathetic system were removed in the same order. The first step was the removal of both abdominal chains from the diaphragm to the sacrum and the severance of the right splanch-nits at the diaphragm. The second was the removal of the right thoracic chain from the stellate ganglion to the diaphragm through which were pulled the remnants of the splanchnics.

This is regulated by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus.

Conventional immediate-release hydrocortisone, either at twice- or thrice-daily doses, is not capable of replicating physiological cortisol circadian rhythm and patients with adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia still suffer from a poor quality of life and increased mortality. Novel treatments for replacement therapy are therefore essential. Proof-of-concept studies using hydrocortisone infusions suggest that the circadian delivery of hydrocortisone may improve biochemical control and life quality in patients lacking cortisol with an impaired cortisol rhythm. Recently oral formulations of modified-release hydrocortisone are being developed and it has been shown that it is possible to replicate cortisol circadian rhythm and also achieve better control of morning androgen levels.

The Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect describe exquisite intrinsic mechanisms the heart has for autoregulating the force of contraction to maintain cardiac output under changes of preload and afterload. Although these mechanisms have been known for more than a century, their cellular and molecular underpinnings are still debated. How does the cardiac myocyte sense changes in preload or afterload? How does the myocyte adjust its response to compensate for such changes? In cardiac myocytes Ca 2+ is a crucial regulator of contractile force and in this review we compare and contrast recent studies from different labs that address these two important questions. The 'dimensionality' of the mechanical milieu under which experiments are carried out provide important clues to the location of the mechanosensors and the kinds of mechanical forces they can sense and respond to. As a first approximation, sensors inside the myocyte appear to modulate reactive oxygen species while sensors on the cell surface appear to also modulate nitric oxide signalling; both signalling pathways affect Ca 2+ handling. Undoubtedly, further studies will add layers to this simplified picture. Clarifying the intimate links from cellular mechanics to reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling and to Ca 2+ handling will deepen our understanding of the Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect, and also provide a unified view on how arrhythmias may arise in seemingly disparate diseases that have in common altered myocyte mechanics. Ye Chen-Izu and Leighton T. Izu collaborate in an interdisciplinary team to combine experiments with mathematical modeling for in-depth analyses of the interaction of three dynamics systems – electrical, Ca 2+ signaling, and mechanical systems – that govern cardiac function and heart diseases. Abstract figure legend Surface and internal mechanosensors link to NO and ROS signalling and to Ca 2+ handling. Surface (blue) and internal (red and green) mechanosensors are depicted as springs. In experimental systems where the myocyte is in bathing solution that offers little mechanical resistance, the surface mechanosensors experience little or no strain (change in length divided by original length) as shown in the left panel. The internal mechanosensors experience strain and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect Ca 2+ handling. In other experimental systems the myocyte is adherent to a stretchable membrane or encased in a viscoelastic gel that provides mechanical resistance as the cell contracts or stretches; this mechanical loading causes surface mechanosensor strain as shown in the right panel. In these systems both internal and surface mechanosensors are activated.

It is known that sympathetic stimulation is important in the generation of sudden cardiac death. For example, there is a diurnal variation of sudden death rate in patients with myocardial infarction. Beta blockers, or drugs with beta blocking effects, are known to prevent sudden cardiac death. It was unclear if the cardiac nerves in the heart play only a passive role in the mechanisms of sudden death. To determine if nerve sprouting and neural remodeling occur after myocardial infarction, we performed immunocytochemical studies of cardiac nerves in explanted native hearts of transplant recipients. We found that there was a positive correlation between nerve density and a clinical history of ventricular arrhythmia. Encouraged by these results, we performed a study in dogs to determine whether or not nerve growth factor (NGF) infusion to the left stellate ganglion can facilitate the development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The results showed that augmented myocardial sympathetic nerve sprouting through NGF infusion plus atrioventricular (AV) block and MI result in a 44\\% incidence (four of nine dogs) of SCD and a high incidence of VT in the chronic phase of MI. In contrast, none of the six dogs (with AV block and MI) without NGF infusion died suddenly or had frequent VT episodes. Based on these findings, we propose the nerve sprouting hypothesis of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD. The hypothesis states that MI results in nerve injury, followed by sympathetic nerve sprouting and regional (heterogeneous) myocardial hyperinnervation. The coupling between augmented sympathetic nerve sprouting with electrically remodeled myocardium results in VT, VF and SCD. Modification of nerve sprouting after MI may provide a novel opportunity for arrhythmia control. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,Infarction,Ion channels,Remodeling,Sudden death,Ventricular arrhythmias}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162381,"version":0},"$loki":610},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1221,"entry":"@article{Coote2013,\n  title = {Myths and Realities of the Cardiac Vagus},\n  author = {Coote, J H},\n  date = {2013},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Physiology},\n  volume = {591},\n  number = {17},\n  eprint = {23878363},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {4073--4085},\n  issn = {00223751},\n  doi = {10.1113/jphysiol.2013.257758},\n  abstract = {There is continuing belief that cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres are sparse or absent from the ventricles. This review of the literature shows that the supposition is a myth. Early studies considered that fine silver-stained fibres coursing amongst ventricle myocardial cells were most likely cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres. The conclusions were later supported by acetyl cholinesterase staining using a method that appeared not to be associated with noradrenaline nerve fibres. The conclusion is critically examined in the light of several recent histological studies using the acetyl cholinesterase method and also a more definitive technique (CHAT), that suggest a widespread location of parasympathetic ganglia and a relatively dense parasympathetic innervation of ventricular muscle in a range of mammals including man. The many studies demonstrating acetylcholine release in the ventricle on vagal nerve stimulation and a high density of acetylcholine M2 receptors is in accord with this as are tests of ventricular performance from many physiological studies. Selective control of cardiac functions by anatomically segregated parasympathetic ganglia is discussed. It is argued that the influence of vagal stimulation on ventricular myocardial action potential refractory period, duration, force and rhythm is evidence that vagal fibres have close apposition to myocardial fibres. This is supported by clear evidence of accentuated antagonism between sympathetic activity and vagal activity in the ventricle and also by direct effects of vagal activity independent of sympathetic activity. The idea of differential control of atrial and ventricular physiology by vagal C and vagal B preganglionic fibres is examined as well as differences in chemical phenotypes and their function. The latter is reflected in medullary and supramedullary control.

Sympathetic activity is known to be upregulated during these conditions and hence the sympathetic nerves present a target for treatment. However, a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac sympathetic nerves is required for the progression of clinical interventions. This review explores the organization of the cardiac sympathetic nerves, from the preganglionic origin to the postganglionic innervations, and provides an overview of literature surrounding anti-arrhythmic therapies including thoracic sympathectomy and dorsal spinal cord stimulation. Several features of the innervation are clear. The cardiac nerves differentially supply the nodal and myocardial tissue of the heart and are dependent on activity generated in spinal neurones in the upper thoracic cord which project to synapse with ganglion cells in the stellate complex on each side. Networks of spinal interneurones determine the pattern of activity. Groups of spinal neurones selectively target specific regions of the heart but whether they exhibit a functional selectivity has still to be elucidated. Electrical or ischemic signals can lead to remodeling of nerves in the heart or ganglia. Surgical and electrical methods are proving to be clinically beneficial in reducing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and severe cardiac pain. This is a rapidly developing area and we need more basic understanding of how these methods work to ensure safety and reduction of side effects.},\n  keywords = {Cardiac arrhythmias,Cardiac nerves,Cardiac sympathectomy,Dorsal spinal cord stimulation,Spinal interneurones,Sympathetic preganglionic neurones},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/2FZ3SPEZ/2016 - Coote, Chauhan - The sympathetic innervation of the heart Important new insights.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162390,"version":0},"$loki":612},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1443,"entry":"@article{Cornelissen2014,\n  title = {Cosinor-Based Rhythmometry},\n  author = {Cornelissen, Germaine},\n  date = {2014-04-11},\n  journaltitle = {Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling},\n  volume = {11},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {24725531},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {16},\n  publisher = {{BioMed Central}},\n  issn = {17424682},\n  doi = {10.1186/1742-4682-11-16},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725531},\n  urldate = {2019-10-13},\n  abstract = {A brief overview is provided of cosinor-based techniques for the analysis of time series in chronobiology.

Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics, especially in the conduction system. Our objective was to assess the relative distribution of autonomic nerves in the pig heart, focusing initially on the conduction system but addressing also the myocardium, endocardium and epicardium (see Crick et al. 1999). Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were adopted. All regions of the conduction system possessed a significantly higher relative density of the total neural population immunoreactive for the general neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) than did the adjacent myocardium. A similar density of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was observed between the sinus node, the transitional region of the atrioventricular node, and the penetrating atrioventricular bundle. A differential pattern of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was present within the atrioventricular node and between the components of the ventricular conduction tissues, the latter being formed by an intricate network of Purkinje fibres. Numerous ganglion cell bodies were present in the peripheral regions of the sinus node, in the tissues of the atrioventricular groove, and even in the interstices of the compact atrioventricular node. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing nerves were the dominant subpopulation observed, representing 60-70\\% of the total pattern of innervation in the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most abundant neural subpopulation, representing 37\\% of the total pattern of innervation in the compact atrioventricular node compared with 25\\% in the transitional nodal region. A minor population of ganglion cell bodies within the atrioventricular nodal region displayed TH immunoreactivity. The dominant peptidergic nerve supply possessed immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y (NPY), which displayed a similar pattern of distribution to that of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibres. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves represented 8-9\\% of the total innervation of the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle, increasing to 14-19\\% in the bundle branches. Somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were relatively sparse (4-13\\% of total innervation) and were most abundant in the nodes, especially the compact atrioventricular node. The total pattern of innervation of the porcine conduction system was relatively homogeneous. A substantial proportion of nerve fibres innervating the nodal tissues could be traced to intracardiac ganglia indicative of an extensive intrinsic supply. The innervation of the atrioventricular node and ventricular conduction tissues was similar to that observed in the bovine heart, but markedly different to that of the human heart. It is important that we are aware of these findings in view of the future use of transgenic pig hearts in human xenotransplantation.},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,Cardiac conduction system,Xenotransplantation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/SIT8UNGZ/m-api-7b4d2428-ada9-14ed-7932-71bd0380cdd1.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162401,"version":0},"$loki":614},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1344,"entry":"@article{CRICK1999a,\n  title = {Localisation and Quantitation of Autonomic Innervation in the Porcine Heart {{II}}: Endocardium, Myocardium and Epicardium.},\n  author = {Crick, S J and Anderson, R H and Ho, S Y and Sheppard, M N},\n  date = {1999-10},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of anatomy},\n  volume = {195 ( Pt 3},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {10580851},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {359--73},\n  issn = {0021-8782},\n  doi = {10.1046/j.1469-7580.1999.19530359.x},\n  abstract = {The immunological problems of pig hearts supporting life in human recipients have potentially been solved by transgenic technology. Nevertheless, other problems still remain. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics and there is evidence suggesting that some neurons remain intact after transplantation. Previous studies in the human heart have established regional differences in both general autonomic innervation and in its component neural subpopulations. Such studies are lacking in the pig heart. Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the pattern of innervation in pig hearts (Sus scrofa). Gradients of immunoreactivity for the general neural marker protein gene product 9.5 were observed both within and between the endocardial, myocardial and epicardial plexuses throughout the 4 cardiac chambers. An extensive ganglionated plexus was observed in the epicardial tissues and, to a lesser extent, in the myocardial tissues. The predominant neural subpopulation displayed acetylcholinesterase activity, throughout the endocardium, myocardium and epicardium. These nerves showed a right to left gradient in density in the endocardial plexus, which was not observed in either the myocardial or epicardial plexuses. A large proportion of nerves in the ganglionated plexus of the atrial epicardial tissues displayed AChE activity, together with their cell bodies. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most prominent subpopulation throughout the heart. TH-immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the atrial ganglionated plexuses. Endocardial TH- and NPY-immunoreactive nerves also displayed a right to left gradient in density, whereas in the epicardial tissues they showed a ventricular to atrial gradient. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves were the most abundant peptide-containing subpopulation after those possessing NPY immunoreactivity. They were most abundant in the epicardial tissues of the ventricles. Several important differences were observed between the innervation of the pig heart compared with the human heart.

Bainbridge demonstrated in 1915 that an infusion of saline or blood into the jugular vein of the anesthetized dog produced tachycardia. His findings after transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of the cholinergic blocking drug atropine demonstrated that the tachycardia was reflex in origin, with the vagus nerves constituting the afferent limb and a withdrawal of vagal tone the primary efferent limb. Subsequent investigators demonstrated that the increase in venous return was detected by stretch receptors in the right and left atria. In the 1980s, it was shown convincingly that the Bainbridge reflex was present in primates, including humans, but that the reflex was much less prominent than in the dog. This difference may be due to a more dominant arterial baroreceptor reflex in humans. A \"reverse\" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in heart rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage. The Bainbridge reflex is invoked throughout the anesthesia literature to describe the effect of changes in venous return on heart rate in patients in the surgical and critical care settings, but a critical analysis of the experimental and clinical evidence is lacking. Our main objectives in this review are to summarize the history of the Bainbridge reflex, to describe its anatomy and physiology, and to discuss the evidence for and against it having an influence on heart rate changes observed clinically.

The resultant effects on the cardiovascular system vary with the level and the extent of sympathetic blockade. Involvement of the lower thoracic region (T6 to L1) by thoracic epidural anesthesia is associated with increased venous capacitance and redistribution of blood to the dilated splanchnic veins. This results in decreased venous return to the heart and a reduction of cardiac preload. 3 Arterial vasodilation in blocked segments is counteracted by compensatory vasoconstriction in unblocked segments, and the effect on cardiac afterload depends on the balance between blocked and unblocked segments. 4 Direct effects of cardiac sympatholysis have not been the subject of detailed investigation. Many studies quantified the cardiac effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia using load-dependent indices of contractile performance, which does not allow differentiation between direct and indirect effects. Regardless, the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia have generally been considered beneficial to the cardiovascular system and protective against surgical stress. 5 Interestingly, recent systematic reviews have not been able to confirm improved cardiac outcome in surgical patients treated with thoracic epidural anesthesia. 6 In contrast, some evidence was found for increased cardiovascular problems in high-risk patients receiving neuraxial block. 7,8 In light of these concerns, a reappraisal of the cardiovascular effects associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia seems appropriate. Since the last published review on this subject, 9 new data have emerged from experimental and clinical studies addressing previously unexplored domains such as the effects of cardiac sympathectomy on right ven-tricular function, an important determinant of outcome in surgery. 10-12 We conducted the present review to update the knowledge in this field, with focus on the effects associated with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympa-thectomy in the normal and diseased cardiovascular system. Materials and Methods The databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched by the author and by an independent expert librarian to identify studies in which the cardiac sympathetic nerves (T1 to T5) are involved in neural blockade by thoracic epidural anesthesia. An extensive list of used ABStRAct Cardiac sympathetic blockade with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia is considered beneficial in patients undergoing major surgery because it offers protection in ischemic heart disease. Major outcome studies have failed to confirm such a benefit, however. In fact, there is growing concern about potential harm associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia in high-risk patients, although underlying mechanisms have not been identified. Since the latest review on this subject, a number of clinical and experimental studies have provided new information on the complex interaction between thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis and cardiovascular control mechanisms. Perhaps these new insights may help identify conditions in which benefits of thoracic epidural anesthesia may not outweigh potential risks. For example, cardiac sympathectomy with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia decreases right ventricular function and attenuates its capacity to cope with increased right ventricular afterload. Although the clinical significance of this pathophysiologic interaction is unknown at present, it identifies a subgroup of patients with established or pending pulmonary hypertension for whom outcome studies are needed. Other new areas of interest include the impact of thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis on cardiovascular control in conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, surgical stress, and hemodynamic disruption. It was considered appropriate to collect and analyze all recent scientific information on this subject to provide a comprehensive update on the cardiovascular effects of high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympathectomy in healthy and diseased patients.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/YMDVJJVC/2019 - Wink et al. - Effects of Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia on Neuronal Cardiac Regulation and Cardiac Function.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162413,"version":0},"$loki":617},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":859,"entry":"@article{Davis1993,\n  title = {Brain-Heart Interactions. {{The}} Neurocardiology of Arrhythmia and Sudden Cardiac Death.},\n  author = {Davis, A M and Natelson, B H},\n  date = {1993},\n  journaltitle = {Texas Heart Institute journal},\n  volume = {20},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {8219819},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {158--69},\n  issn = {0730-2347},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8219819},\n  urldate = {2018-10-25},\n  abstract = {Neuroanatomic connections between the brain and the heart provide links that allow cardiac arrhythmias to occur in response to brain activation.

The pathophysiology has mainly been investigated in experimental animal models and human medicine, with limited studies in horses. Atrial fibrillation results from the interplay between electrical triggers and a susceptible substrate. Triggers consist of atrial premature depolarizations due to altered automaticity or triggered activity, or local (micro)reentry. The arrhythmia is promoted by atrial myocardial ion channel alterations, Ca2+ handling alterations, structural abnormalities, and autonomic nervous system imbalance. Predisposing factors include structural heart disease such as valvular regurgitation resulting in chronic atrial stretch, although many horses show so-called ‘lone AF’ or idiopathic AF in which no underlying cardiac abnormalities can be detected using routine diagnostic techniques. These horses may have underlying ion channel dysfunction or undiagnosed myocardial (micro)structural alterations. Atrial fibrillation itself results in electrical, contractile and structural remodelling, fostering AF maintenance. Electrical remodelling leads to shortening of the atrial effective refractory period, promoting reentry. Contractile remodelling consists of decreased myocardial contractility, while structural remodelling includes the development of interstitial fibrosis and atrial enlargement. Reverse remodelling occurs after cardioversion to sinus rhythm, but full recovery may take weeks to months depending on duration of AF. The clinical signs of AF depend on the aerobic demands during exercise, ventricular rhythm response and presence of underlying cardiac disease. In horses with so-called ‘lone AF’, clinical signs are usually absent at rest but during exercise poor performance, exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory distress, weakness or rarely collapse may develop.},\n  keywords = {Arrhythmia,Atrial remodelling,Cardiology,Electrocardiography,Equine},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/JMT5CV53/2020_Decloedt et al._Atrial fibrillation in horses part 1 Pathophysiology.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162421,"version":0},"$loki":619},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1975,"entry":"@article{DeFerrari1995,\n  title = {Distinct Patterns of Calcium Transients during Early and Delayed Afterdepolarizations Induced by Isoproterenol in Ventricular Myocytes},\n  author = {De Ferrari, Gaetano M. and Viola, Maria Cristina and D'Amato, Elvira and Antolini, Renzo and Forti, Stefano},\n  date = {1995-05-15},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {91},\n  number = {10},\n  eprint = {7743611},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {2510--2515},\n  publisher = {{Lippincott Williams \\& Wilkins}},\n  issn = {00097322},\n  doi = {10.1161/01.CIR.91.10.2510},\n  url = {https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.CIR.91.10.2510},\n  urldate = {2022-07-13},\n  abstract = {Background: The relation between early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) is still unclear. In the present study, we compared spatiotemporal changes in [Ca2+](i) related to EADs and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) induced by isoproterenol. Methods and Results: Isolated patch-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes, loaded with fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3 AM), were paced at 0.1 to 2 Hz. Isoproterenol (100 nmol/L) caused alterations in both phase 2 and phase 4 of the action potential (AP), consistent with EADs and DADs, respectively. During EADs (n=16), similar to driven APs, increases in [Ca2+](i), occurred simultaneously throughout the cell, whereas during DADs (n=25), they originated in discrete cell sites and propagated as a wave. This difference was confirmed by analysis of eight EADs and DADs coupled to the same beat. Ca2+ transients linked to EADs reached a peak relative fluorescence level (expressed as percentage of the maximal level reached during the last stimulated beat) that was always higher than that reached during the DADs (77±3\\% versus 64±2\\%, P{$<$}.001). Spatial heterogeneity of Ca2+ transients was assessed by the maximal time interval between peaks monitored in different cell regions; this time lag was always greater during DADs than during EADs (290 versus 40 milliseconds, P=.006). Conclusions: The present study had two main findings. First, even very modest notches occurring during the plateau of the AP may be accompanied by a marked secondary increase in [Ca2+](i). Second, these Ca2+ transients occurring during EADs are synchronous throughout the cell and differ significantly from those observed under identical conditions during DADs.},\n  keywords = {afterdepolarizations,calcium,isoproterenol,myocytes}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162437,"version":0},"$loki":620},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1465,"entry":"@article{Deo2018,\n  title = {Differences in {{Risk}} of {{Sudden Cardiac Death Between Blacks}} and {{Whites}}},\n  author = {Deo, Rajat and Safford, Monika M. and Khodneva, Yulia A. and Jannat-Khah, Deanna P. and Brown, Todd M. and Judd, Suzanne E. and McClellan, William M. and Rhodes, J.

Methods: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study is a prospective, population-based cohort of adults from across the United States. Associations between race and SCD defined per National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were assessed. Results: Among 22,507 participants (9,416 blacks and 13,091 whites) without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease, there were 174 SCD events (67 whites and 107 blacks) over a median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range: 4.6 to 7.3 years).

To conduct his experimental work, MacWilliam devised methods that laid the foundations for modern cardiac research and that provided the first comprehensive approach to successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He recognized the role of the autonomic nervous system in modulating both the mechanical and the electrical properties of the heart, and was the first to suggest that this effect had a role in the genesis of sudden death. On the centennial of his theory of sudden death, MacWilliam's concepts are reviewed in the context of the effect of Darwinian influence on British physiology. It is suggested that his theorem was based on both sound experimental data and comparative physiology, drawing on the new evolutionary principle of similar structure and function in the hearts of various species.

This study determined whether cardiopulmonary reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was abnormal in a canine model of low-output heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS We stimulated mechanoreceptors throughout the cardiopulmonary region by volume expansion and left atrial mechanoreceptors selectively by inflating small balloons at the junctions of the pulmonary veins and left atrium. Responses of renal sympathetic nerve activity and left atrial and systemic arterial pressures were recorded. In the control group, 15\\% volume expansion raised left atrial pressure 3.5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg and resulted in a 70 +/- 8\\% reduction in renal nerve activity. In the heart failure group, 15\\% volume expansion resulted in a 6.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg rise in left atrial pressure with only a 16 +/- 20\\% reduction in renal nerve activity (p {$<$} 0.01). When volume expansion was performed after pretreatment with hemorrhage to lower left atrial pressure to the normal range in the heart failure group, the markedly attenuated response in the heart failure group persisted. After vagotomy, volume expansion elicited no change in renal nerve activity. Inflation of the atrial balloons caused a 28 +/- 9\\% reduction in renal sympathetic nerve activity and a 13 +/- 4 mm Hg decrease in arterial pressure in the control group. Renal nerve activity (-5 +/- 3\\%) and mean arterial pressure (-1 +/- 1 mm Hg) did not change with balloon inflation in the heart failure group. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that dogs with low-output heart failure exhibit marked attenuation of cardiopulmonary mechanoreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity. This attenuated response is mediated via cardiac vagal afferent fibers and is due to either abnormalities in cardiopulmonary baroreceptors or abnormalities in the central nervous system.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162450,"version":0},"$loki":623},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1234,"entry":"@article{DiCarli2002,\n  title = {Effects of {{Cardiac Sympathetic Innervation}} on {{Coronary Blood Flow}}},\n  author = {Di Carli, Marcelo F. and Tobes, Michael C. and Mangner, Thomas and Levine, Arlene Barry and Muzik, Otto and Chakroborty, Pulak and Levine, T.

We sought to determine the degree to which cardiac efferent sympathetic signals modulate coronary blood flow. The heterogeneous sympathetic reinnervation in transplanted hearts provides a model for studying the vasomotor responses to adrenergic stimulation in reinnervated and denervated coronary territories of the same heart. Methods: We studied 14 cardiac-transplant recipients who had normal coronary arteries and no evidence of rejection and 8 normal subjects. We used positron-emission tomography with [11C]hydroxyephedrine, an analogue of norepinephrine, to delineate sympathetic innervation. Using [13N]ammonia, we measured myocardial blood flow at rest, during adenosine-induced hyperemia, and in response to sympathetic stimulation induced by cold pressor testing. Results: In the transplant recipients, the uptake of [11C]hydroxyephedrine was greater in the territory served by the left anterior descending artery (mean±SE, 0.15±0.01) than in those served by the right coronary artery (0.07±0.01, P{$<$}0.001) or the circumflex artery (0.09±0.01, P{$<$}0.001). The basal flow was similar in all three regions, as was the percent increase in flow during hyperemia. However, the increase in flow in response to cold pressor testing was higher in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (46±10 percent) than in those of the right coronary artery (16±6 percent, P=0.01) or the circumflex artery (23±6 percent, P=0.06), although the changes in hemodynamics and levels of circulating catecholamines were similar. No such regional differences were observed in the normal subjects. Conclusions: Increases in coronary blood flow in response to sympathetic stimulation correlated with the regional norepinephrine content in the cardiac sympathetic-nerve terminals. These findings suggest that cardiac adrenergic signals play an important part in regulating myocardial blood flow.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162451,"version":0},"$loki":624},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1203,"entry":"@article{Dickerson1998,\n  title = {Parasympathetic Neurons in the Cranial Medial Ventricular Fat Pad on the Dog Heart Selectively Decrease Ventricular Contractility},\n  author = {Dickerson, Linda W and Rodak, David J and Fleming, Terence J and Gatti, Philip J and Massari, V John and McKenzie, James C. and Gillis, Richard A},\n  date = {1998},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the Autonomic Nervous System},\n  volume = {70},\n  number = {1-2},\n  pages = {129--141},\n  issn = {01651838},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0165-1838(98)00048-4},\n  abstract = {We hypothesized that selective control of ventricular contractility might be mediated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the cranial medial ventricular (CMV) ganglion plexus located in a fat pad at the base of the aorta.

Seven of these dogs were tested under beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.8 mg kg -1 i.v.).

Five dogs were re-tested 3 h after trimethaphan fat pad injection, at which time blockade of vagally-induced negative inotropy was partially reversed, as vagal stimulation decreased LV dP/dt by 19\\%. The same dose of trimethaphan given either locally into other fat pads (PVFP or IVC-ILA) or systemically (i.v.) had no effect on vagally-induced negative inotropy. Thus, parasympathetic ganglia located in the CMV fat pad mediated a decrease in ventricular contractility during vagal stimulation.

Epidemiological studies have shown that SCD and ventricular arrhythmias are more likely to occur in the morning than in the evening, and laboratory studies indicate that these daily rhythms in adverse cardiovascular events are at least partially under the control of the endogenous circadian timekeeping system. However, the biophysical mechanisms linking molecular circadian clocks to cardiac arrhythmogenesis are not fully understood. Recent experiments have shown that L-type calcium channels exhibit circadian rhythms in both expression and function in guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes. We developed an electrophysiological model of these cells to simulate the effect of circadian variation in L-type calcium conductance. In our simulations, we found that there is a circadian pattern in the occurrence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are abnormal depolarizations during the repolarization phase of a cardiac action potential that can trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Specifically, the model produces EADs in the morning, but not at other times of day. We show that the model exhibits a codimension-2 Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation that serves as an organizing center for different types of EAD dynamics. We also simulated a two-dimensional spatial version of this model across a circadian cycle. We found that there is a circadian pattern in the breakup of spiral waves, which represents ventricular fibrillation in cardiac tissue. Specifically, the model produces spiral wave breakup in the morning, but not in the evening. Our computational study is the first, to our knowledge, to propose a link between circadian rhythms and EAD formation and suggests that the efficacy of drugs targeting EAD-mediated arrhythmias may depend on the time of day that they are administered.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/HNRME283/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162457,"version":0},"$loki":626},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1098,"entry":"@article{Dominguez-Rodriguez2010,\n  title = {Melatonin and Circadian Biology in Human Cardiovascular Disease},\n  author = {Dominguez-Rodriguez, Alberto and Abreu-Gonzalez, Pedro and Sanchez-Sanchez, Juan J. and Kaski, Juan C. and Reiter, Russel J.},\n  date = {2010-05-01},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Pineal Research},\n  volume = {49},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {20536686},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {14--22},\n  publisher = {{Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)}},\n  issn = {1600079X},\n  doi = {10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00773.x},\n  url = {http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00773.x},\n  urldate = {2018-12-10},\n  abstract = {Diurnal rhythms influence cardiovascular physiology, i.e. heart rate and blood pressure, and they appear to also modulate the incidence of serious adverse cardiac events. Diurnal variations occur also at the molecular level including changes in gene expression in the heart and blood vessels. Moreover, the risk/benefit ratio of some therapeutic strategies and the concentration of circulating cardiovascular system biomarkers may also vary across the 24-hr light/dark cycle. Synchrony between external and internal diurnal rhythms and harmony among molecular rhythms within the cell are essential for normal organ biology. Diurnal variations in the responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to environmental stimuli are mediated by a complex interplay between extracellular (i.e. neurohumoral factors) and intracellular (i.e. specific genes that are differentially light/dark regulated) mechanisms. Neurohormones, which are particularly relevant to the cardiovascular system, such as melatonin, exhibit a diurnal variation and may play a role in the synchronization of molecular circadian clocks in the peripheral tissue and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Moreover, mounting evidence reveals that the blood melatonin rhythm has a crucial role in several cardiovascular functions, including daily variations in blood pressure. Melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chronobiotic and, possibly, epigenetic regulatory functions.

The method, originally described for analysis of longitudinal time series, is here extended to allow analysis of hybrid data (time series sampled from a group of subjects, each represented by an individual series). Given k individual series, we can fit the same linear model with m different frequencies (harmonics or not from one fundamental period) to each series. This fit will provide estimations for 2m + 1 parameters, namely, the amplitude and acrophase of each component, as well as the rhythm-adjusted mean. Assuming that the set of parameters obtained for each individual is a random sample from a multivariate normal population, the corresponding population parameter estimates can be based on the means of estimates obtained from individuals in the sample. Their confidence intervals depend on the variability among individual parameter estimates. The variance- covariance matrix can then be estimated on the basis of the sample covariances. Confidence intervals for the rhythm-adjusted mean, as well as for the amplitude-acrophase pair, of each component can then be computed using the estimated covariance matrix. The p-values for testing the zero- amplitude assumption for each component, as well as for the global model, can finally be derived using those confidence intervals and the t and F distributions.

With a small number of parameters, it is possible to model and to predict the periodic behavior of a population. In this article, we propose two methods to compare among populations rhythmometric parameters obtained by multiple component analysis. The first is a parametric method based in the usual statistical techniques for comparison of mean vectors in multivariate normal populations. The method, through MANOVA analysis, allows comparison of the MESOR and amplitude-acrophase pair of each component among two or more populations. The second is a nonparametric method, based in bootstrap techniques, to compare parameters from two populations. This test allows one to compare the MESOR, the amplitude, and the acrophase of each fitted component, as well as the global amplitude, orthophase, and bathyphase estimated when all fitted components are harmonics of a fundamental period. The idea is to calculate a confidence interval for the difference of the parameters of interest. If this interval does not contain zero, it can be concluded that the parameters from the two models are different with high probability. An estimation of p-value for the corresponding test can also be calculated. Both methods are illustrated with an example, based on clinical data. The nonparametric test can also be applied to paired data, a special situation of great interest in practice. By the use of similar bootstrap techniques, we illustrate how to construct confidence intervals for any rhythmometric parameter estimated from population multiple components models, including the orthophase, bathyphase, and global amplitude. These tests for comparison of parameters among populations are a needed tool when modeling the nonsinusoidal rhythmic behavior of hybrid data by population multiple component analysis.},\n  keywords = {Biological rhythms,Hybrid time series,Parameter testing,Periodic regression,Population multiple components analysis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VPK7XZXG/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162483,"version":0},"$loki":633},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1593,"entry":"@article{Fernandez2009,\n  title = {Chronobiological Analysis Techniques.

Methods of linear least-squares estimation have been designed for the detection of periodic components in sparse and noisy time series (as they are usually present in clinical situations). They include the single and population-mean cosinor methods. In cases where more than one period is statistically significant over the span of time investigated, or when the waveform is non-sinusoidal, the use of multiple components analysis to fit a model consisting of several cosine functions (harmonics or not from a given fundamental period) is recommended. We describe these methods, from the characterization of the underlying models to the process of parameter estimation. As an application example, we describe the modelling of the circadian variation of blood pressure (BP). In most individuals, BP presents a morning increase, a small postprandial valley and a deeper descent during nocturnal rest. This pattern can be easily modelled by means of a model with periods of 24 and 12 hours.

Sleeping at the 'wrong' internal time can jeopardise health and safety, and we therefore need a good quantification of this phenomenon. Here, we propose a novel method to quantify the mistiming of sleep-wake rhythms and demonstrate its versatility in day workers and shift workers.

With increasing levels of circadian strain, the resulting shapes change systematically from small, connected forms to large and fragmented patterns. Our method shows good congruence with published measures of circadian misalignment (i.e., Inter-daily Stability and Behavioural Entrainment'), but offers added value as to its requirements, e.g., being computable for sleep logs and questionnaires.

The distribution of myocardial sympathetic processes is finely regulated by the secretion of limiting amounts of pro-survival neurotrophic factors by cardiac cells. Norepinephrine release by the neurons rapidly modulates myocardial electrophysiology, and increases the rate and force of cardiomyocyte contractions. Sympathetic processes establish direct interaction with cardiomyocytes, characterized by the presence of neurotransmitter vesicles and reduced cell-cell distance. Whether such contacts have a functional role in both neurotrophin- and catecholamine-dependent communication between the two cell types, is poorly understood. In this review we will address the effects of the sympathetic neuron activity on the myocardium and the hypothesis that the direct neuro-cardiac contact might have a key role both in norepinephrine and neurotrophin mediated signaling.

In order to establish an atrial filtration (AF) model in our laboratory, we profiled several commonly used murine AF models. We initially evaluated a pharmacological model of acute carbachol (CCh) treatment plus atrial burst pacing in C57BL/6 mice. In an effort to observe micro-reentrant circuits indicative of authentic AF, we employed optical mapping imaging in isolated mouse hearts. While CCh reduced atrial refractoriness and increased atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability, the left atrial (LA) excitation patterns were rather regular without reentrant circuits or wavelets. Therefore, the atrial tachyarrhythmia resembled high frequency atrial flutter, not typical AF per se. We next examined both a chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion model and the surgical model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC), which have both been reported to induce atrial and ventricular structural changes that serve as a substrates for micro-reentrant AF. Although we observed some extent of atrial remodeling such as fibrosis or enlarged LA diameter, burst pacing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability did not differ from control mice in either model. This again suggested that an AF-like pathophysiology is difficult to demonstrate in the mouse. To continue searching for a valid murine AF model, we studied mice with a cardiac-specific deficiency (KO) in liver kinase B1 (Cardiac-LKB1), which has been reported to exhibit spontaneous AF. Indeed, the electrocardiograms (ECG) of conscious Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice exhibited no P waves and had irregular RR intervals, which are characteristics of AF. Histological evaluation of Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice revealed dilated and fibrotic atria, again consistent with AF. However, atrial electrograms and optical mapping revealed that electrical activity was limited to the sino-atrial node area with no electrical conduction into the atrial myocardium beyond. Thus, Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice have severe atrial myopathy or atrial standstill, but not AF. In summary, the atrial tachyarrhythmias we observed in the four murine models were distinct from typical human AF, which often exhibits micro- or macro-reentrant atrial circuits. Our results suggest that the four murine AF models we examined may not reflect human AF well, and raise a cautionary note for use of those murine models to study AF.},\n  issue = {1 January},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/U9NKP89I/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162508,"version":0},"$loki":639},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":845,"entry":"@article{Fukuda2015,\n  title = {Cardiac {{Innervation}} and {{Sudden Cardiac Death}}},\n  author = {Fukuda, Keiichi and Kanazawa, Hideaki and Aizawa, Yoshiyasu and Ardell, Jeffrey L. and Shivkumar, Kalyanam},\n  date = {2015-06-05},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation Research},\n  volume = {116},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {26044253},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {2005--2019},\n  issn = {15244571},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304679},\n  url = {https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304679},\n  urldate = {2018-09-27},\n  abstract = {Afferent and efferent cardiac neurotransmission via the cardiac nerves intricately modulates nearly all physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, lusitropy, and inotropy). Afferent information from the heart is transmitted to higher levels of the nervous system for processing (intrinsic cardiac nervous system, extracardiac-intrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem, and higher centers), which ultimately results in efferent cardiomotor neural impulses (via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). This system forms interacting feedback loops that provide physiological stability for maintaining normal rhythm and life-sustaining circulation. This system also ensures that there is fine-tuned regulation of sympathetic–parasympathetic balance in the heart under normal and stressed states in the short (beat to beat), intermediate (minutes to hours), and long term (days to years). This important neurovisceral/autonomic nervous system also plays a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Transdifferentiation of neurons in heart failure, functional denervation, cardiac and extracardiac neural remodeling has also been identified and characterized during the progression of disease. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular processes governing innervation and the functional control of the myocardium in health and disease provide a rational mechanistic basis for the development of neuraxial therapies for preventing sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmias. Advances in cellular, molecular, and bioengineering realms have underscored the emergence of this area as an important avenue of scientific inquiry and therapeutic intervention.},\n  isbn = {1875-6557 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r1573-403X (Linking)},\n  keywords = {arrhythmias,autonomic nervous system,cardiac,death,done,physiopathology,sudden cardiac},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ILFH6V7I/m-api-69abf9d0-e9ee-b3ef-1564-9ce51ec10c59.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162515,"version":0},"$loki":640},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1225,"entry":"@article{Furlan2003,\n  title = {Cardiovascular Reflexes Mediated by Sympathetic Afferent Fibers.},\n  author = {Malliani, Alberto and Pagani, Massimo and Pizzinelli, Paolo and Furlan, Raffaello and Guzzetti, Stefano},\n  date = {1983},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the autonomic nervous system},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {3-4},\n  eprint = {6875194},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {295--301},\n  issn = {0165-1838},\n  doi = {10.1016/0165-1838(83)90082-6},\n  abstract = {In this paper the experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that excitatory sympathetic reflexes may participate in the tonic control of the cardiovascular system is discussed.

However, the role of positive emotions triggering TTS remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of patients with TTS following pleasant events, which are distinct from the stressful or undesirable episodes commonly triggering TTS. METHODS AND RESULTS Takotsubo syndrome patients with preceding pleasant events were compared to those with negative emotional triggers from the International Takotsubo Registry. Of 1750 TTS patients, we identified a total of 485 with a definite emotional trigger. Of these, 4.1\\% (n = 20) presented with pleasant preceding events and 95.9\\% (n = 465) with unequivocal negative emotional events associated with TTS. Interestingly, clinical presentation of patients with 'happy heart syndrome' was similar to those with the 'broken heart syndrome' including symptoms such as chest pain [89.5\\% (17/19) vs. 90.2\\% (412/457), P = 1.0]. Similarly, electrocardiographic parameters, laboratory findings, and 1-year outcome did not differ. However, in a post hoc analysis, a disproportionate higher prevalence of midventricular involvement was noted in 'happy hearts' compared with 'broken hearts' (35.0 vs. 16.3\\%, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION Our data illustrate that TTS can be triggered by not only negative but also positive life events. While patient characteristics were similar between groups, the midventricular TTS type was more prevalent among the 'happy hearts' than among the 'broken hearts'. Presumably, despite their distinct nature, happy and sad life events may share similar final common emotional pathways, which can ultimately trigger TTS.},\n  isbn = {0195-668X, 1522-9645},\n  keywords = {Acute heart failure,Brain-heart connection,Broken heart syndrome,Takotsubo syndrome},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/T25JTNF4/2016 - Ghadri et al. - Happy heart syndrome Role of positive emotional stress in takotsubo syndrome.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162531,"version":0},"$loki":644},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1630,"entry":"@article{Goertz1993,\n  title = {Influence of High Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia on Left Ventricular Contractility Assessed Using the End‐systolic Pressure‐length Relationship},\n  author = {Goertz, A W and Seeling, W and Heinrich, H and Lindner, K H and Schirmer, U},\n  date = {1993},\n  journaltitle = {Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica},\n  volume = {37},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {8424292},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {38--44},\n  issn = {13996576},\n  doi = {10.1111/j.1399-6576.1993.tb03595.x},\n  abstract = {The effect of high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) on left ventricular contractility was studied in a prospective clinical trial.

There was no significant difference in systolic or diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, left ventricular end‐systolic and end‐diastolic cross‐sectional areas and left ventricular wall stress between the four groups. Left ventricular maximum elastance as a measure of left ventricular contractility was significantly (P{$<$}0.001) reduced in Groups 1 and 2 [8.1 (±3.5) and 9.6 (±4.4) kPa · cm‐1, respectively] as compared to Groups 3 and 4 [18.4 (±8.8) and 17.7 (±7.7) kPa · cm‐1, respectively]. No significant difference could be demonstrated between Groups 1 and 2 or between Groups 3 and 4. It is concluded that high TEA severely alters left ventricular contractility even in subjects without pre‐existing cardiac disease. © 1993 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Fonden},\n  keywords = {Anesthetic techniques,blockade,contractility,echocardiography,epidural,heart,sympathetic nervous system},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/XHALYKX9/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162534,"version":0},"$loki":645},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1639,"entry":"@article{Goldberger1999a,\n  title = {Sympathovagal Balance: How Should We Measure It?},\n  author = {Goldberger, Jeffrey J},\n  date = {1999-04-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology},\n  volume = {276},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {H1273-H1280},\n  issn = {0363-6135},\n  doi = {10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.4.H1273},\n  url = {https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.4.H1273},\n  urldate = {2020-08-27},\n  abstract = {There are complex interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the sinus node. The concept of “sympathovagal balance” reflects the autonomic state resulting from the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Despite widespread usage of a variety of heart rate (HR) variability parameters as indexes of sympathovagal balance, no index has been validated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This study evaluated the utility of HR, HR variability, and a new parameter termed the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) as indexes of sympathovagal balance. The ideal parameter had to satisfy the following criteria: 1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; 2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and 3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. Volunteers [8 men, 6 women; mean age 28.5 ± 4.8 (SD) yr] were evaluated for the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and blockade on HR and HR variability. VSE was defined as the ratio of the R-R interval to the intrinsic R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval consistently changed in the expected directions with parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and blockade. A general linearized model was used to evaluate the response of each parameter. VSE and R-R interval had r 2 values of 0.847 and 0.852, respectively. Natural logarithm of the low-frequency power had an r 2 value of 0.781 with lower r 2 values for all the other HR variability parameters. The coefficient of variation was also lowest for each condition tested for the VSE and the R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval best satisfy the criteria for the ideal index of sympathovagal balance. Because it is impractical under most conditions to measure the VSE as the index of sympathovagal balance, the most suitable index is the R-R interval.},\n  keywords = {autonomic,heart rate,parasympathetic,sympathetic},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/PCH9T972/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162538,"version":0},"$loki":646},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1676,"entry":"@article{Goldberger2017,\n  title = {Autonomic {{Tone}} and {{Atrial Fibrillation}}: {{A Double-Edged Sword}}?},\n  author = {Goldberger, Jeffrey J and Mitrani, Raul D},\n  date = {2017},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {69},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {28104072},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {300--302},\n  issn = {15583597},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2016.11.021},\n  keywords = {arrhythmia,heart rate variability,pathophysiology,substrate},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/6WM5BGWS/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162540,"version":0},"$loki":647},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1717,"entry":"@article{Goldberger2019,\n  title = {Autonomic {{Nervous System Dysfunction}}: {{JACC Focus Seminar}}},\n  author = {Goldberger, Jeffrey J. and Arora, Rishi and Buckley, Una and Shivkumar, Kalyanam},\n  date = {2019-03-19},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {73},\n  number = {10},\n  eprint = {30871703},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1189--1206},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier USA}},\n  issn = {15583597},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2018.12.064},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC6958998/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-09-24},\n  abstract = {Autonomic nervous system control of the heart is a dynamic process in both health and disease.

Claude Bernard, Walter B. Cannon and Hans Selye provided key founding concepts for the current view. Bernard introduced the idea of the internal environment bathing cells - the milieu intérieur - maintained by continual compensatory changes of bodily functions. Cannon coined the word, \"homeostasis,\" referring to a set of acceptable ranges of values for internal variables. Cannon taught that threats to homeostasis evoke activation of the sympathoadrenal system as a functional unit. Selye defined stress as a state characterized by a uniform response pattern, regardless of the particular stressor, that could lead to long-term pathologic changes. \" Allostasis\" was introduced as a concept in recognition that there is no single ideal set of steady-state conditions in life; instead, setpoints and other response criteria change continuously. Stress is now viewed neither as a perturbation nor a stereotyped response pattern but as a condition characterized by a perceived discrepancy between information about a monitored variable and criteria for eliciting patterned effector responses. Different stressors elicit different patterns of activation of the sympathetic nervous, adrenomedullary hormonal, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and other effectors, closing negative feedback loops. This systems concept of stress yields predictions that observation or experimentation can test and that are applicable to normal physiology and to a variety of acute and chronic disorders. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.},\n  keywords = {Allostasis,Baroreceptors,Cardiovascular disease,Distress,Exercise,Homeostasis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/R7FFEWLR/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162554,"version":0},"$loki":650},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1898,"entry":"@article{Goldstein2012,\n  title = {Neurocardiology: {{Therapeutic Implications}} for {{Cardiovascular Disease}}},\n  author = {Goldstein, David S.},\n  date = {2012-04},\n  journaltitle = {Cardiovascular Therapeutics},\n  volume = {30},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {21108771},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {e89},\n  publisher = {{NIH Public Access}},\n  issn = {17555914},\n  doi = {10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00244.x},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC4893308/?report=abstract},\n  urldate = {2020-09-24},\n  abstract = {The term \"neurocardiology\" refers to physiologic and pathophysiological interplays of the nervous and cardiovascular systems.

Scientific integrative medicine is not a treatment method or discipline but a way of thinking that applies systems concepts to acute and chronic disorders of regulation. Some of these concepts include stability by negative feedback regulation, multiple effectors, effector sharing, instability by positive feedback loops, allostasis, and allostatic load. Scientific integrative medicine builds on systems biology but is also distinct in several ways. A large variety of drugs and non-drug treatments are now available or under study for neurocardiologic disorders in which catecholamine systems are hyperfunctional or hypofunctional.

In current systems biology, however, homeostasis seems almost invisible. Is homeostasis a key goal driving body processes, or is it an emergent mechanistic fact? In this perspective piece, I propose that the integrative physiological and systems biological viewpoints about homeostasis reflect different epistemologies, different philosophies of knowledge. Integrative physiology is concept driven. It attempts to explain biological phenomena by continuous formation of theories that experimentation or observation can test. In integrative physiology, \"function\" refers to goals or purposes. Systems biology is data driven. It explains biological phenomena in terms of \"omics\"-i.e., genomics, gene expression, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-it depicts the data in computer models of complex cascades or networks, and it makes predictions from the models. In systems biology, \"function\" refers more to mechanisms than to goals. The integrative physiologist emphasizes homeostasis of internal variables such as Pco2 and blood pressure. The systems biologist views these emphases as teleological and unparsimonious in that the \"regulated variable\" (e.g., arterial Pco2 and blood pressure) and the \"regulator\" (e.g., the \"carbistat\" and \"barostat\") are unobservable constructs. The integrative physiologist views systems biological explanations as not really explanations but descriptions that cannot account for phenomena we humans believe exist, although they cannot be observed directly, such as feelings and, ultimately, the conscious mind. This essay reviews the history of the two epistemologies, emphasizing autonomic neuroscience. I predict rapprochement of integrative physiology with systems biology.

With respect to the myogenic factor it is controversial whether it plays a role in adjustments of coronary vascular tone. Metabolic processes are possibly integrated at the level of the myocardial cell PO2 which is the resultant of oxygen supply and need, which in turn depend on the myocardial contractile activity as well as other biochemical processes. A decrease in myocardial PO2 gives rise to the release of the vasodilator metabolite adenosine. Nevertheless, other chemical factors (H+, K+, osmolarity) known to be released by the heart (which by themselves are poor and transient coronary vasodilators and whose release does not correspond with changes in coronary resistance) may play a role by modulating the coronary sensitivity to adenosine and other factors. © 1975.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ARN6BZSQ/m-api-4e834cf9-812e-66e1-35a8-54933480e091.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162566,"version":0},"$loki":653},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":642,"entry":"@article{Gould2018a,\n  title = {Coronary {{Physiology Beyond Coronary Flow Reserve}} in {{Microvascular Angina}}},\n  author = {Gould, K.

Several intracardiac ganglia have been demonstrated to potently influence cardiac rate [the sinoatrial (SA) ganglion], atrioventricular (AV) conduction (the AV ganglion), or left ventricular contractility (the cranioventricular ganglion). However, there are numerous ganglia found throughout the heart whose functions are poorly characterized. One such ganglion, the posterior atrial (PA) ganglion, is found in a fat pad on the rostral dorsal surface of the right atrium. We have investigated the potential impact of this ganglion on cardiac rate and AV conduction. We report that microinjections of a ganglionic blocker into the PA ganglion significantly attenuates the negative chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation without significantly influencing negative dromotropic effects. Because prior evidence indicates that the PA ganglion does not project to the SA node, we neuroanatomically tested the hypothesis that the PA ganglion mediates its effect on cardiac rate through an interganglionic projection to the SA ganglion. Subsequent to micro-injections of the retrograde tracer fast blue into the SA ganglion, {$>$}70\\% of the retrogradely labeled neurons found within five intracardiac ganglia throughout the heart were observed in the PA ganglion. The neuroanatomic data further indicate that intraganglionic neuronal circuits are found within the SA ganglion. The present data support the hypothesis that two interacting cardiac centers, i.e., the SA and PA ganglia, mediate the peripheral parasympathetic control of cardiac rate.

While myocardial reperfusion undoubtedly improves patient prognosis, it remains unknown whether reperfusion therapy also attenuates the dangerous increase in SNA. This study aimed to investigate the effect of time-dependent coronary reperfusion therapy on cardiac SNA following acute MI. Electrophysiological recordings of cardiac efferent SNA were performed in urethane-anaesthetized rats following ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (i.e., MI) for either 15 or 45 min, followed by ‘early’ or ‘delayed’ reperfusion, respectively. Another group of rats had permanent ischemia with no reperfusion. Forty-five minutes of ischemia induced a 55 \\% increase in efferent SNA. Subsequent ‘delayed’ reperfusion was ineffective at ameliorating further increases in SNA (maximal 153 \\% increase), so that MI-induced increases in SNA mirrored that observed in rats with permanent MI. Although SNA did not increase during 15 min of ischemia, it did significantly increase, albeit delayed, during the subsequent reperfusion period (max. 75 \\% increase). Importantly, however, this increase in SNA, which tended to be lower in the ‘early’-reperfusion group, was matched with a lower incidence of arrhythmias and mortality rate, compared to the ‘delayed’-reperfusion and permanent-MI groups. These results highlight that ‘prompt’ coronary reperfusion, before SNA becomes activated, may provide a crucial window of opportunity for improving outcome.

MI was produced in guinea pigs by ligation of the coronary artery and associated vein on the dorsal surface of the heart. Animals were recovered for 4, 7, 14, or 50. days. Intracellular voltage recordings were obtained in whole mounts of the cardiac neuronal plexus to determine passive and active neuronal properties of IC neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an immediate and persistent increase in the percentage of IC neurons immunoreactive for neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Examination of individual neuronal properties demonstrated that afterhyperpolarizing potentials were significantly decreased in both amplitude and time course of recovery at 7. days post-MI. These parameters returned to control values by 50. days post-MI. Synaptic efficacy, as determined by the stimulation of axonal inputs, was enhanced at 7. days post-MI only. Neuronal excitability in absence of agonist challenge was unchanged following MI. Norepinephrine increased IC excitability to intracellular current injections, a response that was augmented post-MI. Angiotensin II potentiation of norepinephrine and bethanechol-induced excitability, evident in controls, was abolished post-MI. This study demonstrates that MI induces both persistent and transient changes in IC neuronal functions immediately following injury.

Although resuscitation rates are generally improving throughout the world, the majority of individuals who experience a sudden cardiac arrest will not survive. SCD most often develops in older adults with acquired structural heart disease, but it also rarely occurs in the young, where it is more commonly because of inherited disorders. Coronary heart disease is known to be the most common pathology underlying SCD, followed by cardiomyopathies, inherited arrhythmia syndromes, and valvular heart disease. During the past 3 decades, declines in SCD rates have not been as steep as for other causes of coronary heart disease deaths, and there is a growing fraction of SCDs not due to coronary heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly among certain subsets of the population. The growing heterogeneity of the pathologies and mechanisms underlying SCD present major challenges for SCD prevention, which are magnified further by a frequent lack of recognition of the underlying cardiac condition before death. Multifaceted preventative approaches, which address risk factors in seemingly low-risk and known high-risk populations, will be required to decrease the burden of SCD. In this Compendium, we review the wide-ranging spectrum of epidemiology underlying SCD within both the general population and in high-risk subsets with established cardiac disease placing an emphasis on recent global trends, remaining uncertainties, and potential targeted preventive strategies.},\n  isbn = {0009-7330},\n  keywords = {cardiac,cardiomyopathies,coronary disease,death,epidemiology,sudden},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/QHX88MGC/2015 - Hayashi, Shimizu, Albert - The Spectrum of Epidemiology Underlying Sudden Cardiac Death.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162602,"version":0},"$loki":662},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1351,"entry":"@article{He2013,\n  title = {The Effects of Atrial Ganglionated Plexi Stimulation on Ventricular Electrophysiology in a Normal Canine Heart},\n  author = {He, Bo and Lu, Zhibing and He, Wenbo and Huang, Bing and Yu, Lilei and Wu, Liu and Cui, Bo and Hu, Xiaorong and Jiang, Hong},\n  date = {2013},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology},\n  volume = {37},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {1--8},\n  issn = {1383875X},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10840-012-9774-2},\n  abstract = {Aims: Atrial ganglionated plexi (GP) have been shown to modulate atrial electrophysiology and play an important role in atrial fibrillation initiation and maintenance.

Arterial and right atrial pressures and renal sympathetic nerve activity were recorded in dogs before and after administration of single and double programmed ventricular stimuli. In a group of 10 dogs after single extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 18 ± 2 mm Hg (mean ± SEM) while renal sympathetic nerve activity increased by 39 ± 15 impulses/s. These changes were directly related to degree of stimulus prematurity. After double extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 22 ± 2 mm Hg whereas renal sympathetic activity increased by 55 ± 8 impulses/s. In an additional four dogs, double extrastimuli decreased arterial pressure (−34 ± 1 mm Hg) and increased cardiac (86 ± 16\\%) and renal (82 ± 12\\%) sympathetic traffic. After si-noaortic denervation, neither single nor double programmed ventricular stimuli resulted in alterations in cardiac or renal sympathetic nerve activity.

The Y2 receptor was immunofluorescently colocalized with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the guinea pig sinoatrial node. The effect of NPY in the presence of various enzyme inhibitors was then tested on the heart rate response to vagal nerve stimulation in isolated guinea pig sinoatrial node/right vagal nerve preparations and also on 3H-acetylcholine release from right atria during field stimulation. NPY reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation at 1, 3 and 5 Hz (significant at 100 nM and reaching a plateau at 250 nM NPY, p {$<$} 0.05, n = 6) but not to the stable analogue of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine (30, 60 or 90 nM, n = 6) which produced similar degrees of bradycardia. The reduced vagal response was abolished by the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 (1 μM, n = 4).

We hypothesize that impaired bradycardia to peripheral vagal stimulation following high-level sympathetic drive is due to sympatho-vagal crosstalk by the adrenergic co-transmitters galanin and neuropeptide-Y (NPY). Moreover we hypothesize that galanin acts similarly to NPY by reducing vagal acetylcholine release via a receptor mediated, protein kinase-dependent pathway. Prolonged right stellate ganglion stimulation (10Hz, 2min, in the presence of 10μM metoprolol) in an isolated guinea pig atrial preparation with dual autonomic innervation leads to a significant (p{$<$}0.05) reduction in the magnitude of vagal bradycardia (5Hz) maintained over the subsequent 20min (n=6). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of galanin in a small number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons from freshly dissected stellate ganglion tissue sections. Following 3days of tissue culture however, most stellate neurons expressed galanin. Stellate stimulation caused the release of low levels of galanin and significantly higher levels of NPY into the surrounding perfusate (n=6, using ELISA). The reduction in vagal bradycardia post sympathetic stimulation was partially reversed by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 after 10min (1μM, n=5), and completely reversed with the NPY Y 2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 at all time points (1μM, n=6). Exogenous galanin (n=6, 50-500nM) also reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation but had no effect on the response to carbamylcholine that produced similar degrees of bradycardia (n=6). Galanin (500nM) also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine from isolated atria during field stimulation (5Hz, n=5). The effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia could be abolished by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 (n=5). Importantly the GalR 1 receptor was immunofluorescently co-localised with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the sinoatrial node. The protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin (100nM, n=6) abolished the effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia whilst the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (500nM, n=6) had no effect. These results demonstrate that prolonged sympathetic activation releases the slowly diffusing adrenergic co-transmitter galanin in addition to NPY, and that this contributes to the attenuation in vagal bradycardia via a reduction in acetylcholine release. This effect is mediated by GalR 1 receptors on vagal neurons coupled to protein kinase C dependent signalling pathways. The role of galanin may become more important following an acute injury response where galanin expression is increased. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},\n  keywords = {Acetylcholine,Autonomic nervous system,Co-transmitters,Heart rate,Sympathetic,Vagus},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/X63W9BSA/m-api-194635b0-983a-dc69-721e-37696580f351.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162629,"version":0},"$loki":668},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2118,"entry":"@article{Herring2015a,\n  title = {Autonomic Control of the Heart: {{Going}} beyond the Classical Neurotransmitters},\n  author = {Herring, Neil},\n  date = {2015-04-01},\n  journaltitle = {Experimental Physiology},\n  volume = {100},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {25344273},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {354--358},\n  publisher = {{Blackwell Publishing Ltd}},\n  issn = {1469445X},\n  doi = {10.1113/expphysiol.2014.080184},\n  abstract = {Acute myocardial infarction and congestive cardiac failure are characterized by high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive. In these conditions, sympathetic neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) can be released in addition to noradrenaline, and plasma levels correlate with infarct size and mortality. Even in the presence of β-blockers, NPY is able to bind to its own receptors located on cholinergic ganglia and ventricular myocytes. In this symposium report, I review the evidence that NPY can inhibit acetylcholine release during vagus nerve stimulation and limit the subsequent bradycardia. I also present preliminary, as yet unpublished data, demonstrating that NPY may be pro-arrhythmic by directly influencing ventricular electrophysiology. Targeting NPY receptors pharmacologically may therefore be a useful therapeutic strategy both to reduce heart rate and to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Such medications would be expected to act synergistically with β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and implantable cardiac devices, such as defibrillators and vagus nerve stimulators.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/78W8G6KT/Experimental Physiology - 2014 - Herring - Autonomic control of the heart  going beyond the classical neurotransmitters.pdf;/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/8WW3IEJR/m-api-5416d7ac-d4e6-5d19-0656-d93c0270f225.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162631,"version":0},"$loki":669},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1252,"entry":"@article{Hirsch2013,\n  title = {Interaction of the Heart and Its Close and Distant Neighbours: Report of the {{Meeting}} of the {{ESC Working Groups Myocardial Function}} and {{Cellular Biology}}},\n  author = {Hirsch, Emilio and Hilfiker-Kleiner, Denise and Balligand, Jean-Luc and Tarone, Guido and De Windt, Leon and Bauersachs, Johann and Ferdinandy, Peter and Davidson, Sean and Hausenloy, Derek J and Schulz, Rainer},\n  date = {2013-09-01},\n  journaltitle = {Cardiovascular Research},\n  volume = {99},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {23860811},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {595--599},\n  issn = {0008-6363},\n  doi = {10.1093/cvr/cvt179},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cvr/cvt179},\n  urldate = {2019-05-27}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162633,"version":0},"$loki":670},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2120,"entry":"@article{Hoang2020,\n  title = {Cardiac Sympathetic Activation Circumvents High-Dose Beta Blocker Therapy in Part through Release of Neuropeptide {{Y}}},\n  author = {Hoang, Jonathan D. and Salavatian, Siamak and Yamaguchi, Naoko and Swid, Mohammed Amer and Vaseghi, Marmar},\n  date = {2020-06-04},\n  journaltitle = {JCI Insight},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {11},\n  eprint = {32493842},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  publisher = {{American Society for Clinical Investigation}},\n  issn = {23793708},\n  doi = {10.1172/JCI.INSIGHT.135519},\n  abstract = {The sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Many patients, however, experience VT despite maximal doses of beta blocker therapy, possibly due to the effects of sympathetic cotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY). The purpose of this study was to determine, in a porcine model, whether propranolol at doses higher than clinically recommended could block ventricular electrophysiological effects of sympathoexcitation via stellate ganglia stimulation, and if any residual effects are mediated by NPY. Greater release of cardiac NPY was observed at higher sympathetic stimulation frequencies (10 and 20 vs. 4 Hz). Despite treatment with even higher doses of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg), electrophysiological effects of sympathetic stimulation remained, with residual shortening of activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate of action potential duration (APD). Adjuvant treatment with the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO 3304, however, reduced these electrophysiological effects while augmenting inotropy. These data demonstrate that high-dose beta blocker therapy is insufficient to block electrophysiological effects of sympathoexcitation, and a portion of these electrical effects in vivo are mediated by NPY. Y1 receptor blockade may represent a promising adjuvant therapy to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/432JZKHZ/135519.2-20210920104533-covered-e0fd13ba177f913fd3156f593ead4cfd.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162637,"version":0},"$loki":671},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1207,"entry":"@article{Hoover2009,\n  title = {Localization of Multiple Neurotransmitters in Surgically Derived Specimens of Human Atrial Ganglia},\n  author = {Hoover, D.

While this system has been studied extensively in animal models, far less is known about the intrinsic cardiac nervous system of humans. This study was initiated to anatomically identify neurotransmitters associated with the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) of the human heart. Biopsies of epicardial fat containing a portion of the RAGP were collected from eight patients during cardiothoracic surgery and processed for immunofluorescent detection of specific neuronal markers. Colocalization of markers was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Most intrinsic cardiac neuronal somata displayed immunoreactivity for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the nitrergic marker neuronal nitric oxide synthase. A subpopulation of intrinsic cardiac neurons also stained for noradrenergic markers. While most intrinsic cardiac neurons received cholinergic innervation evident as punctate immunostaining for the high affinity choline transporter, some lacked cholinergic inputs. Moreover, peptidergic, nitrergic, and noradrenergic nerves provided substantial innervation of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. These findings demonstrate that the human RAGP has a complex neurochemical anatomy, which includes the presence of a dual cholinergic/nitrergic phenotype for most of its neurons, the presence of noradrenergic markers in a subpopulation of neurons, and innervation by a host of neurochemically distinct nerves. The putative role of multiple neurotransmitters in controlling intrinsic cardiac neurons and mediating efferent signaling to the heart indicates the possibility of novel therapeutic targets for arrhythmia prevention. © 2009 IBRO.},\n  keywords = {cardiac ganglia,cholinergic,intrinsic cardiac nervous system,neuronal nitric oxide synthase,neuropeptides,noradrenergic},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GGLEP6CF/m-api-6889180d-b6fc-8535-515d-35fcbb108d5d.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162640,"version":0},"$loki":672},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1116,"entry":"@article{Hu2004,\n  title = {Endogenous Circadian Rhythm in an Index of Cardiac Vulnerability Independent of Changes in Behavior.},\n  author = {Hu, Kun and Ivanov, Plamen Ch and Hilton, Michael F and Chen, Zhi and Ayers, R Timothy and Stanley, H Eugene and Shea, Steven A},\n  date = {2004-12-28},\n  journaltitle = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America},\n  volume = {101},\n  number = {52},\n  eprint = {15611476},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {18223--7},\n  publisher = {{National Academy of Sciences}},\n  issn = {0027-8424},\n  doi = {10.1073/pnas.0408243101},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15611476},\n  urldate = {2018-05-31},\n  abstract = {There exists a robust day/night pattern in the incidence of adverse cardiac events with a peak at approximately 10 a.m. This peak traditionally has been attributed to day/night patterns in behaviors affecting cardiac function in vulnerable individuals. However, influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker independent from behaviors may also affect cardiac control. Heartbeat dynamics under healthy conditions exhibit robust complex fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal structures, which break down under pathologic conditions. We hypothesize that these dynamical features of the healthy human heartbeat have an endogenous circadian rhythm that brings the features closer to those observed under pathologic conditions at the endogenous circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m. We investigate heartbeat dynamics in healthy subjects recorded throughout a 10-day protocol wherein the sleep/wake and behavior cycles are desynchronized from the endogenous circadian cycle, enabling assessment of circadian factors while controlling for behavior-related factors. We demonstrate that the scaling exponent characterizing temporal correlations in heartbeat dynamics does exhibit a significant circadian rhythm (with a sharp peak at the circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m.), which is independent from scheduled behaviors and mean heart rate. Cardiac dynamics under pathologic conditions such as congestive heart failure also are associated with a larger value of the scaling exponent of the interbeat interval. Thus, the sharp peak in the scaling exponent at the circadian phase coinciding with the period of highest cardiac vulnerability observed in epidemiological studies suggests that endogenous circadian-mediated influences on cardiac control may be involved in the day/night pattern of adverse cardiac events in vulnerable individuals.},\n  isbn = {0027-8424},\n  keywords = {Adult,Behavior,Biological Clocks,Circadian Rhythm,Circadian Rhythm: physiology,Female,Heart,Heart Rate,Heart: anatomy \\& histology,Heart: physiology,Humans,Male,Myocardial Contraction,Myocardium,Myocardium: metabolism,Myocardium: pathology,Time Factors},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/UUIKUWWC/Hu et al. - 2004 - Endogenous circadian rhythm in an index of cardiac vulnerability independent of changes in behavior.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162644,"version":0},"$loki":673},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":922,"entry":"@article{Huang2017,\n  title = {Cardiac {{Innervation}} and the {{Autonomic Nervous System}} in {{Sudden Cardiac Death}}},\n  author = {Huang, William A. and Boyle, Noel G. and Vaseghi, Marmar},\n  date = {2017},\n  journaltitle = {Cardiac Electrophysiology Clinics},\n  volume = {9},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {29173409},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {665--679},\n  issn = {18779190},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.ccep.2017.08.002},\n  abstract = {Neural remodeling in the autonomic nervous system contributes to sudden cardiac death.

It is widely known that EADs are promoted by increasing inward currents and/or decreasing outward currents, a condition called reduced repolarization reserve. Recent studies based on bifurcation theories show that EADs are caused by a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation, bringing in further mechanistic insights into the genesis and dynamics of EADs. In this study, we investigated the EAD properties, such as the EAD amplitude, the inter-EAD interval, and the latency of the first EAD, and their major determinants. We first made predictions based on the bifurcation theory and then validated them in physiologically more detailed action potential models. These properties were investigated by varying one parameter at a time or using parameter sets randomly drawn from assigned intervals. The theoretical and simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Our major findings are that the EAD amplitude and takeoff potential exhibit a negative linear correlation; the inter-EAD interval is insensitive to the maximum ionic current conductance but mainly determined by the kinetics of I Ca,L and the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation; and both inter-EAD interval and latency vary largely from model to model. Most of the model results generally agree with experimental observations in isolated ventricular myocytes. However, a major discrepancy between modeling results and experimental observations is that the inter-EAD intervals observed in experiments are mainly between 200 and 500 ms, irrespective of species, while those of the mathematical models exhibit a much wider range with some models exhibiting inter-EAD intervals less than 100 ms. Our simulations show that the cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the difference in I Ca,L recovery properties in different mathematical models, which needs to be addressed in future action potential model development.},\n  isbn = {1111111111},\n  keywords = {Action potentials,Bifurcation theory,Computer modeling,Guinea pigs,Ionic current,Muscle cells,Rabbits,Simulation and modeling},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ZGEHL4AY/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162651,"version":0},"$loki":675},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1715,"entry":"@article{Ibrahim2019,\n  title = {Cardiac {{Dysfunction}} in {{Neurocritical Care}}: {{An Autonomic Perspective}}},\n  author = {Ibrahim, Mohammad S. and Samuel, Bennson and Mohamed, Wazim and Suchdev, Kushak},\n  date = {2019-06-15},\n  journaltitle = {Neurocritical Care},\n  volume = {30},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {30484009},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {508--521},\n  publisher = {{Humana Press Inc.}},\n  issn = {15560961},\n  doi = {10.1007/s12028-018-0636-3},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-0636-3},\n  urldate = {2020-09-24},\n  abstract = {A number of neurologic disorders can cause cardiac dysfunction by involving the conductive system and contractile apparatus of the heart. This is especially prominent in the neurocritical care setting where the spectrum of cardiac dysfunction due to acute neurologic injury ranges from trivial and isolated electrocardiographic changes to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death (Table 1). The mechanism of these cardiac complications is complex and not fully understood. An understanding of the neuroanatomical structures and pathways is of immense importance to comprehend the underlying pathophysiology that culminates as cardiac damage and dysregulation. Once the process is initiated, it can complicate and adversely affect the outcome of primary neurologic conditions commonly seen in the neurocritical care setting. Not only are these cardiac disorders under-recognized, there is a paucity of data to formulate evidence-based guidelines regarding early detection, acute management, and preventive strategies. However, certain details of clinical features and their course combined with location of primary neurologic lesion on neuroimaging and data obtained from laboratory investigations can be of great value to develop a strategy to appropriately manage these patients and to prevent adverse outcome from these cardiac complications. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction due to catastrophic neurologic conditions or due to stress of critical illness.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that such denervation supersensitivity is arrhythmogenic. Ventricular arrhythmias were elicited by programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) during a control period, during bilateral stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (4 msec pulses, 4 Hz and 3 mA), and during the infusion of norepinephrine (0.5 μg/kg/min). Study groups consisted of 14 sham-operated dogs, 16 dogs with phenol painted over a diagonal branch, 13 dogs with latex embolization of a diagonal branch that resulted in transmural myocardial infarction, 14 dogs with a one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch producing nontransmural myocardial infarction, and 12 dogs undergoing both phenol painting and one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch. Four to 22 days after the first operation, PVS was performed in anesthetized, open-chest dogs after neural decentralization of the heart. Dogs with phenol painting on the epicardium and dogs in which latex was injected into a diagonal branch showed supersensitive shortening of ERP to infused norepinephrine at apical sites. PVS resulted in ventricular fibrillation more often during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p {$<$} .001) and infusion of norepinephrine (p {$<$} .001) than during the control state in dogs treated with phenol alone.

Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg or 10 mg iv at maximum) attenuated supersensitive shortening of ERP and decreased the incidence of induction of ventricular fibrillation.

In eight dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation shortened ERP at all 45 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. After latex injection, ERP shortening was unchanged at all 15 basal sites but was eliminated (less than or equal to 2 msec shortening) at three apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 14 of 30 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection.

We hypothesized that despite beta-blockade, NPY promotes arrhythmogenesis via ventricular myocyte receptors. Methods In 78 patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or and results fibrillation (VF) occurred in 6 (7.7\\%) within 48 h. These patients had significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) higher venous NPY levels despite the absence of classical risk factors including late presentation, larger infarct size, and beta-blocker usage. Receiver operating curve identified an NPY threshold of 27.3 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.71. RT-qPCR demonstrated the presence of NPY mRNA in both human and rat stellate ganglia. In the isolated Langendorff perfused rat heart, prolonged (10 Hz, 2 min) stimulation of the stellate ganglia caused significant NPY release. Despite maximal beta-blockade with metoprolol (10 lmol/L), optical mapping of ventricular voltage and calcium (using RH237 and Rhod2) demonstrated an increase in magnitude and shortening in duration of the calcium transient and a significant lowering of ventricular fibrillation threshold. These effects were prevented by the Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304 (1 lmol/L). Neuropeptide Y (250 nmol/L) significantly increased the incidence of VT/VF (60\\% vs. 10\\%) during experimental ST-elevation ischaemia and reperfusion compared to control, and this could also be prevented by BIBO3304. Conclusions The co-transmitter NPY is released during sympathetic stimulation and acts as a novel arrhythmic trigger.

Methods: One hundred patients who presented with pure autonomic failure were recruited at 5 medical centers in the United States. Seventy-four patients agreed to be followed prospectively. Patients underwent clinical evaluations including neurological rating scales, sleep questionnaires, smell test, and sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic function tests. Results: At enrollment, patients were 68 ± 12 years old (median ± interquartile range) and had had autonomic failure for 5 ± 7 years. Within 4 years of follow-up, 25 of 74 subjects (34\\%) developed dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 13), Parkinson disease (n = 6), or multiple system atrophy (n = 6). The presence of probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder was strongly associated with the development of a manifest central nervous system (CNS) synucleinopathy (odds ratio = 7.1). Patients who phenoconverted to multiple system atrophy had younger age at onset of autonomic failure, severe bladder/bowel dysfunction, preserved olfaction, and a cardiac chronotropic response upon tilt {$>$} 10 beats per minute. Those who phenoconverted to Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies had decreased olfaction, a lesser chronotropic response to tilt, and a longer duration of illness. The small group of patients retaining the pure autonomic failure phenotype had very low plasma norepinephrine levels, slow resting heart rate, no REM sleep behavior disorder, and preserved smell. Interpretation: Patients presenting with pure autonomic failure are at high risk of phenoconverting to a manifest CNS synucleinopathy. Specific clinical features predict future diagnosis.

This inter-organ crosstalk is critical for normal function of the heart and other organs; derangements within the nervous system hierarchy contribute to pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. The role of intact cardiac nerves in development of, as well as protection against, ischemic injury is of current interest since it may involve recruitment of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. For instance, ischemic conditioning, a novel protection strategy against organ injury, and in particular remote conditioning, is likely mediated by activation of neural pathways or by endogenous cytoprotective blood-borne substances that stimulate different signalling pathways. This discovery reinforces the concept that inter-organ communication, and maintenance thereof, is key. As such, greater understanding of mechanisms and elucidation of treatment strategies is imperative to improve clinical outcomes particularly in patients with comorbidities. For instance, autonomic imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system regulation can initiate cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy that compromises cardiac stability and function. Neuromodulation therapies that directly target the intrinsic cardiac nervous system or other elements of the nervous system hierarchy are currently being investigated for treatment of different maladies in animal and human studies.},\n  keywords = {Autonomic neuropathy,Coronary blood flow regulation,Intrinsic cardiac nervous system,Ischemic conditioning,Myocardial ischemia}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162692,"version":0},"$loki":691},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2063,"entry":"@article{Kluge2021,\n  title = {Rapid Measurement of Cardiac Neuropeptide Dynamics by Capacitive Immunoprobe in the Porcine Heart.},\n  author = {Kluge, Nicholas and Dacey, Michael and Hadaya, Joseph and Shivkumar, Kalyanam and Chan, Shyue-An and Ardell, Jeffrey L and Smith, Corey},\n  date = {2021},\n  journaltitle = {American journal of physiology.

Whereas norepinephrine (NE) is their primary neurotransmitter, neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundant cardiac cotransmitter. NPY plays a vital role in homeostatic processes including angiogenesis, vasoconstriction, and cardiac remodeling. Elevated sympathetic stress, resulting in increased NE and NPY release, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias, which may result in sudden cardiac death. Current methods for the detection of NPY in myocardium are limited in their spatial and temporal resolution and take days to weeks to provide results [e.g., interstitial microdialysis with subsequent analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or mass spectrometry]. In this study, we report a novel approach for measurement of interstitial and intravascular NPY using a minimally invasive capacitive immunoprobe (C.I. probe). The first high-spatial and temporal resolution, multichannel measurements of NPY release in vivo are provided in both myocardium and transcardiac vascular space in a beating porcine heart. We provide NPY responses evoked by sympathetic stimulation and ectopic ventricular pacing and compare these to NE release and hemodynamic responses. We extend this approach to measure both NPY and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and show differential release profiles under sympathetic stimulation. Our data demonstrate rapid and local changes in neurotransmitter profiles in response to sympathetic cardiac stressors. Future implementations include real-time intraoperative determination of cardiac neuropeptides and deployment as a minimally invasive catheter.NEW \\& NOTEWORTHY The sympathetic nervous system regulates cardiac function through release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides within the myocardium. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acts as an acute cardiac vasoconstrictor and chronically to regulate angiogenesis and cardiac remodeling. Current methodologies for the measure of NPY are not capable of providing rapid readouts on a single-sample basis. Here we provide the first in vivo methodology to report dynamic, localized NPY levels within both myocardium and vascular compartments in a beating heart.},\n  keywords = {autonomic nervous system,capacitive immunoprobe,cardiac,neuropeptide Y,sympathetic}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162699,"version":0},"$loki":692},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":885,"entry":"@article{Koene2017,\n  title = {Syncope and the Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death: {{Evaluation}}, Management, and Prevention},\n  author = {Koene, Ryan J. and Adkisson, Wayne O. and Benditt, David G.},\n  date = {2017-12},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Arrhythmia},\n  volume = {33},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {29255498},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {533--544},\n  issn = {18832148},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.joa.2017.07.005},\n  url = {http://doi.wiley.com/10.1016/j.joa.2017.07.005},\n  urldate = {2019-01-28},\n  abstract = {Syncope is a clinical syndrome defined as a relatively brief self-limited transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) caused by a period of inadequate cerebral nutrient flow.

The causes of syncope are diverse, but in most instances, are relatively benign (e.g., reflex and orthostatic faints) with the main risks being accidents and/or injury. However, in some instances, syncope may be due to more worrisome conditions (particularly those associated with cardiac structural disease or channelopathies); in such circumstances, syncope may be an indicator of increased morbidity and mortality risk, including sudden cardiac death (SCD). Establishing an accurate basis for the etiology of syncope is crucial in order to initiate effective therapy.

Recent reports have suggested an association of dog companionship with lower blood pressure levels, improved lipid profile, and diminished sympathetic responses to stress. However, it is unclear if dog ownership is associated with improved survival as previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of dog ownership with all-cause mortality, with and without prior cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS Studies published between 1950 and May 24, 2019 were identified by searching Embase and PubMed. Observational studies that evaluated baseline dog ownership and subsequent all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. We assessed pooled data using random-effects model. A possible limitation was that the analyses were not adjusted for confounders. Ten studies were included yielding data from 3 837 005 participants (530 515 events; mean follow-up 10.1 years). Dog ownership was associated with a 24\\% risk reduction for all-cause mortality as compared to nonownership (relative risk, 0.76; 95\\% CI, 0.67-0.86) with 6 studies demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of death. Notably, in individuals with prior coronary events, living in a home with a dog was associated with an even more pronounced risk reduction for all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.35; 95\\% CI, 0.17-0.69; I2, 0\\%). Moreover, when we restricted the analyses to studies evaluating cardiovascular mortality, dog ownership conferred a 31\\% risk reduction for cardiovascular death (relative risk, 0.69; 95\\% CI, 0.67-0.71; I2, 5.1\\%). CONCLUSIONS Dog ownership is associated with lower risk of death over the long term, which is possibly driven by a reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

The association between sleep disturbances and depression has long been recognised. Disturbed sleep is a diagnostic criterion for MDD, and insomnia commonly precedes the onset of symptomatic mood disorders. Disruptions of the sleep-wake cycle (sleep architecture and timing) are residual symptoms that may prevent the attainment of high-quality remission and delay recovery from MDD. Therefore, early recognition and treatment of sleep disturbances may be important for the treatment and prevention of recurrent depression. Evidence suggests that melatonergic (MT(1) and MT(2)) and the 5-HT(2C) serotonergic receptor subtypes are important modulators of circadian rhythmicity. Agomelatine is the first melatonergic antidepressant; an agonist of melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors, with additional antagonist properties at the 5-HT(2C) receptors. Agomelatine combines antidepressant efficacy including quality and efficiency of sleep, with a more favourable side-effect profile than current antidepressant treatments, including neutral effects on sexual function, bodyweight and the absence of discontinuation symptoms.

However, the mechanism of shock-related proarrhythmia remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of ICD shock on repolarization instability, a factor associated with ventricular arrhythmogenesis. Methods and Results: Sixty-five patients with ICDs underwent ambulatory ECG monitoring during defibrillation testing 3 months postimplant. TWA was analyzed continuously in the time domain during baseline, sedated, and post-shock states. RR, QRS, and QT intervals and catecholamines were also measured continuously. Adequate pre- and post-shock Holter data were recorded in 55 patients, 48 male, mean 64 ± 12 years, 50 with coronary disease, 48 with prior spontaneous or induced arrhythmia. TWA significantly increased after shock, from 9.6 ± 0.5 to 11.9 ± 0.6 μV, as did QRS duration, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels, compared with sedated and baseline states. RR intervals decreased minimally. TWA changes with shock were not associated with RR or QRS duration changes, but were associated with changes in epinephrine. Conclusions: ICD shock, even in the sedated state, increases repolarization instability as measured by TWA, an effect mediated in part by sympathetic stimulation. This association between shock and TWA may have important mechanistic and clinical implications for optimization of defibrillation therapy. © 2007 by Futura Publishing Company, Inc.},\n  keywords = {Defibrillation,Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator,Repolarization,T-wave alternans}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162719,"version":0},"$loki":701},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":716,"entry":"@article{LaRovere1998,\n  title = {Baroreflex Sensitivity and Heart-Rate Variability in Prediction of Total Cardiac Mortality after Myocardial Infarction},\n  author = {La Rovere, Maria Teresa and Bigger, J Thomas and Marcus, Frank I and Mortara, Andrea and Schwartz, Peter J},\n  date = {1998-02-14},\n  journaltitle = {Lancet},\n  volume = {351},\n  number = {9101},\n  eprint = {9482439},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {478--484},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}},\n  issn = {01406736},\n  doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11144-8},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9482439},\n  urldate = {2018-04-24},\n  abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent ({$<$} 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN {$<$} 70 ms) or BRS ({$<$} 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95\\% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17\\% when both were below the cut-offs and 2\\% (p {$<$} 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN {$>$} 105 ms, BRS {$>$} 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35\\% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35\\% and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation.

Biomarkers and novel imaging techniques may provide further risk stratification in the general population beyond traditional risk stratification for coronary artery disease alone. Despite these advances, significant challenges in risk stratification remain that must be overcome before a meaningful impact on SCD can be realized.},\n  isbn = {0009-7330},\n  keywords = {Early repolarisation syndrome,Implantable cardioverter defibrillator,Ischaemic cardiomyopathy,Non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy,Risk stratification,Signal averaged ECG,Sudden cardiac death,Ventricular fibrillation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/DJQT76JV/2015 - Deyell, Krahn, Goldberger - Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Stratification.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162740,"version":0},"$loki":708},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1280,"entry":"@article{Link2008,\n  title = {Diagnostic and Prognostic Imaging of the Cardiac Sympathetic Nervous System},\n  author = {Link, Jeanne M and Caldwell, James H},\n  date = {2008},\n  journaltitle = {Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {17434297},\n  doi = {10.1038/ncpcardio1150},\n  url = {www.nature.com/clinicalpractice/cardio},\n  urldate = {2019-05-23},\n  abstract = {Individuals with systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure may have decreased neuronal density, decreased neuronal function (reuptake or retention of norepinephrine), or a combination of these, plus reduction in postsynaptic -receptor density.

Objective: To investigate the chronic effects after interrupting the ECANS-ICANS connections by ablating the SVC-Ao GP. Methods: A right thoracotomy in 10 dogs allowed stimulation at the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins (RSPV and RIPV, respectively), right atrial appendage (RAA), and SVC to determine effective refractory period (ERP) and atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility in the first operation. Group 1 (n = 5) received SVC-Ao GP ablation; group 2 (n = 5) received no ablation. A second operation and the same measurements were made 10 weeks later. A pacemaker with lead implanted at the RSPV recorded atrial fibrillation or tachycardia (AF/AT). Results: During the first operation in group 1, ERPs increased significantly in the SVC but not at the RSPV, RIPV, or RAA site immediately after ablation, whereas ERPs decreased significantly in the RSPV, RIPV, and RAA but not the SVC in the second operation performed 10 weeks later (compared to the ERP in the first operation). ERPs decreased and AF/AT burden increased significantly from weeks 4 and 5, respectively, after the first operation in group 1 dogs.

DESIGN Prospective cohort of patients with chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the upper extremity requiring therapeutic stellate ganglion blockade. SETTING University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS Fifteen adult ASA physical status I and II patients with the diagnosis of chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the arm were studied. Right stellate ganglion block was performed in nine subjects and a left in six. INTERVENTIONS Stellate ganglion block was performed with 10 mL of 1\\% plain Xylocaine. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed immediately prior and 30 min following the block. MEASUREMENTS Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored at regular intervals. Global systolic function was determined by calculating ejection fraction. Regional systolic motion was evaluated on the short axis and four-chamber views using the American Society of Echocardiography criteria. Diastolic function was assessed with pulsed-wave Doppler of the left ventricular outflow tract and the mitral valve. Data collected included isovolumic relaxation time and early and atrial velocity patterns. MAIN RESULTS A successful stellate ganglion block was achieved in all patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly different during data collection. Patients who underwent a right stellate ganglion block showed no significant differences in systolic or diastolic function. Following a left stellate ganglion block, global and regional systolic function remained unchanged. Isovolumic relaxation time was increased but did not reach statistical significance (80 +/- 13 ms to 88 +/- 9 ms; p = 0.09). Left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic volumes (LVESV) were significantly increased (LVEDV from 73 +/- 9 mL to 100 +/- 9 mL, p {$<$} 0.02; LVESV from 31 +/- 4 mL to 37 +/- 4 mL, p {$<$} 0.03).

In the animal with acute myocardial ischemia such stimuli suffice to provoke ventricular fibrillation. Vagal neural traffic or adrenal catecholamines are not the conduits for this brain-heart linkage. Accompanying increases in heart rate or blood pressure are not prerequisites for the changes in cardiac excitability. Increased sympathetic activity, whether induced by neural or neurohumoral action, predisposes the heart to ventricular fibrillation. Protection can be achieved with surgical and pharmacologic denervation or reflex reduction in sympathetic tone. With acute myocardial ischemia, augmented sympathetic activity accounts for the early surge of ectopic activity frequently precipitating ventricular fibrillation. Asymmetries in sympathetic neural discharge may also contribute to the genesis of serious arrhythmias. The vagus nerve, through its muscarinic action, exerts an indirect effect on cardiac vulnerability, the consequence of annulment of concomitant adrenergic influence, rather than of any direct cholinergic action on the ventricles. There exist anatomic, physiologic as well as molecular bases for such interactions. Available experimental evidence indicates that environmental stresses of diverse types can injure the heart, lower the threshold of cardiac vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation and, in the animal with coronary occlusion, provoke potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Available evidence indicates that in man, as in the experimental animal, administration of catecholamines can induce ventricular arrhythmia, whereas vagal activity exerts an opposite effect.

It was recognized at the dawn of recorded history and even depicted in Egyptian relief sculpture from the tomb of a noble of the Sixth dynasty approximately 4,500 years ago. Sudden cardiac death has left no age untouched. Sparing neither saint nor sinner, it has burdened man with a sense of uncertainty and fragility. The enormity of this problem demands attention. In the United States, sudden cardiac death claims about 1,200 lives daily, or approximately one victim every minute. It is the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 64 years, accounting for 32 percent of the fatalities in this group. Nearly 25 percent of persons dying suddenly have had no prior recognized symptoms of heart disease.The excess of widows observed in retirement communities is accounted for by the three- to fourfold greater incidence of sudden cardiac death among men. Sudden death in old age might be a blessing rather than a scourge, but instead it frequently explodes a man's life at its prime, at a median age of only 59 years. The medical profession has sensed the issue but has largely ignored sudden death as a problem amenable to solution. This indifference has not been the result of a lack of interest or concern but a reflection of the belief that sudden cardiac death was the inevitable culmination of coronary atherosclerosis. Because sudden death was unpredictable and afflicted the apparently healthy subject outside the hospital, the physician considered it an act of fate before which he was largely helpless. The advent of the coronary care unit has promoted a reassessment of this complex problem. It has become clear that sudden death is not the inexorable culmination of advanced coronary atherosclerosis but instead is the result of ventricular fibrillation and therefore is readily reversible.7,8If ventricular fibrillation were only the consequence of severe coronary atherosclerosis, once reversed it would promptly recur. However, patients treated for ventricular fibrillation seldom have recurring episodes, and they usually recover and survive for long periods.9,10The new concept that ventricular fibrillation is an electrical accident suggests that its cause is not anatomic and thereby contributes to the growing interest in redefining the basis for sudden death and developing methods for its containment. Until recently our inability to deal with sudden cardiac death has not been due to a gap in the application of knowledge but to a gap in knowledge itself. The purpose of this review is to indicate how much we know and to sketch the path of possible further progress. © 1979.},\n  isbn = {0002-9149},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3VUN9HD3/1979 - Lown - Sudden cardiac death The major challenge confronting contemporary cardiology.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162763,"version":0},"$loki":715},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":912,"entry":"@article{Lown1979a,\n  title = {Sudden Cardiac Death -- 1978.},\n  author = {Lown, Bernard},\n  date = {1979-12},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {60},\n  number = {7},\n  pages = {1593--1599},\n  issn = {0009-7322},\n  doi = {10.1161/01.CIR.60.7.1593},\n  url = {http://circ.ahajournals.org/},\n  urldate = {2019-02-09},\n  abstract = {With the development of coronary care units in the 1960s, attitudes toward sudden cardiac death (SCD) began to change as physicians learned that cardiac arrest was reversible. The problem of SCD has two aspects an acute, precipitating factor and a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. Resolution of the problem requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Ven-tricular premature complexes (VPCs) have been related to the development of serious arrhythmias and early death, but the mere presence of VPCs does not discriminate risk of subsequent fatality. VPCs should be graded according to frequency, persistence, multiformity, repetitive pattern and degree of prematurity. Provocation of repetitive extrasystoles by R-on-T pacing may indicate the presence of a reduced threshold for ventricular fibrillation (VF). Prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy may help protect patients resuscitated from VF against recurrent cardiac arrest. Neuropharmacologic factors perhaps affecting central nervous system sympathetic activity can alter cardiac vulnerability and may protect against VF. Findings in dogs indicate that psychologic stress can reduce the cardiac threshold for VF. If psychologic factors predispose to ventricular arrhythmias by increasing the level of sympathetic tone, lessening neural sympathetic activity should reduce the incidence of SCD. SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH (SCD) is one of the major challenges to contemporary cardiology. Its sheer magnitude demands attention, claiming over 400 thousand lives annually, or about 60\\% of all coronary heart disease fatalities. The problem of sudden death has been recognized since the beginning of recorded history, yet before the 1960s, SCD received scant attention from clinical and research communities. In part this related to the prevailing perception that SCD was the ultimate expression of severe, far-advanced and irreversible coronary athero-sclerosis. Since the SCD was unexpected and struck down the seemingly healthy subject outside the hospital , the physician deemed it an act of fate before which he or she was largely helpless. As is often true in science, new methodologies not only usher in new content, but also mold new attitudes. In the case of SCD it was the burgeoning coronary care units (CCU) of the 1960s that stimulated a new direction. CCU experience largely dispelled the sense of futility, for it became rapidly evident that cardiac arrest was reversible. Patients promptly resuscitated from primary electrical failure consistently recovered and survived for variable and prolonged periods determined by the extent of their underlying heart disease. Because ventricular fibrilla-tion (VF) had its highest incidence at the beginning of a myocardial ischemic episode, it was logical to assume that this same mechanism accounted for out-of-hospital sudden death. The CCU demonstrated that VF can be reversed as well as prevented. These findings have led to the development of two distinct strategies:' 1) to reach the patient promptly and initiate effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation,2 and 2) to identify the patient at increased risk for SCD and institute a prophylactic program against potentially fatal ven-tricular arrhythmias.3 Community Response to Cardiac Arrest The logic of a well-organized community program permitting immediate response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not debatable. The critical factor is the expeditious reaching of the victim by personnel fully tutored in basic life support. This necessarily requires that large sectors of the population be trained and their skill in cardiopulmonary resuscitation be finely honed at all times for the unexpected emergency. In Seattle, where such a program has been in operation for over 6 years, there have been 346 long-term survivors out of 1710 episodes of VF encountered in the community.4 The percentage of immediate resuscitations has improved annually, as has the yield in long-term survivors. A disquieting aspect of the Seat-tle experience is the high incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest. The mortality rate has been 26\\% at 1 year and 36\\% at two years. The problem of SCD has two aspects-an acute, precipitating trigger as well as a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. The mere reversal of the cardiac arrest does not obviate the underlying electrophysiologic abnormality. For those successfully resuscitated there can be no assurance that the good fortune of a prompt response by a trained medical team will be repeated. Resolution of the problem of SCD ultimately requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Detecting the Patient at Risk The essential strategy currently followed in identifying the patient at risk and in preventing VF relies on the hypothesis that the ventricular premature complex (VPC) constitutes a risk factor.1 3Two questions, therefore, must be answered: 1) What is the evidence that VPCs indeed indicate predisposition to sudden death? 2) Is there any basis for concluding that control of VPCs will protect against VF? 1593 by guest on May 12, 2016 http://circ.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/D5W57SJ6/1979 - Lown - Sudden cardiac death -- 1978.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162770,"version":0},"$loki":716},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1273,"entry":"@article{Lu2009a,\n  title = {Autonomic Mechanism for Initiation of Rapid Firing from Atria and Pulmonary Veins: {{Evidence}} by Ablation of Ganglionated Plexi},\n  author = {Lu, Zhibing and Scherlag, Benjamin J. and Lin, Jiaxiong and Yu, Lilei and Guo, Ji Hong and Niu, Guodong and Jackman, Warren M. and Lazzara, Ralph and Jiang, Hong and Po, Sunny S.},\n  date = {2009-11-01},\n  journaltitle = {Cardiovascular Research},\n  volume = {84},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {245--252},\n  publisher = {{Narnia}},\n  issn = {00086363},\n  doi = {10.1093/cvr/cvp194},\n  url = {https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cvr/cvp194},\n  urldate = {2019-05-16},\n  abstract = {Aims Previous studies showed that autonomic activation by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) during myocardial refractoriness evokes rapid firing from pulmonary vein (PV) and atria, both in vitro and in vivo. This study sought to investigate the autonomic mechanism underlying the rapid firings at various sites by systematic ablation of multiple ganglionated plexi (GP).Methods and resultsIn 43 mongrel dogs, rapid firing-mediated atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by local HFS (200 Hz, impulse duration 0.1 ms, train duration 40 ms) to the PVs and atria during myocardial refractoriness. The main GP in the atrial fat pads or the ganglia along the ligament of Marshall (LOM) were then ablated. Ablation of the anterior right GP and inferior right GP significantly increased the AF threshold by HFS at the right atrium and PVs. The AF threshold at left atrium and PVs was significantly increased by ablation of the superior left GP and inferior left GP, and was further increased by ablation of the LOM. Ablation of left-or right-sided GP on the atria had a significant effect on contralateral PVs and atrium. Administration of esmolol (1 mg/kg) or atropine (1 mg) significantly increased AF threshold at all sites.ConclusionHFS applied to local atrial and PV sites initiated rapid firing via activation of the interactive autonomic network in the heart. GP in either left side or right side contributes to the rapid firings and AF originating from ipsolateral and contralateral PVs and atrium. Autonomic denervation suppresses or eliminates those rapid firings.},\n  keywords = {Atrial fibrillation,Autonomic nervous system,Ganglionated plexus},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WCZNS7DU/cvp194.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162775,"version":0},"$loki":717},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1582,"entry":"@article{Madden2018,\n  title = {Morning Surge in Blood Pressure Using a Random-Effects Multiple-Component Cosinor Model},\n  author = {Madden, J.M. and Browne, L.D. and Li, X. and Kearney, P.M. and Fitzgerald, A.P.},\n  date = {2018-05-10},\n  journaltitle = {Statistics in Medicine},\n  volume = {37},\n  number = {10},\n  pages = {1682--1695},\n  publisher = {{Irish Health Research Board}},\n  issn = {02776715},\n  doi = {10.1002/sim.7607},\n  url = {http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/sim.7607},\n  urldate = {2020-06-05},\n  abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) fluctuates throughout the day. The pattern it follows represents one of the most important circadian rhythms in the human body. For example, morning BP surge has been suggested as a potential risk factor for cardio-vascular events occurring in the morning, but the accurate quantification of this phenomenon remains a challenge. Here, we outline a novel method to quantify morning surge. We demonstrate how the most commonly used method to model 24-hour BP, the single cosinor approach, can be extended to a multiple-component cosinor random-effects model. We outline how this model can be used to obtain a measure of morning BP surge by obtaining derivatives of the model fit. The model is compared with a functional principal component analysis that determines the main components of variability in the data. Data from the Mitchelstown Study, a population-based study of Irish adults (n = 2047), were used where a subsample (1207) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We demonstrate that our 2-component model provided a significant improvement in fit compared with a single model and a similar fit to a more complex model captured by b-splines using functional principal component analysis. The estimate of the average maximum slope was 2.857 mmHg/30 min (bootstrap estimates; 95\\% CI: 2.855-2.858 mmHg/30 min).

In particular examining the nature of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), its characteristics, the frequencies of these rhythms and possible mechanisms responsible for their generation. Sympathetic activity can be thought of as a complex output of the central nervous system providing subtle control over end organ function. This control is exerted in a number of frequency bands including rhythms related to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, 10 Hz, and between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz. The generation and control over the occurrence of each of these rhythms is likely to be quite separate. Although aerent feedback from sources such as baroreceptors can explain some of the rhythmical properties in each case there is good evidence for inherent generation of aspects of these rhythms. A variety of brainstem cell groups are thought to be involved in their generation with the rostral ventrolateral medulla, although unlikely to be solely responsible for tone generation, an important regulator of overall activity. SNA also varies in the number of nerves recruited to ®re in each synchronized discharge. Little is known about this control other than it appears to be quite separate from the control over the timing of discharges. Spinal cord mechanisms are possibly involved. SNA frequencies above 0.7 Hz do not appear to directly induce oscillations in innervated vasculature, however, are likely to contribute to setting the level of vasoconstrictive tone. Slower frequencies appear to directly cause oscillations in blood ¯ow. \\#},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WN29IUTJ/m-api-69214dd5-2590-d8d3-1d5e-6cc26096ddd1.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162807,"version":0},"$loki":723},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1357,"entry":"@article{Malpas2010a,\n  title = {Sympathetic Nervous System Overactivity and Its Role in the Development of Cardiovascular Disease},\n  author = {Malpas, Simon C},\n  date = {2010},\n  journaltitle = {Physiological Reviews},\n  volume = {90},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {513--557},\n  issn = {00319333},\n  doi = {10.1152/physrev.00007.2009},\n  url = {www.prv.org},\n  urldate = {2020-01-30},\n  abstract = {This review examines how the sympathetic nervous system plays a major role in the regulation of cardiovascular function over multiple time scales. This is achieved through differential regulation of sympathetic outflow to a variety of organs. This differential control is a product of the topographical organization of the central nervous system and a myriad of afferent inputs. Together this organization produces sympathetic responses tailored to match stimuli. The long-term control of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) is an area of considerable interest and involves a variety of mediators acting in a quite distinct fashion. These mediators include arterial baroreflexes, angiotensin II, blood volume and osmolarity, and a host of humoral factors. A key feature of many cardiovascular diseases is increased SNA. However, rather than there being a generalized increase in SNA, it is organ specific, in particular to the heart and kidneys. These increases in regional SNA are associated with increased mortality. Understanding the regulation of organ-specific SNA is likely to offer new targets for drug therapy. There is a need for the research community to develop better animal models and technologies that reflect the disease progression seen in humans. A particular focus is required on models in which SNA is chronically elevated.

It has been hypothesized that behavioral influences on coronary heart disease are mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, perhaps through exacerbation of coronary artery atherosclerosis. This article summarizes several studies of the effects of stress and sympathetic arousal on atherosclerosis in a nonhuman primate model of atherogenesis. The application of a behavioral stressor involving periodic reorganization of social group memberships resulted in worsened coronary atherosclerosis among male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a cholesterol-containing diet, relative to control animals housed in groups of fixed (stable) membership, but only among those monkeys that retained dominant social status during the course of the study. This effect could not be attributed to concomitant variability in blood pressure or serum lipid concentrations. When the same experimental procedures were applied to males fed a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, the manipulation of group memberships similarly led to development of greater atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In related observations, monkeys that exhibited the largest heart rate responses to a standardized behavioral challenge had more extensive coronary atherosclerosis than animals showing a less pronounced cardiac responsivity to stress. In a final investigation, we observed that the exacerbated atherosclerosis of dominant monkeys consuming an atherogenic diet and housed in unstable social groups could be prevented by long-term administration of a β-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent, propranolol hydrochloride. © 1988.},\n  issue = {1 PART 2},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/2MRJRP5T/1988_Manuck et al._Effects of stress and the sympathetic nervous system on coronary artery atherosclerosis in the cynomolgus macaque.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162816,"version":0},"$loki":725},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1973,"entry":"@article{Marban1986,\n  title = {Mechanisms of Arrhythmogenic Delayed and Early Afterdepolarizations in Ferret Ventricular Muscle},\n  author = {Marban, Eduardo and Robinson, Shawn W and Wier, W G},\n  date = {1986},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Clinical Investigation},\n  volume = {78},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {3771791},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1185--1192},\n  issn = {00219738},\n  doi = {10.1172/JCI112701},\n  abstract = {Drug-induced triggered arrhythmias in heart muscle involve oscillations of membrane potential known as delayed or early afterdepolarizations (DADs or EADs).

Ryanodine (10-9-10-6 M), an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, rapidly suppressed DADs and triggered arrhythmias. When cytoplasmic Ca2+-buffering capacity was enhanced by loading cells with the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA or quin2, DADs were similarly inhibited, as were contractile force and aequorin luminescence. In contrast to DADs, EADs induced by Cs were not suppressed by ryanodine or by loading with intracellular Ca2+ chelators. The possibility that transsarcolemmal Ca2+ entry might produce EADs was evaluated with highly specific dihydropyridine Ca channel agonists and antagonists. Bay K8644 (100-300 nM) potentiated EADs, whereas nitrendipine (3-20 μM) abolished EADs.

The repetitive extrasystole threshold wasemployed as a measure of susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. Instrumental aversive conditioning constituted a stressful environment. The repetitive extrasystole threshold decreased by nearly 50 percent during 3 days in which the animals were exposed to the stressful environment. When Tolamolol hydrochloride, a cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, was administered before a stress session, the repetitive extra-systole threshold was unaltered from the control value. Thus, stress-evoked changes in cardiac vulnerabilityare mediated through the sympathetic nervous system. The role of psychologic stress in predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized clinically. However, precise data documenting this relation have been difficult to obtain in man or in the animal laboratory. With growing interest in the problem of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation, attention has been devoted to alterations in ventricular vulnerability during various stressful states. Recently it has been demonstrated in dogs that the threshold of the ventricular vulnerable period for eliciting repetitive extrasystoles is significantly lower in an aversive than in a placid environment. 1 It has also been found that animals placed in stressful restraint after myocardial infarction experience ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. 2 In pigs protected against psychologic stress, the onset of ventricular fibrillation after coronary arterial ligation is either retarded or entirely prevented, u Moreover, pharmacologically restrained pigs subjected to electrical stimulation undergo severe acute cardiomyopathy and 13 percent die suddenly. 4 This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of psychologic stress upon ventricular electrical stability in the conscious dog. The assumption entertained was that a change in cardiac electrical stability was associated with increased susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. 5 The underlying hypothesis was that a psychologically stressful environment would increase cardiac electrical instability. Instrumental aversive conditioning was the experimental paradigm employed to produce psychologic stress. 6-s Since certain types of stressors in man affect cardiac function through sympathetic nervous mediation, 9 these studies were performed with and without blockade of beta adrenergic activity. Cardiac electrical stability was determined by measuring the threshold current necessary to provoke repetitive ventricular extrasystoles. It has been demonstrated that the repetitive extrasystole threshold can be used as a precise measure of the vulnerable period threshold for ventricular fibrillation.I, lo Methods Ten mongrel dogs, weighing 8.5 to 17 kg, were anesthetized with intravenously administered sodium pentobarbital, 32.5 mg/kg body weight.

Dogs were anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, artificially ventilated and the chests opened wide. A perfusion circuit allowed independent control of pressures distending the three baroreceptor regions. A cardiopulmonary bypass and ventricular fibrillation prevented cardiac pulsations from influencing coronary baroreceptor pressure. The caudal region of the animal was perfused at constant flow and vascular resistance responses were assessed from changes in perfusion pressure. Only tests in which the overall response exceeded 3 kPa (22.5 mmHg) were analyzed. Reflex responses were obtained to significantly lower coronary pressures than were required to induce responses from other regions. The inflexion points of the stimulus-response curves for pulsatile coronary, carotid and aortic pressures were 10.5 +/- 0.6, 15.5 +/- 1.8 and 16.4 +/- 1.7 kPa (79 +/- 5, 116 +/- 14 and 123 +/- 13 mmHg, respectively; values are means +/- S.E.M.). When the responses to pulsatile stimuli were compared with those to non-pulsatile stimuli, it was noted that for the carotid receptors, lower pressures were required to induce responses (inflexion pressure less) and the slope of the stimulus-response curve was less. Pulsatile aortic pressures induced a parallel (downward) displacement of the curve but no change in inflexion point or slope. The coronary baroreceptor stimulus-response relationship was unaffected by pulsatility. These results show differences between the characteristics of the three baroreceptors with coronary receptors being unaffected by pressure pulsatility but likely to be of importance in hypotensive situations.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162839,"version":0},"$loki":731},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2132,"entry":"@article{Mehra2022,\n  title = {Research {{Opportunities}} in {{Autonomic Neural Mechanisms}} of {{Cardiopulmonary Regulation}}: {{A Report From}} the {{National Heart}}, {{Lung}}, and {{Blood Institute}} and the {{National Institutes}} of {{Health Office}} of the {{Director Workshop}}},\n  author = {Mehra, Reena and Tjurmina, Olga A. and Ajijola, Olujimi A. and Arora, Rishi and Bolser, Donald C. and Chapleau, Mark W. and Chen, Peng Sheng and Clancy, Colleen E. and Delisle, Brian P. and Gold, Michael R. and Goldberger, Jeffrey J. and Goldstein, David S. and Habecker, Beth A. and Handoko, M.

The objective of the study was to record the electrocardiogram (ECG) of a large whale to obtain crucial data for comparative electrophysiologic analysis. Background. The data were needed to establish the mismatch between heart size and PR interval and QRS duration in mammals. Methods. In the waters off the coast of Newfoundland, in two humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) with an estimated weight of 30,000 kg a 1-lead ECG was recorded, enabling reliable assessment of P waves and QRS complexes. Results. It was found that both the PR interval (atrioventricular [AV] transmission time) and QRS duration (ventricular excitation) are extremely short for animals of this size. These findings are difficult, if not impossible, to explain on the basis of currently accepted electrophysiologic theories. However, the narrow QRS complex may be due to a very dense His-Purkinje network in the ventricular wall of whales. Alternative mechanisms that can explain the function of the mammalian AV node need to be considered and explored. Conclusions.

Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5\\%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15\\%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6\\% and 8 +/- 7\\%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88\\% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5\\% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3\\% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs.

Stimulation of LV receptors with vagal afferents results in reflex sympathoinhibitory responses. Vagal afferents are known to be preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior (IP) wall of the LV. We tested the hypothesis that there is also a preferential distribution of LV sympathetic afferents. METHODS AND RESULTS We measured reflex responses to stimulation of sympathetic afferents located in the anterior and IP LV: We used myocardial ischemia and chemical stimuli to increase the activity of the sensory endings in 15 chloralose-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs with sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy. Reflex responses were assessed by direct recordings of efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). In nine dogs, maximal RSNA changes elicited by transmural anterior myocardial ischemia (22.6 +/- 3.9\\% increase from baseline nerve traffic) were not significantly different from maximal RSNA changes observed during transmural IP ischemia (27.1 +/- 4.4\\%). Similar changes in mean arterial and left atrial pressures were noted during transmural anterior and IP ischemia. In eight dogs, maximal changes of RSNA elicited by epicardial or intracoronary bradykinin to the anterior LV were not significantly different from those observed during bradykinin to the IP LV (anterior epicardial bradykinin, 76.7 +/- 11.7\\%; IP epicardial bradykinin, 72.2 +/- 10.0\\%; anterior intracoronary bradykinin, 84.6 +/- 21.0\\%; IP intracoronary bradykinin, 88.8 +/- 17.3\\%).

The inferioposterior region shows typically less sympathetic innervation than the anterior region.

Arrhythmogeneity has been related to the heterogeneous innervation of the heart and heterogeneous uptake of radiolabeled catecholamine analogues, such as I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine, can be found in patients with arrhythmia. In dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced uptake indicates a poor prognosis which allows risk stratification for patients with heart failure.

Little is known about the regional release of neuropeptide Y in humans under normal conditions or in pathophysiological situations of sympathetic activation or denervation. We measured plasma neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity and norepinephrine concentrations in samples taken from the brachial artery; coronary sinus; and internal jugular, antecubital, or hepatic veins in volunteers aged 20 to 64 years. Regional neuropeptide Y overflow at rest was calculated from venoarterial plasma concentration differences and plasma flow, and norepinephrine spillover was determined by [() H]norepinephrine infusion techniques. Cardiac release of neuropeptide Y and norepinephrine was examined in response to various stressors as well as in clinical models of sympathetic activation, cardiac failure, and denervation after cardiac transplantation. In healthy volunteers, cardiac, forearm, and jugular venous sample neuropeptide Y concentrations were similar to arterial levels. Hepatic vein plasma neuropeptide Y was greater than arterial both at rest (119 +/- 5\\% of arterial, n = 7) and after a meal (132 +/- 12\\%, n = 7), with neuropeptide Y overflows of 6 +/- 2 and 11 +/- 2 pmol/min, respectively. In contrast, hepatomesenteric norepinephrine spillover was not significantly increased by feeding. Although coronary sinus plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased significantly with the cardiac sympathetic activation accompanying mental arithmetic, coffee drinking, isotonic exercise, and bicycle exercise, only the latter powerful sympathetic stimulus increased neuropeptide Y overflow. Cardiac failure was associated with increased resting release of both norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y from the heart, whereas postcardiac transplant norepinephrine spillover from the heart was reduced. The net overflow of neuropeptide Y to plasma observed at rest across the hepatic circulation, but not the cardiac, forearm, or cerebral circulations, indicates that the gut, the liver, or both make a major contribution to systemic plasma neuropeptide Y levels in humans.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the current incidence of SCD and its trend over the past 2 decades in a general middle-aged and elderly population. METHODS: This study was performed within the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of persons aged 45 years and older. Age-standardized incidence rates of SCD were calculated. To study trends in incidence, we compared 2 subcohorts within the total study population, 1 followed from 1990-2000 and the other from 2001-2010. RESULTS: From 1990-2010, 5512 of 14,628 participants died, of whom 583 (4.0\\%) were classified as SCD. The overall incidence was 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence was higher in men (5.2 per 1000 person-years) than in women (3.6 per 1000 person-years). Age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95\\% confidence [CI] 1.56-2.17) and risk of SCD increased with age (HR 1.10 per year; 95\\% CI 1.09 -1.11). The incidence rate from 1990-2000 was 4.7 per 1000 person-years vs 2.1 per 1000 person-years from 2001-2010 (age- and sex-adjusted HR of SCD 0.60, 95\\% CI 0.44-0.80). To check for cohort effects, we also analyzed the incidence of total mortality and found an age- and sex-adjusted HR of total mortality of 0.82 (95\\% CI 0.75-0.90) for the second compared to the first subcohort, which was significantly higher than the decline in SCD incidence. CONCLUSION: We found an incidence of SCD of 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence decreased from 1990-2010, a period during which the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease greatly improved.},\n  keywords = {Cardiovascular disease,Epidemiology,Incidence,Mortality,Population-based study,Sudden cardiac death,Time trends}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162895,"version":0},"$loki":749},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1142,"entry":"@article{Nozdrachev2002a,\n  title = {John {{Newport Langley}} and His Construction of the Autonomic ({{Vegetative}}) Nervous System},\n  author = {Nozdrachev, A.

VF intervals were used as an index of local refractoriness, based on the assumption that during ventricular fibrillation, cells are reexcited as soon as they have recovered their excitability. In support of this, microelectrode recordings in two hearts during ventricular fibrillation did not show a diastolic interval between successive action potentials. Refractory periods determined at a basic cycle length of 300 msec with the extrastimulus method correlated well with VF intervals measured at the same sites. Thus, this technique allows assessment of spatial dispersion of refractoriness during brief interventions such as sympathetic stimulation. The responses to left, right, and combined stellate ganglion stimulation varied substantially among individual hearts. This was observed both in dogs with an intact (n = 12) and decentralized (n = 6) autonomic nervous system. Individual ventricular sites could show effects of both left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (42\\% of tested sites) or show effects of left-sided stimulation only (31\\%) or right-sided stimulation only (14\\%). In 13\\% of sites, no effects of stellate stimulation were observed. Apart from these regional effects, the responses could be qualitatively different; that is, within the same heart, the VF interval prolonged at one site but shortened at another in response to the same intervention, although shortening was the general effect and prolongation the exception. Whenever sites responded to stellate ganglion stimulation with a shortening of VF interval, this shortening was approximately 10\\% for left, right, or combined stimulation, whether the autonomic nervous system was intact or decentralized. In six of 12 hearts in the intact group, there was a distinct regional effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation; in the other six hearts, the effects were distributed homogeneously over the ventricles. In three hearts, the effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation was strongest in the posterior wall, and in the other three hearts, in the anterior wall. The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation were restricted to the anterior or lateral part of the left ventricle. Dispersion of VF intervals increased after left and combined stellate ganglion stimulation in the intact group and after right stellate ganglion stimulation in the decentralized group, but not significantly in every heart. This points to a marked individual variation with regard to the effects of sympathetic stimulation on electrophysiological properties of the heart.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162912,"version":0},"$loki":753},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1989,"entry":"@article{OShea2022,\n  title = {High Resolution Optical Mapping of Cardiac Electrophysiology in Pre-Clinical Models},\n  author = {O’Shea, Christopher and Winter, James and Kabir, S.

During aortic stretch, the sensitivity of the baroreflex was reduced 57 +/- 7\\% from 18 +/- 2 msec/mm Hg (P less than 0.01). The pressor response was increased by 49 +/- 8\\% after bilateral carotid sinus nerve section and vagotomy. These excitatory reflex responses were obtained in absence of any pain reaction. Thus, in the conscious dog, aortic distension within physiological ranges induces a potent pressor sympathetic reflex with positive feedback characteristics. Such a pressor reflex not only occurs in the presence of functioning baroreflexes, but is also capable of reducing their sensitivity.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162929,"version":0},"$loki":756},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1874,"entry":"@article{Parcha2021,\n  title = {Chronobiology of {{Natriuretic Peptides}} and {{Blood Pressure}} in {{Lean}} and {{Obese Individuals}}},\n  author = {Parcha, Vibhu and Patel, Nirav and Gutierrez, Orlando M. and Li, Peng and Gamble, Karen L. and Musunuru, Kiran and Margulies, Kenneth B. and Cappola, Thomas P. and Wang, Thomas J. and Arora, Garima and Arora, Pankaj},\n  date = {2021-05-11},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {77},\n  number = {18},\n  eprint = {33958126},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {2291--2303},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier Inc.}},\n  issn = {15583597},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2021.03.291},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2021.03.291},\n  urldate = {2022-03-04},\n  abstract = {Background: Diurnal variation of natriuretic peptide (NP) levels and its relationship with 24-h blood pressure (BP) rhythm has not been established. Obese individuals have a relative NP deficiency and disturbed BP rhythmicity. Objectives: This clinical trial evaluated the diurnal rhythmicity of NPs (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP], mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide [MR-proANP], N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) and the relationship of NP rhythm with 24-h BP rhythm in healthy lean and obese individuals. Methods: On the background of a standardized diet, healthy, normotensive, lean (body mass index 18.5 to 25 kg/m2) and obese (body mass index 30 to 45 kg/m2) individuals, age 18 to 40 years, underwent 24-h inpatient protocol involving ambulatory BP monitoring starting 24 h prior to the visit, controlled light intensity, and repeated blood draws for assessment of analytes. Cosinor analysis of normalized NP levels (normalized to 24-h mean value) was conducted to assess the diurnal NP rhythm and its relationship with systolic BP. Results: Among 52 participants screened, 40 participants (18 lean, 22 obese; 50\\% women; 65\\% Black) completed the study. The median range spread (percentage difference between the minimum and maximum values) over 24 h for MR-proANP, BNP, and NT-proBNP levels was 72.0\\% (interquartile range [IQR]: 50.9\\% to 119.6\\%), 75.5\\% (IQR: 50.7\\% to 106.8\\%), and 135.0\\% (IQR: 66.3\\% to 270.4\\%), respectively. A cosine wave-shaped 24-h oscillation of normalized NP levels (BNP, MR-proANP, and NT-proBNP) was noted both in lean and obese individuals (prhythmicity {$<$}0.05 for all). A larger phase difference between MR-proANP BP rhythm (−4.9 h vs. −0.7 h) and BNP BP rhythm (−3.3 h vs. −0.9 h) was seen in obese compared with lean individuals. Conclusions: This human physiological trial elucidates evidence of diurnal NP rhythmicity and the presence of an NP-BP rhythm axis. There exists a misalignment of the NP-BP diurnal rhythm in the obese, which may contribute to the disturbed diurnal BP pattern observed among obese individuals.

The retrograde tracer, Diamidino Yellow, was injected into the right or left ventricles to label somata in the sympathetic chain. Analysis of all sympathetic ganglia from superior cervical ganglion through the 10th thoracic ganglion indicated that the postganglionic innervation of the rat cardiac ventricles originates bilaterally. The majority of these somata were located in the middle and inferior cervical ganglia (middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex) (approximately 92\\% of all labelled cells), with lesser contributions from the superior cervical and 4th through 6th thoracic ganglia. To confirm and further quantitate these findings, the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex was removed (MC-S ganglionectomy) bilaterally or ipsilaterally from the left or right sides, and regional cardiac norepinephrine concentration (left and right atrial appendages and left and right ventricles) was analysed 7 or 28 days later. At both times after bilateral MC-S ganglionectomy, regional cardiac norepinephrine was reduced by 89\\% to 100\\%, indicating the removal of almost all cardiac noradrenergic cells of origin and possibly fibers of passage. The results of unilateral MC-S ganglionectomy experiments indicated that the atrial appendages and the left ventricle receive bilateral innervation from the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex. However, the left middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex appears to contribute a majority of the norepinephrine to the right ventricle. Furthermore, between 7 and 28 days after contralateral MC-S ganglionectomy, atrial appendages, but not ventricles, display significant recovery of norepinephrine content. The present data demonstrate: (1) a bilateral locus of origin of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic neurons, limited longitudinally to cervical through mid-thoracic ganglia, and (2) the ability of the cardiac postganglionic innervation to regenerate after partial denervation. These results demonstrate anatomical evidence for significant bilateral integration of cardiac sympathetic activity at the level of the sympathetic ganglion in the rat. © 1989.},\n  keywords = {Cardiac innervation,Middle cervical ganglion,Norepinephrine,Postganglionic fiber,Retrograde tracer,Stellate ganglion,Sympathetic nerve}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162938,"version":0},"$loki":758},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1680,"entry":"@article{Park2013,\n  title = {Neural Mechanisms of Atrial Fibrillation},\n  author = {Park, Hyung-wook and Shen, Mark J and Lin, Shien-fong and Fishbein, Michael C and Chen, Lan S. and Chen, Peng-sheng},\n  date = {2012-01},\n  journaltitle = {Current Opinion in Cardiology},\n  volume = {27},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {24--28},\n  issn = {0268-4705},\n  doi = {10.1097/HCO.0b013e32834dc4e8},\n  url = {http://journals.lww.com/00001573-201201000-00006},\n  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The autonomic nerve system is a potentially potent modulator of the initiation and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation.

Objective: To determine whether ALAN exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. Exposures: Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [WC] ≥88 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] ≥0.85, or waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]≥0.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported BMI at enrollment was compared with self-reported BMI at follow-up (mean [SD] follow-up, 5.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95\\% CIs for prevalent and incident obesity. Results: Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using BMI (PR, 1.03; 95\\% CI, 1.02-1.03), WC (PR, 1.12; 95\\% CI, 1.09-1.16), WHR (PR, 1.04; 95\\% CI, 1.00-1.08), and WHtR (PR, 1.07; 95\\% CI, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P {$<$}.001 for trend for each measure. Having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity (RR, 1.19; 95\\% CI, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no ALAN, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more (RR, 1.17; 95\\% CI, 1.08-1.27; P {$<$}.001 for trend), a BMI increase of 10\\% or more (RR, 1.13; 95\\% CI, 1.02-1.26; P =.04 for trend), incident overweight (RR, 1.22; 95\\% CI,1.06-1.40; P =.03 for trend), and incident obesity (RR, 1.33; 95\\% CI, 1.13-1.57; P {$<$}.001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that exposure to ALAN while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to ALAN while sleeping can promote obesity prevention.},\n  keywords = {lighting,night time,obesity,sleep,weight gain},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/FHHZ7N4I/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162951,"version":0},"$loki":760},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1216,"entry":"@article{Parsons2006,\n  title = {Presence and Co-Localization of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide with Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase in Cells and Nerve Fibers within Guinea Pig Intrinsic Cardiac Ganglia and Cardiac Tissue},\n  author = {Parsons, Rodney L. and Locknar, Sarah A. and Young, Beth A. and Hoard, Jennifer L. and Hoover, Donald B.},\n  date = {2006-02-12},\n  journaltitle = {Cell and Tissue Research},\n  volume = {323},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {197--209},\n  issn = {0302-766X},\n  doi = {10.1007/s00441-005-0074-3},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00441-005-0074-3},\n  urldate = {2019-05-15},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of obesity has focused on childhood as a target period. Our aim was to assess whether frequency of adolescent physical activity affected subsequent body mass index (BMI) gain through to mid-adulthood. METHODS: The British birth cohort of all births in 1 week in March 1958, includes information on physical activity frequency and BMI for several ages, 11-45 years. We examined relationships between activity in adolescence and trajectories of BMI between 16 years (or 23 years) and 45 years using multi-level models. Effects of change in activity on BMI and on change in BMI were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: Physical activity at 11 years had no effect on the BMI trajectories, in males or females. More active females at 16 years gained BMI more slowly than others, by 0.007 kg/m2/year per activity category over the period 16-45 years, whereas the most active males gained BMI faster than others, by 0.005 kg/m2/year per activity category. This effect in males was not evident on the BMI trajectory from 23 to 45 years. Consistent with these analyses, change in activity was associated with change in BMI in females, e.g. females active at 16 and 42 years gained less BMI than inactive females (2.1 vs 2.5 kg/m2/10 years). Results for males were inconsistent over the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may lessen the gains in BMI from adolescence onwards, but relationships vary with age, and in later adolescence show opposite effects for males and females. Decreasing activity between adolescence and mid-adulthood in males, and inactivity in both life stages in females may increase BMI gain.},\n  keywords = {Body mass index,Cohort studies,Exercise,Longitudinal studies,Motor activity,Obesity},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ZGQDAN4X/m-api-31cccbbf-3ca6-a2f3-5809-6b0d0d709465.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162953,"version":0},"$loki":761},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1198,"entry":"@article{Pather2003,\n  title = {The Sympathetic Contributions to the Cardiac Plexus},\n  author = {Pather, N. and Partab, P. and Singh, B. and Satyapal, K.

The 2 primary goals of providing artificial circulation and defibrillation to halt ventricular fibrillation remain of paramount importance for saving lives. They have undergone significant improvements in technology and dissemination into the community subsequent to their establishment 60 years ago. The evolution of artificial circulation includes efforts to optimize manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, external mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices designed to augment circulation, and may soon advance further into the rapid deployment of specially designed internal emergency cardiopulmonary bypass devices. The development of defibrillation technologies has progressed from bulky internal defibrillators paddles applied directly to the heart, to manually controlled external defibrillators, to automatic external defibrillators that can now be obtained over-the-counter for widespread use in the community or home. But the modern treatment of cardiac arrest now involves more than merely providing circulation and defibrillation. As suggested by a 3-phase model of treatment, newer approaches targeting patients who have had a more prolonged cardiac arrest include treatment of the metabolic phase of cardiac arrest with therapeutic hypothermia, agents to treat or prevent reperfusion injury, new strategies specifically focused on pulseless electric activity, which is the presenting rhythm in at least one third of cardiac arrests, and aggressive post resuscitation care. There are discoveries at the cellular and molecular level about ischemia and reperfusion pathobiology that may be translated into future new therapies.

In this study, we analyze the topography and structure of the human epicardiac neural plexus (ENP) as a system of seven ganglionated subplexuses. The morphology of the ENP was revealed by a histochemical method for acetylcholinesterase in whole hearts of 21 humans and examined by stereoscopic, contact, and bright-field microscopy. According to criteria established to distinguish ganglionated subplexuses, they are epicardiac extensions of mediastinal nerves entering the heart through discrete sites of the heart hilum and proceeding separately into regions of innervation by seven pathways, on the courses of which epicardiac ganglia, as wide ganglionated fields, are plentifully located. It was established that topography of epicardiac subplexuses was consistent from heart to heart. In general, the human right atrium was innervated by two subplexuses, the left atrium by three, the right ventricle by one, and the left ventricle by three subplexuses. The highest density of epicardiac ganglia was identified near the heart hilum, especially on the dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces of the left atrium, where up to 50\\% of all cardiac ganglia were located. The number of epicardiac ganglia identified for the human hearts in this study ranged from 706 up to 1,560 and was not correlated with age in most heart regions. The human heart contained on average 836 +/- 76 epicardiac ganglia. The structural organization of ganglia and nerves within subplexuses was observed to vary considerably from heart to heart and in relation to age. The number of neurons identified for any epicardiac ganglion was significantly fewer in aged human compared with infants. By estimating the number of neurons within epicardiac ganglia and relating this to the number of ganglia in the human epicardium, it was calculated that approximately 43,000 intrinsic neurons might be present in the ENP in adult hearts and 94,000 neurons in young hearts (fetuses, neonates, and children). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the total ENP in humans using staining for acetylcholinesterase, and provides a morphological framework for an understanding of how intrinsic ganglia and nerves are structurally organized within the human heart.},\n  keywords = {{Anatomy, human},Autonomic ganglia,Heart innervation,Intracardiac neurons,Intrinsic neural plexus}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162963,"version":0},"$loki":764},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1254,"entry":"@article{Pauza2013,\n  title = {Neuroanatomy of the Murine Cardiac Conduction System},\n  author = {Pauza, Dainius H. and Saburkina, Inga and Rysevaite, Kristina and Inokaitis, Hermanas and Jokubauskas, Marius and Jalife, José and Pauziene, Neringa},\n  date = {2013-06-01},\n  journaltitle = {Autonomic Neuroscience},\n  volume = {176},\n  number = {1-2},\n  pages = {32--47},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}},\n  issn = {15660702},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.autneu.2013.01.006},\n  url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566070213000088},\n  urldate = {2019-04-15},\n  abstract = {The mouse heart is a popular model to study the function and autonomic control of the specialized cardiac conduction system (CCS). However, the precise identity and anatomical distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that modulate the function of the mouse CCS have not been adequately studied. We aimed at determining the organization and distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that supply the CCS of the mouse. In whole mouse heart preparations, intrinsic neural structures were revealed by histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adrenergic, cholinergic and peptidergic neural components were identified, respectively, by immunohistochemical labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Myocytes of the CCS were identified by immunolabeling of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4). In addition, the presence of CCS myocytes in atypical locations was verified using fluorescent immunohistochemistry performed on routine paraffin sections. The results demonstrate that four microscopic epicardial nerves orientated toward the sinuatrial nodal (SAN) region derive from both the dorsal right atrial and right ventral nerve subplexuses. The atrioventricular nodal (AVN) region is typically supplied by a single intrinsic nerve derived from the left dorsal nerve subplexus at the posterior interatrial groove. SAN myocytes positive for HCN4 were widely distributed both on the medial, anterior, lateral and even posterior sides of the root of the right cranial (superior caval) vein. The distribution of HCN4-positive myocytes in the AVN region was also wider than previously considered.

The rabbit is widely used in experimental cardiac physiology, but the neuroanatomy of the rabbit heart remains insufficiently examined. This study aimed to ascertain the architecture of the intrinsic nerve plexus in the walls and septum of rabbit cardiac ventricles. In 51 rabbit hearts, a combined approach involving: (i) histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining of intrinsic neural structures in total cardiac ventricles; (ii) immunofluorescent labelling of intrinsic nerves, nerve fibres (NFs) and neuronal somata (NS); and (iii) transmission electron microscopy of intrinsic ventricular nerves and NFs was used. Mediastinal nerves access the ventral and lateral surfaces of both ventricles at a restricted site between the root of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The dorsal surface of both ventricles is supplied by several epicardial nerves extending from the left dorsal ganglionated nerve subplexus on the dorsal left atrium. Ventral accessing nerves are thicker and more numerous than dorsal nerves. Intrinsic ventricular NS are rare on the conus arteriosus and the root of the pulmonary trunk. The number of ventricular NS ranged from 11 to 220 per heart. Four chemical phenotypes of NS within ventricular ganglia were identified, i.e. ganglionic cells positive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and biphenotypic, i.e. positive for both ChAT/nNOS and for ChAT/tyrosine hydroxylase. Clusters of small intensely fluorescent cells are distributed within or close to ganglia on the root of the pulmonary trunk, but not on the conus arteriosus. The largest and most numerous intrinsic nerves proceed within the epicardium. Scarce nerves were found near myocardial blood vessels, but the myocardium contained only a scarce meshwork of NFs. In the endocardium, large numbers of thin nerves and NFs proceed along the bundle of His and both its branches up to the apex of the ventricles. The endocardial meshwork of fine NFs was approximately eight times denser than the myocardial meshwork. Adrenergic NFs predominate considerably in all layers of the ventricular walls and septum, whereas NFs of other neurochemical phenotypes were in the minority and their amount differed between the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium. The densities of NFs positive for nNOS and ChAT were similar in the epicardium and endocardium, but NFs positive for nNOS in the myocardium were eight times more abundant than NFs positive for ChAT. Potentially sensory NFs positive for both calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P were sparse in the myocardial layer, but numerous in epicardial nerves and particularly abundant within the endocardium. Electron microscopic observations demonstrate that intrinsic ventricular nerves have a distinctive morphology, which may be attributed to remodelling of the peripheral nerves after their access into the ventricular wall. In conclusion, the rabbit ventricles display complex structural organization of intrinsic ventricular nerves, NFs and ganglionic cells. The results provide a basic anatomical background for further functional analysis of the intrinsic nervous system in the cardiac ventricles.},\n  keywords = {CGRP,Choline acetyltransferase,Electron microscopy,Heart ventricles,Innervation,nNOS,PGP 9.5,Rabbit,SP,Tyrosine hydroxylase},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/AAPP5SSF/m-api-4aa20c6a-73a8-3773-2e94-1a3f96810611.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162971,"version":0},"$loki":766},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":836,"entry":"@article{Pennington1970,\n  title = {Chest {{Thump}} for {{Reverting Ventricular Tachycardia}}},\n  author = {Pennington, James E. and Taylor, Jack and Lown, Bernard},\n  date = {1970-11-26},\n  journaltitle = {New England Journal of Medicine},\n  volume = {283},\n  number = {22},\n  pages = {1192--1195},\n  issn = {0028-4793},\n  doi = {10.1056/NEJM197011262832204},\n  url = {http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM197011262832204},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/M2HMTWZV/1970 - Pennington, Taylor, Lown - Chest Thump for Reverting Ventricular Tachycardia.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162974,"version":0},"$loki":767},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1486,"entry":"@article{Perlis2016,\n  title = {Suicide and Sleep: {{Is}} It a Bad Thing to Be Awake When Reason Sleeps?},\n  author = {Perlis, Michael L and Grandner, Michael A and Chakravorty, Subhajit and Bernert, Rebecca A and Brown, Gregory K and Thase, Michael E},\n  date = {2016-10},\n  journaltitle = {Sleep Medicine Reviews},\n  volume = {29},\n  pages = {101--107},\n  issn = {10870792},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.smrv.2015.10.003},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087079215001471},\n  urldate = {2020-04-07},\n  abstract = {Suicide is the second leading cause of death, worldwide, for those between the ages of 24 and 44 y old. In 2013, more than 41,000 suicides occurred in the United States. These statistics underscore the need to 1) understand why people die by suicide and 2) identify risk factors that are potentially modifiable. While it has been posited that sleep disturbance may represent one such factor, systematic research in this arena did not begin until the 2000s. Since that time, sleep disturbance has been reliably identified as a risk factor for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. While insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disorders have each been found to contribute to the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior, it is also possible that these factors share some common variance. One possibility is that sleep disturbance results in being awake at night, and being awake at night also confers risk. The hypothesis proffered here is that being awake when one is not biologically prepared to be so results in \"hypofrontality\" and diminished executive function, and that this represents a common pathway to suicidal ideation and behavior. Such a proposition is highly testable under a variety of possible protocols. The current review summarizes the extant literature on suicide rates by time-of-day, and discusses circadian, psychosocial, and neurocognitive explanations of risk. Such a focus promises to enhance our understanding of how sleep disturbance may confer risk, allows for the identification of future lines of research, and further justifies the need for interventions that promote good sleep continuity among at-risk individuals.},\n  keywords = {Circadian patterning,Executive function,Hypofrontality,Sleep disturbance,Suicide},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/NC26CPAE/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162978,"version":0},"$loki":768},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1632,"entry":"@article{Peters1990,\n  title = {Sympathetic Blockade by Epidural Anesthesia Attenuates the Cardiovascular Response to Severe Hypoxemia},\n  author = {Peters, J. and Kutkuhn, B. and Medert, H.

The authors investigated whether hormonal systems support arterial pressure and how the circulation copes with a hypoxic challenge when activation of the sympathetic nervous system is selectively impaired by neural blockade. Accordingly, the effects of high epidural anesthesia alone and combined with hypoxia were evaluated in seven awake trained dogs. On different days, either bupivacaine 0.5\\% (8-12 ml) or saline (placebo) were randomly injected epidurally and the effects evaluated on cardiovascular (arterial pressure, heart rate) and respiratory (blood gases, oxygen consumption) variables, as well as on hormone plasma concentrations (vasopressin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, renin) during both normoxia and hypoxia. During epidural anesthesia alone, vasopressin increased tenfold (1.7 pg/ml ± 1.0 SD to 16.8 ± 13.8 P {$<$} 0.05), norepinephrine decreased (90 pg/ml ± 31 to 61 ± 28, P {$<$} 0.05) while epinephrine and renin concentrations remained unchanged. Mean arterial and pulse pressure decreased by 13 mmHg and 23 mmHg (P {$<$} 0.05), respectively. In dogs without sympathetic blockade (saline group), hypoxemia (Pa(O2): 31 ± 4 mmHg) evoked an increase in mean blood pressure by 37 mmHg ± 8 and heart rate by 50 beats per min ± 17. In contrast, in the presence of sympathetic blockade but with a similar degree of hypoxemia, blood pressure failed to increase (+1 mmHg ± 14) and heart rate rose by only 15 beats per min ± 11. These differences between groups were statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.001). Hypoxemia induced a similar hypocarbia (Pa(CO2): 25 mmHg) in both groups, indicating that the ventilatory response to hypoxemia was preserved after epidural blockade. During hypoxemia vasopressin concentrations increased 35-fold to 64 pg/ml ± 38 (P {$<$} 0.0001) compared to base line only during epidural anesthesia, but not after epidural saline (2 pg/ml ± 2), while other hormones showed no significant differences. The authors conclude that high epidural anesthesia in awake unsedated dogs: 1) almost completely abolishes the normal cardiovascular response to hypoxemia while promoting vasopressin secretion; 2) preserves the ventilatory response to hypoxemia; and 3) is associated with increased vasopressin concentrations, most likely to compensate for decreased cardiac filling and/or arterial blood pressure when sympathoadrenal responses are impaired. Thus, the changes in cardiovascular vital signs in response to severe hypoxemia are markedly blunted when spinal sympathetic outflow is selectively eliminated by epidural anesthesia.},\n  keywords = {Anesthetic techniques: epidural,catecholamines,Complications: hypoxemia,Hormones: vasopressin (ADH),Renin,response,Sympathetic nervous system: sympathectomy,Ventilation: hypoxemia},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/GRRH5UJV/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708162985,"version":0},"$loki":769},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2030,"entry":"@book{Petko2021,\n  title = {Neuroanatomy, {{Nucleus Ambiguus}}},\n  author = {Petko, Bogdana and Tadi, Prasanna},\n  date = {2021-07-25},\n  journaltitle = {StatPearls},\n  eprint = {31613524},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  publisher = {{StatPearls Publishing}},\n  url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547744/},\n  urldate = {2022-11-08},\n  abstract = {The nucleus ambiguus is the common nucleus of the efferent fibers for glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves.

These and other circadian rhythms at all levels of organization are orchestrated by a central biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Preservation of the normal circadian time structure from the level of the cardiomyocyte to the organ system appears to be essential for cardiovascular health and cardiovascular disease prevention. Myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarct, and sudden cardiac death are much greater in incidence than expected in the morning. Moreover, supraventricular and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias of various types show specific day-night patterns, with atrial arrhythmias - premature beats, tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and flutter - generally being of higher frequency during the day than night - and ventricular fibrillation and ventricular premature beats more common, respectively, in the morning and during the daytime activity than sleep span. Furthermore, different circadian patterns of blood pressure are found in arterial hypertension, in relation to different cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Such temporal patterns result from circadian periodicity in pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to predictable-in-time differences in susceptibility-resistance to cyclic environmental stressors that trigger these clinical events. Circadian rhythms also may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular and other medications.

Similarly, endurance exercise training results in preconditioned skeletal muscle fibers that are resistant to a variety of stresses (e.g., heat stress, exercise-induced oxidative stress, and inactivity-induced atrophy). Many studies have probed the mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers; these studies are important, because they provide an improved understanding of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning, which has the potential to lead to innovative pharmacological therapies aimed at minimizing stress-induced injury to cardiac and skeletal muscle.

Normoxic myocytes were exposed to the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10-8-10-6 M) or the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10-9-10-6 M) during pacing at different frequencies (0.5-4 Hz). α-Adrenergic stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent prolongation of action potential duration but failed to induce either EADs or DADs. β-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol at low concentrations (10-9-10-8 M) induced a prolongation of the action potential, whereas higher concentrations (10-7 and 10-6 M) resulted in a marked shortening. Isoproterenol elicited single or multiple (2-5) DADs at concentrations from 10-8 to 10-6 M, with a corresponding increase in the amplitude of the DADs and decrease in the coupling interval as cells were paced at increasing rates. DADs often initiated and maintained sustained triggered rhythms that spontaneously terminated. Isoproterenol (10-8 - 10-6 M) also elicited EADs in 80\\% of cells at the highest concentration utilized (10-6 M) and at intermediate pacing frequencies (1-2 Hz). EADs often occurred with a 2:1 or 3:1 pattern. EADs and DADs induced by isoproterenol were reversibly abolished by low extracellular sodium, ryanodine (10-6 M), or benzamil (10-4 M), thus indicating that Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and extracellular Na+ concentration are two major factors in the development of both types of afterdepolarizations. The demonstration that EADs can be induced by isoproterenol in ventricular muscle suggest a novel pathway for β-adrenergic receptors to mediate arrhythmogenesis in the intact heart.},\n  issue = {6 27-6},\n  keywords = {arrhythmias,calcium,isolated myocytes,triggered rhythms}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163015,"version":0},"$loki":778},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2003,"entry":"@article{Prystowsky2021,\n  title = {Atrioventricular {{Conduction}}: {{Physiology}} and {{Autonomic Influences}}},\n  author = {Prystowsky, Eric N and Gilge, Jasen L},\n  date = {2021},\n  journaltitle = {Cardiac Electrophysiology Clinics},\n  volume = {13},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {34689888},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {585--598},\n  issn = {18779190},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.ccep.2021.06.004},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccep.2021.06.004},\n  urldate = {2022-09-19},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,AV node,AV node reentry,Conduction,His-Purkinje system,Parasympathetic,Sympathetic,WPW reentry},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/PUL6PYB4/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163019,"version":0},"$loki":779},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2130,"entry":"@article{rajendran2023,\n  title = {The Vagus Nerve in Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathophysiology: {{From}} Evolutionary Insights to Clinical Medicine},\n  author = {Rajendran, Pradeep S. and Hadaya, Joseph and Khalsa, Sahib S. and Yu, Chuyue and Chang, Rui and Shivkumar, Kalyanam},\n  date = {2023-01},\n  journaltitle = {Seminars in Cell \\& Developmental Biology},\n  issn = {10849521},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.semcdb.2023.01.001},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084952123000010},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/QV5U85JQ/1-s2.0-S1084952123000010-main.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163020,"version":0},"$loki":780},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1251,"entry":"@article{Randall2003,\n  title = {Interactions within the Intrinsic Cardiac Nervous System Contribute to Chronotropic Regulation},\n  author = {Randall, David C and Brown, David R and McGuirt, A.

Surgical ablation of the PAGP (PAGPx) attenuated vagally mediated bradycardia by 26\\%; it reduced heart rate slowing evoked by vagal stimulation superimposed on sympathetically mediated tachycardia by 36\\%. RAGP ablation (RAGPx) eliminated vagally mediated bradycardia, while retaining the vagally induced suppression of sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-83\\%). After combined RAGPx and PAGPx, vagal stimulation still reduced sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-47\\%). After RAGPx alone and after PAGPx alone, stimulation of the vagi still produced negative dromotropic effects, although these changes were attenuated compared with the intact state. Negative dromotropic responses to vagal stimulation were further attenuated after combined ablation, but parasympathetic inhibition of atrioventricular nodal conduction was still demonstrable in most animals. Finally, neither RAGPx nor PAGPx altered autonomic regulation of right atrial inotropic function. These data indicate that multiple aggregates of neurons within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system are involved in sinoatrial nodal regulation. Whereas parasympathetic efferent neurons regulating the right atrium, including the sinoatrial node, are primarily located within the RAGP, prejunctional parasympathetic-sympathetic interactions regulating right atrial function also involve neurons within the PAGP.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163023,"version":0},"$loki":781},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1511,"entry":"@article{Refinetti2007,\n  title = {Procedures for Numerical Analysis of Circadian Rhythms},\n  author = {Refinetti, Roberto and Cornélissen, Germaine and Halberg, Franz},\n  date = {2007},\n  journaltitle = {Biological Rhythm Research},\n  volume = {38},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {275--325},\n  issn = {09291016},\n  doi = {10.1080/09291010600903692},\n  url = {https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=nbrr20},\n  urldate = {2020-04-21},\n  abstract = {This article reviews various procedures used in the analysis of circadian rhythms at the populational, organismal, cellular and molecular levels.

The Physicians' Health Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of alternate-day aspirin intake (325 mg) among 22,071 US male physicians, afforded the opportunity to assess this circadian pattern and examine whether it is altered by aspirin therapy. During a 5-year period of follow-up, 342 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction were confirmed, of which the time of onset was available in 211 (62\\%). The placebo group showed a bimodal circadian variation in onset of myocardial infarction with a primary peak between 4:00 AM and 10:00 AM (p less than 0.001). In the aspirin group, however, this circadian variation was minimal (p = 0.16), due primarily to a marked reduction in the morning peak of infarction. Specifically, aspirin was associated with a 59.3\\% reduction in the incidence of infarction during the morning waking hours, compared with a 34.1\\% reduction for the remaining hours of the day. The greater reduction was observed during the 3-hour interval immediately after awakening, a period with a risk of infarction twice that of any other comparable time interval (p less than 0.001). Aspirin intake was associated with a mean reduction in the incidence of infarction of 44.8\\% over the entire 24-hour cycle. These data support the hypothesis that increased platelet aggregability in the morning and upon arising contributes to the occurrence of myocardial infarction and that aspirin reduces the risk of infarction by inhibiting platelet aggregation during these critical periods.},\n  isbn = {0009-7322 (Print)\\textbackslash r0009-7322 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {*Circadian Rhythm,80 and over,Adult,Aged,Aspirin/*therapeutic use,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Myocardial Infarction/*physiopathology/prevention,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/6YN2T555/Ridker et al. - 1990 - Circadian variation of acute myocardial infarction and the effect of low-dose aspirin in a randomized trial of ph.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163031,"version":0},"$loki":784},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1235,"entry":"@article{Ripplinger2016,\n  title = {The Nervous Heart},\n  author = {Ripplinger, Crystal M and Noujaim, Sami F and Linz, Dominik},\n  date = {2016},\n  journaltitle = {Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology},\n  volume = {120},\n  number = {1-3},\n  pages = {199--209},\n  issn = {00796107},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.12.015},\n  abstract = {Many cardiac electrophysiological abnormalities are accompanied by autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor involved in modulation of coronary vasomotor tone and may play a role in microvascular angina. Methods We compared the effects of NPY (0.2–1.0 pmol/kg, intracoronary) on the vasomotor response of proximal and distal segments of the coronary arteries in 7 patients with microvascular angina, 9 with chronic stable angina, and 9 control individuals. The coronary response to the administration of ergonovine was also assessed in 9 other patients with microvascular angina. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurements were carried out before (baseline) and after the administration of the vasoactive agents. Results Mean baseline coronary lumen diameters were similar in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients. NPY constricted proximal coronary segments by 8 ± 2\\%, 5 ± 2\\% and 6 ± 3\\% and distal segments by 14 ± 2\\%, 11 ± 2\\% and 10 ± 2\\% in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients, respectively (p = NS between groups). In patients with microvascular angina, ergonovine constricted proximal coronary segments by 7 ± 1.5\\% and distal segments by 12.5 ± 3\\% (p = NS vs. NPY). During NPY administration four microvascular angina patients developed chest pain, ST segment depression, and a marked lengthening of the contrast medium run off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm. Control individuals and coronary artery disease patients did not experience chest pain, ST segment shifts, or lengthening of the run off during NPY administration. Ergonovine administration caused chest pain and lengthening of the contrast run-off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm, in one microvascular angina patient. Conclusions Exogenous NPY causes mild epicardial coronary artery constriction which is similar in patients with non-cardiac chest pain, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia and marked lengthening of the contrast run off in response to NPY occurred in microvascular angina patients but not in control or coronary artery disease patients. An abnormal constrictor response to NPY at the microcirculation level could be the mechanism underlying the ischemic manifestations observed in patients with microvascular angina. Condensed abstract (table of contents) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal coronary artery segments was studied in twenty five patients: 7 microvascular angina, 9 chronic stable angina, and 9 control subjects. Computerized measurements of coronary diameters were carried out before and after the intracoronary administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ergonovine. Constriction of epicardial arteries in response to NPY was mild and not significantly different in control, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease patients. Ergonovine-induced epicardial coronary artery constriction was similar to that of NPY. However, NPY caused transient myocardial ischemia in patients with microvascular angina (probably through constriction of the small intramyocardial vessels), but not in control subjects or coronary artery disease patients.},\n  keywords = {Coronary reactivity,Left ventricular dysfunction,Microvascular angina,Neuropeptide Y,Syndrome X}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163040,"version":0},"$loki":786},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1574,"entry":"@article{Rowe2008,\n  title = {Good Night and Good Luck: {{Norepinephrine}} in Sleep Pharmacology},\n  author = {Mitchell, Heather A. and Weinshenker, David},\n  date = {2010-03},\n  journaltitle = {Biochemical Pharmacology},\n  volume = {79},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {1000000221},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {801--809},\n  issn = {00062952},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.bcp.2009.10.004},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006295209008569},\n  abstract = {Sleep is a crucial biological process that is regulated through complex interactions between multiple brain regions and neuromodulators. As sleep disorders can have deleterious impacts on health and quality of life, a wide variety of pharmacotherapies have been developed to treat conditions of excessive wakefulness and excessive sleepiness. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), through its involvement in the ascending arousal system, impacts the efficacy of many wake- and sleep-promoting medications. Wake-promoting drugs such as amphetamine and modafinil increase extracellular levels of NE, enhancing transmission along the wake-promoting pathway. GABAergic sleep-promoting medications like benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs that act more specifically on benzodiazepine receptors increase the activity of GABA, which inhibits NE transmission and the wake-promoting pathway. Melatonin and related compounds increase sleep by suppressing the activity of the neurons in the brain's circadian clock, and NE influences the synthesis of melatonin. Antihistamines block the wake-promoting effects of histamine, which shares reciprocal signaling with NE. Many antidepressants that affect the signaling of NE are also used for treatment of insomnia. Finally, adrenergic receptor antagonists that are used to treat cardiovascular disorders have considerable sedative effects. Therefore, NE, long known for its role in maintaining general arousal, is also a crucial player in sleep pharmacology. The purpose of this review is to consider the role of NE in the actions of wake- and sleep-promoting drugs within the framework of the brain arousal systems. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It is most frequently caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias: Monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsade de pointes (TdP), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Beta blockade, ACE inhibition, coronary reperfusion and other treatments have reduced the incidence of VT but pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is increasingly seen, particularly in patients with advanced chronic heart disease. From existing data, bradyarrhythmia in the form of asystole (usually complete heart block without escape rhythm) causes only a minor proportion (10-15\\%) of SCD. In patients aged 50 years and more, coronary artery disease plays a dominant role causing more than 75\\% of SCD cases, either by acute ischemia and ventricular fibrillation or by chronic scar formation and reentrant VT. In younger patients, SCD may occur in patients with structurally normal hearts. A number of arrhythmogenic disorders with an increased risk of SCD have been detected and better understood recently, such as long and short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and the early repolarization syndrome. Most importantly, ECG signs and clinical features indicating high risk for SCD have been identified. Knowledge of the exact electrophysiologic mechanisms of ventricular tachyarrhythmias at the cellular level has been improved and mechanisms such as phase 2 reentry and reflection proposed to better understand why and how SCD occurs. © 2014, Cardiological Society of India.

A wide range of platforms exist to model and study disorders associated with sudden cardiac death. Human clinical studies are cumbersome and are thwarted by the extent of investigation that can be performed on human subjects. Animal models are limited by their degree of homology to human cardiac electrophysiology, including ion channel expression. Most commonly used cellular models are cellular transfection models, which are able to mimic the expression of a single-ion channel offering incomplete insight into changes of the action potential profile. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes resemble, but are not identical, adult human cardiomyocytes and provide a new platform for studying arrhythmic disorders leading to sudden cardiac death.

This pattern is generally believed to be caused by the day/night distribution of behavioral triggers, but it is unknown whether the endogenous circadian system contributes to these daily fluctuations. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that the circadian system modulates autonomic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic risk markers at rest, and that behavioral stressors have different effects when they occur at different internal circadian phases. Twelve healthy adults were each studied in a 240-h forced desynchrony protocol in dim light while standardized rest and exercise periods were uniformly distributed across the circadian cycle. At rest, there were large circadian variations in plasma cortisol (peak-to-trough ≈85\\% of mean, peaking at a circadian phase corresponding to ≈9:00 AM) and in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, ≈70\\%; norepinephrine, ≈35\\%, peaking during the biological day). At ≈8:00 PM, there was a circadian peak in blood pressure and a trough in cardiac vagal modulation. Sympathetic variables were consistently lowest and vagal markers highest during the biological night. We detected no simple circadian effect on hemostasis, although platelet aggregability had two peaks: at ≈noon and ≈11:00 PM. There was circadian modulation of the cardiovascular reactivity to exercise, with greatest vagal withdrawal at ≈9:00 AM and peaks in catecholamine reactivity at ≈9:00 AM and ≈9:00 PM. Thus, the circadian system modulates numerous cardiovascular risk markers at rest as well as their reactivity to exercise, with resultant profiles that could potentially contribute to the day/night pattern of adverse cardiovascular events.},\n  isbn = {1091-6490 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0027-8424 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {circadian,diurnal},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/J53MDRYW/Scheer et al. - 2010 - Impact of the human circadian system, exercise, and their interaction on cardiovascular function.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163075,"version":0},"$loki":793},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1147,"entry":"@article{Schnell2001a,\n  title = {Cardiac Sympathetic Innervation and Blood Flow Regulation of the Diabetic Heart},\n  author = {Schnell, Oliver},\n  date = {2001},\n  journaltitle = {Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews},\n  volume = {17},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {243--245},\n  issn = {15207552},\n  doi = {10.1002/dmrr.220},\n  abstract = {A key problem in ischemia-induced impairment of the vascular performance of the diabetic heart is the often-unrecognized cardiac sympathetic dysfunction.

In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the cervical spine, like other sections of the spine and sacroiliac joints, is vulnerable during the disease process. Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) has been studied in connection with AS, but its risk factors and progression have not been clarified. Therefore, this study assessed the prevalence and risk factors of AAS in patients with AS. Methods. A total of 819 patients with AS who fulfilled the modified New York criteria and were examined with a full-flexion lateral view of the cervical spine by radiograph were enrolled from an outpatient clinic. The medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed and the anterior atlantodental interval (AADI) in the lateral flexion view of the cervical spine radiograph was investigated by 2 experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. We defined the AAS as an AADI of {$>$} 3 mm, and progression of AADI as a progression rate {$>$} 0.5 mm/year. Results. AAS was found in 14.1\\% (116/819) of patients. Progression of AADI occurred in 32.1\\% (26/81) patients with AAS and 5.0\\% (16/320) patients without AAS (p {$<$} 0.001). The development of AAS was significantly associated with elevated C-reactive protein [CRP; OR 2.19 (1.36-3.53)], peripheral arthritis [OR 2.05 (1.36-3.07)], use of anti-tumor necrosis factor antagonists because of failure of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [NSAID/DMARD; OR 2.28 (1.52-3.42)], and uveitis [OR 1.71 (1.13-2.59)]. These factors were adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration by logistic regression analysis. No clear association was found for HLA-B27, seropositivity, or smoking status with AAS. Conclusion. AAS is a frequent complication, and the progression of AADI was more rapid in cases with AAS. The presence of peripheral arthritis, or high disease activity with elevated CRP level or refractory to conventional NSAID/DMARD, independently increased the risk of AAS, suggesting that clinicians should focus on the detection and monitoring of AAS, especially in cases with associated risk factors.

Autonomic dysfunction, measured by low heart rate variability (HRV), can occur with myocardial ischemia. Testing for low HRV may help to identify high-risk, asymptomatic individuals. The association of low HRV with ischemia may also be greatest during the morning hours, when cardiac events (MI, sudden death) are most likely to be triggered. Hypothesis: In a cohort of veteran males with no known CAD, subclinical myocardial ischemia is associated with autonomic dysfunction as measured by low HRV; this association is greatest during morning hours. Methods: We evaluated 24-hour ambulatory ECGs in middle-aged twins without known CAD from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, and calculated frequency domain and non-linear (Dyx) HRV metrics. All subjects underwent [13N]-ammonia positron emission tomography with adenosine stress, with ischemia defined as greater than 5\\% perfusion deficit. Mixed models were used to compare HRV between ischemic and non-ischemic subjects in 1-hour intervals, and morning hours were 6 AM until 10 AM. Results: Data on 276 twin subjects were analyzed; the mean age (SD) was 53 (3) and 55 (20\\%) had ischemia. HRV was significantly different between ischemic and non-ischemic twins during morning hours (figure 1), with the largest magnitude difference occurring with Dyx at 7 AM. Each SD decrease in Dyx associated with an OR for ischemia of 4.8 (95\\% CI, 1.5 — 15.8). Dyx in morning hours remained significant in a subgroup of pairs discordant for ischemia and after risk factor adjustment. Significant differences by ischemia status were noted for low-frequency and very-low-frequency HRV. Conclusions: Lower HRV is strongly associated with subclinical myocardial ischemia primarily during morning hours. More research regarding this circadian autonomic vulnerability and its clinical implications are warranted.},\n  issue = {Suppl\\_1}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163096,"version":0},"$loki":799},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1772,"entry":"@article{Shah2021b,\n  title = {Cardiovascular {{Pathophysiology}} from the {{Cardioneural Perspective}} and Its {{Clinical Applications}}},\n  author = {Shah, Amit J. and Wittbrodt, Matthew T. and Bremner, J.

PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 enhances channel activity by sensitizing the channel to cytosolic calcium (Ca²+). Here, we found that mice harboring RyR2 channels that cannot be PKA phosphorylated (referred to herein as RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice) exhibited blunted heart rate and cardiac contractile responses to catecholamines (isoproterenol).

Decades of research has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac autonomic nervous system and provided evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias. The mechanisms by which autonomic activation is arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic are complex and different for specific arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation, simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activations are the most common trigger. In contrast, in ventricular fibrillation in the setting of cardiac ischemia, sympathetic activation is proarrhythmic, whereas parasympathetic activation is antiarrhythmic. In inherited arrhythmia syndromes, sympathetic stimulation precipitates ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death except in Brugada and J-wave syndromes where it can prevent them. The identification of specific autonomic triggers in different arrhythmias has brought the idea of modulating autonomic activities for both preventing and treating these arrhythmias. This has been achieved by either neural ablation or stimulation. Neural modulation as a treatment for arrhythmias has been well established in certain diseases, such as long QT syndrome. However, in most other arrhythmia diseases, it is still an emerging modality and under investigation. Recent preliminary trials have yielded encouraging results.

All of these lead to significant arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as ventricular arrhythmias, and are known risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD). The association between LVH and SCD is well established, especially in the presence of myocardial ischemia, fibrosis and scar tissue, and AF. Inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress, as well as ischemia play a significant role and are the leading pathways to remodeling, arrhythmias, and SCD. Aggressive HTN control may lead, at least in part, to regression of LVH and thus lower the risk of AF and SCD. Therefore, LVH is a powerful, independent predictor of AF, ventricular arrhythmias and SCD, and is significantly underrecognized.

The objective of the present study was to non-invasively characterize autonomic function and additional physiologic changes during sleep onset in normal and abnormal sleep. The estimation of autonomic function was based on time-frequency analysis of the RR interval series, using the power components in the very-low-frequency range (0.005-0.04 Hz), low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz), and high-frequency range (0.15-0.5 Hz). The ratio of low to high frequency power represented the sympathovagal balance. Thirty-four subjects who underwent whole night polysomnography were divided into 3 groups according to their complaints and study results: normal subjects, apneic patients (OSAS), and subjects with various sleep disorders (VSD). The results indicated a significant increase in RR interval during sleep onset, although its variability decreased; respiratory rate did not change, yet respiration became more stable; EMG amplitude and its variability decreased with sleep onset. Very-low-frequency power started to decrease significantly 2 min before sleep onset in all groups; low-frequency power decreased and high-frequency power did not change significantly in all groups, accordingly their ratio decreased and reflected a shift towards parasympathetic predominance. Although autonomic function displayed similar behavior in all subjects, OSAS and VSD patients presented a higher sympathovagal balance reflecting enhanced sympathetic predominance in those groups compared to normal subjects, both before and after sleep onset. All parameters reached a nadir at a defined time point during the process of falling asleep. We conclude that the wake-sleep transition period represents a transitional process between two physiologically different states; this transition starts with a decrease in the very slow oscillations in heart rate that anticipates a step-change resetting of autonomic function, followed by a decrease in sympathovagal balance towards the end of the process. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Animal model studies of heart and visceral organ hypertrophy predict that nerve growth factor levels should be elevated in heart failure; whether this is so in human heart failure, though, remains unclear. We tested the hypotheses that neurons in cardiac ganglia are hypertrophied in human, canine, and rat heart failure and that nerve growth factor, which we hypothesize is elevated in the failing heart, contributes to this neuronal hypertrophy. Somal morphology of neurons from human (579.54±14.34 versus 327.45±9.17 μm(2); P{$<$}0.01) and canine hearts (767.80±18.37 versus 650.23±9.84 μm(2); P{$<$}0.01) failing secondary to ischemia and neurons from spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts (327.98±3.15 versus 271.29±2.79 μm(2); P{$<$}0.01) failing secondary to hypertension reveal significant hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia compared with controls. Western blot analysis shows that nerve growth factor levels in the explanted, failing human heart are 250\\% greater than levels in healthy donor hearts. Neurons from cardiac ganglia cultured with nerve growth factor are significantly larger and have greater dendritic arborization than neurons in control cultures. Hypertrophied neurons are significantly less excitable than smaller ones; thus, hypertrophy of vagal postganglionic neurons in cardiac ganglia would help to explain the parasympathetic withdrawal that accompanies heart failure. Furthermore, our observations suggest that nerve growth factor, which is elevated in the failing human heart, causes hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163127,"version":0},"$loki":809},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1926,"entry":"@article{Sposato2020a,\n  title = {Post-{{Stroke Cardiovascular Complications}} and {{Neurogenic Cardiac Injury}}: {{JACC State-of-the-Art Review}}},\n  author = {Sposato, Luciano A. and Hilz, Max J. and Aspberg, Sara and Murthy, Santosh B. and Bahit, M.

Reduction in slow wave sleep, decreased latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and abnormalities in the timing of REM/non-REM sleep cycles have all been documented in patients with MDD. It is thus evident that an understanding of the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation is essential for an analysis of the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which functions as the body's master circadian clock, plays a major role in the regulation of the sleep/wakefulness rhythm and interacts actively with the homeostatic processes that regulate sleep. The control of melatonin secretion by the SCN, the occurrence of high concentrations of melatonin receptors in the SCN, and the suppression of electrical activity in the SCN by melatonin all underscore the major influence which this neurohormone has in regulating the sleep/wake cycle. The transition from wakefulness to high sleep propensity is associated with the nocturnal rise of endogenous melatonin secretion. Various lines of evidence show that depressed patients exhibit disturbances in both the amplitude and shape of the melatonin secretion rhythm and that melatonin can improve the quality of sleep in these patients. The choice of a suitable antidepressant that improves sleep quality is thus important while treating a depressive disorder. The novel antidepressant agomelatine, which combines the properties of a 5-HT2C antagonist and a melatonergic MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, has been found very effective for resetting the disturbed sleep/wake cycle and in improving the clinical status of MDD. Agomelatine has also been found useful in treating sleep problems and improving the clinical status of patients suffering from seasonal affective disorder. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

More recently, however, indirect evidence for the existence of cardiac receptors that are either silent or exhibit low resting rates of activity, and discharge into slowly conducting C-type fibers, has been demonstrated. The receptors themselves have not yet been identified histologically. Cardiac receptors include subpopulations that are preferenthlly activated by chemical stimuli, including a variety of exogenous chemicals as well as prostaglandins. Another subpopulation is preferentially activated by mechanical stresses in the physiological range. Further investigation may reveal their participation in overall cardiovascular regulation, and mediation of responses to exogenous chemical stimuli. Four principal cardiac sympathetic nerves have been identified in the right thoracic region and three on the left. Most carry sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers.

This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients.

The goal of this prospective, multicenter study was to determine whether EGM TWA/V was greater before VT/VF than at baseline. Methods and Results-We enrolled 63 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients. TWA/V was computed from stored EGMs before spontaneous VT/VF and from sequential windows of 8 pairs of beats using 4 different control recordings: baseline rhythm, rapid pacing at 105 bpm, segments of ambulatory Holter EGMs matched to the time of VT/VF episodes, and EGMs before spontaneous supraventricular tachycardia. During follow-up, 28 patients had 166 episodes of VT/VF. TWA/V was greater before VT/VF (62.9±3.1 μV; n=28) than during baseline rhythm (12.8±1.8 μV; P{$<$}0.0001; n=62), during rapid pacing (14.5±2.0 μV; P{$<$}0.0001; n=52), before supraventricular tachycardia (27.5±6.1 μV; P{$<$}0.0001; n=9), or during time-matched ambulatory controls (12.3±3.5 μV; P{$<$}0.0001; n=16). By logistic regression, the odds of VT/VF increased by a factor of 2.2 for each 10-μV increment in TWA/V (P{$<$}0.0001). Conclusions-In implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients, EGM TWA/V is greater before spontaneous VT/VF than in control recordings. Future implantable cardioverter-defibrillators that measure EGM TWA/V continuously may warn patients and initiate pacing therapies to prevent VT/VF. © 2011 American Heart Association.

There is now substantial evidence that higher brain function (cortex), the brain stem and autonomic nerves affect cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, and that these may function as an interactive system. The roles of mental stress and emotion in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death are no longer confined to the realms of anecdote. Advances in molecular cardiology have identified cardiac cellular ion channel mutations conferring vulnerability to arrhythmic death at the myocardial level. Indeed, specific channelopathies such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome are selectively sensitive to either sympathetic or vagal stimulation. There is increasing evidence that afferent feedback from the heart to the higher centres may affect efferent input to the heart and modulate the cardiac electrophysiology. The new era of functional neuroimaging has identified the central neural circuitry in this brain-heart axis. Since precipitants of sudden fatal arrhythmia are frequently environmental and behavioural, central pathways translating stress into autonomic effects on the heart might be considered as therapeutic targets. These brain-heart interactions help explain the apparent randomness of sudden cardiac events and provide new insights into future novel therapies to prevent sudden death.},\n  isbn = {1468-201X (Electronic)\\textbackslash r1355-6037 (Linking)},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/QFW2DD8L/2011 - Taggart, Critchley, Lambiase - Heart-brain interactions in cardiac arrhythmia.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163155,"version":0},"$loki":818},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2136,"entry":"@article{takayama2020,\n  title = {Selective {{Induction}} of {{Human Autonomic Neurons Enables Precise Control}} of {{Cardiomyocyte Beating}}},\n  author = {Takayama, Yuzo and Kushige, Hiroko and Akagi, Yuka and Suzuki, Yutaka and Kumagai, Yutaro and Kida, Yasuyuki S.},\n  date = {2020-12-01},\n  journaltitle = {Scientific Reports},\n  volume = {10},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {32528170},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  publisher = {{Nature Research}},\n  issn = {20452322},\n  doi = {10.1038/s41598-020-66303-3},\n  abstract = {The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates tissue homeostasis and remodelling through antagonistic effects of noradrenergic sympathetic and cholinergic parasympathetic signalling.

Considering the antagonistic effects of noradrenergic and cholinergic inputs on target organs, both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons are expected to be induced. This study aimed to develop a stepwise chemical induction method to induce sympathetic-like and parasympathetic-like ANS neurons. Autonomic specification was achieved through restricting signals inducing sensory or enteric neurogenesis and activating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals. Global mRNA expression analyses after stepwise induction, including single-cell RNA-seq analysis of induced neurons and functional assays revealed that each induced sympathetic-like or parasympathetic-like neuron acquired pharmacological and electrophysiological functional properties with distinct marker expression. Further, we identified selective induction methods using appropriate seeding cell densities and neurotrophic factor concentrations. Neurons were individually induced, facilitating the regulation of the beating rates of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in an antagonistic manner. The induction methods yield specific neuron types, and their influence on various tissues can be studied by co-cultured assays.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/2XNIBD4N/takayama-2020_induction-of-cardiac-autonomic-neurons-in-ipsc.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163158,"version":0},"$loki":819},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1100,"entry":"@article{Taylor2011,\n  title = {Diurnal Variation in the Mechanical and Neural Components of the Baroreflex},\n  author = {Taylor, Chloe E. and Atkinson, Greg and Willie, Christopher K. and Jones, Helen and Ainslie, Philip N. and Tzeng, Yu Chieh},\n  date = {2011},\n  journaltitle = {Hypertension},\n  volume = {58},\n  number = {1},\n  eprint = {21632473},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {51--56},\n  issn = {0194911X},\n  doi = {10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.171512},\n  url = {http://ahajournals.org},\n  urldate = {2018-09-29},\n  abstract = {Diminished baroreflex sensitivity in the morning negatively influences morning coronary blood flow and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.

Beat-to-beat blood pressure, R-R intervals, and carotid artery diameter measurements were recorded. Integrated sensitivity was determined by plotting R-R intervals against systolic blood pressure. The mechanical component was carotid artery diameter plotted against systolic blood pressure, and the neural component was R-R intervals plotted against carotid artery diameter. Linear mixed models were used to compare the integrated, mechanical, and neural sensitivities between morning and afternoon. We found significant diurnal variation in integrated sensitivity, with an attenuated response in the morning (G(up)=13.0±0.6; G(down)=6.3±0.4 ms/mm Hg) when compared with the afternoon (G(up)=15.1±0.6; G(down)=12.6±0.4 ms/mm Hg). For rising pressures, the diminished integrated sensitivity in the morning was caused by a reduction in mechanical sensitivity, whereas for falling pressures it was caused by a reduction in neural sensitivity.

These changes are controlled in part by variations in the level of inhibitory control exerted on the heart by the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system (PNS). This originates from preganglionic neurons in the nucleus ambiguous that supply phasic, respiration-related activity to the cardiac branch of the vagus nerve, via myelinated, efferent fibres with rapid conduction velocities. An elaboration of these central mechanisms, under the control of a ‘vagal system’ has been endowed by psychologists with multiple functions concerned with ‘social engagement’ in mammals and, in particular, humans. Long-term study of cardiorespiratory interactions (CRI) in other major groups of vertebrates has established that they all show both tonic and phasic control of heart rate, imposed by the PNS. This derives centrally from neurones located in variously distributed nuclei, supplying the heart via fast-conducting, myelinated, efferent fibres. Water-breathing vertebrates, which include fishes and larval amphibians, typically show direct, 1:1 CRI between heart beats and gill ventilation, controlled from the dorsal vagal motor nucleus. In air-breathing, ectothermic vertebrates, including reptiles, amphibians and lungfish, CRI mirroring RSA have been shown to improve oxygen uptake during phasic ventilation by changes in perfusion of their respiratory organs, due to shunting of blood over across their undivided hearts. This system may constitute the evolutionary basis of that generating RSA in mammals, which now lacks a major physiological role in respiratory gas exchange, due to their completely divided systemic and pulmonary circulations.},\n  keywords = {Autonomic nervous system,Cardiorespiratory interactions,Heart rate variability,Parasympathetic,Respiratory sinus arrhythmia,Vagus nerve},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WDTBZI96/taylor-2022_vertebrates-and-polyvagal-theory.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163164,"version":0},"$loki":821},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1229,"entry":"@article{Thames1996,\n  title = {Reflexes Mediated by Cardiac Sympathetic Afferents during Myocardial Ischaemia: Role of Adenosine.},\n  author = {Thames, M D and Dibner-Dunlap, M E and Minisi, A J and Kinugawa, T},\n  date = {1996-08},\n  journaltitle = {Clinical and experimental pharmacology \\& physiology},\n  volume = {23},\n  number = {8},\n  eprint = {8886495},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {709--14},\n  issn = {0305-1870},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8886495},\n  urldate = {2019-05-27},\n  abstract = {1.

Activation of vagal afferents results in sympathoinhibitory, cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor responses.

These endings are more likely to be activated as the degree of ischaemia progresses from subendocardial towards transmural. They are evenly distributed between the anterior and inferoposterior wall. Although it has been suggested that these endings are activated by bradykinin, recent evidence indicates that they are activated by adenosine released from the ischaemic myocardium. Results from our laboratory indicate that this effect is due to the activation of adenosine A1, but not adenosine A2 receptors. 5.

We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health.

This study sought to define the effects of age and gender effects on the normal range of time domain heart rate variability (HRV) over nine decades in healthy subjects. Background. Low HRV is considered an independent marker of mortality risk. However, the age-related decline in HRV may limit its predictive value, particularly in the elderly. Delineation of the range of HRV in healthy subjects over the life span is needed. Gender- related differences in HRV also need clarification. Methods. We determined, according to decade, 24-h heart rate (HR) and HRV of 260 healthy subjects (10 to 99 years old; 112 male, 148 female) by means of five standard time domain measures: standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals over 24 h (SDNN), standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-mm segments (SDANN), mean of the standard deviations of all normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-min segments (SDNN index), root-mean-square of successive normal sinus RR interval difference (rMSSD) and the percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals {$>$}50 ms (pNN50). Results. 1) HRV decreased with aging, the pattern of change being measure dependent. HRV (SDNN and SDANN) decreased only very gradually, reaching 60\\% of baseline (second-decade values) by the tenth decade. With the SDNN index, HRV decreased linearly with aging, reaching 46\\% of baseline by the tenth decade. Using pNN50 and rMSSD, HRV decreased most rapidly, reaching 24\\% and 47\\% of baseline, respectively, by the sixth decade and then stabilized. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of subjects {$>$}65 years old fell below published cutpoints for increased risk of mortality in 25\\%, 12\\% and 4\\%, respectively. 3) At age {$<$}30 years, HRV for all measures was lower in female than male subjects. Gender differences decreased at age {$>$}30 years and disappeared at age {$>$}50 years. 4) HR also declined with aging but much more slowly. HR at age {$<$}50 years was faster in female than in male subjects. Gender differences disappeared thereafter. Conclusions. 1) Using all measures, HRV of healthy subjects declines with aging, with measure-dependent patterns. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of healthy subjects, particularly those {$>$}65 years old, may decrease to below levels associated with increased risk of mortality. 3)Gender influences HRV.

Because a functional relationship exists between cardiac autonomic effects and PVs in arrhythmogenesis, it has been suggested that discharges of the nerves that proceed to the PVs and interconnect with intrinsic ganglionated nerve plexuses are potential triggers of AF in man. Objective: This study sought to determine the characteristics and distribution of neural routes by which autonomic nerves supply the human PVs. Methods: We examined the intrinsic neural structures of 35 intact (nonsectioned) left atrial (LA)-PV complexes stained transmurally for acetylcholinesterase using a stereomicroscope. Results: The epicardial ganglionated nerves pass onto the extrapulmonary segments of the human PVs from the middle, left dorsal, and dorsal right atrial subplexuses. The left and right inferior PVs involved a lesser number of ganglia than the left and right superior PVs. Abundant extensions of epicardial nerves penetrate transmurally the PV walls and form a patchy neural network beneath the endothelium of PVs. The subendothelial neural meshwork with numerous free nerve endings, which appeared to be typical sensory compact nerve endings, was mostly situated at the roots of the 4 PVs. No ganglia were identified beneath the endothelium of the human PVs.

It has been suggested that day length or total hours of sunshine has an impact on suicide rates. If these environmental factors are involved, we would expect changes in the daily pattern of suicide rates to occur over the year. To test this hypothesis, the 24-h patterns of suicide rate were investigated as a function of time of year. Method: Detailed information about the exact time of suicides in The Netherlands is only available for train suicides. Therefore, information concerning age, sex, time and place of occurrence of all verified train suicides over 15 years in The Netherlands (n = 2830) was obtained from The Netherlands Railways archives. Results: Daily patterns in train suicides show systematic variations of two kinds. First, independently of time of year, suicide rates at night drop to about 10\\% of their daytime values. Second, there are two daily peaks in the patterns which shift their timing over the year, with one peak occurring shortly after sunset, and the other one consistently occurring 9-10 h earlier. Both peaks shift with the 5.5-h shift in sunset time. Limitations: Train suicidal behaviour may not represent fatal suicidal behaviour in general. Conclusions: There are pronounced and systematic daily variations in train suicide rates in The Netherlands. One of these is related to clock time, the others are related to the light-dark cycle. The consistency of the patterns suggests a strong environmental influence on train suicidal behaviour. Research on 24-h patterns of suicide rates should control for time of year. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the series of mechanisms of EADs leading to these ectopic beats and related cardiac arrhythmias are not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of this single cell behavior on the whole heart level. For this study we used a modified version of the Ten Tusscher-Panfilov model of human ventricular cells (TP06) which we implemented in a 3D ventricle model including realistic fiber orientations. To increase the likelihood of EAD formation at the single cell level, we reduced the repolarization reserve (RR) by reducing the rapid delayed rectifier Potassium current and raising the L-type Calcium current. Varying these parameters defined a 2D parametric space where different excitation patterns could be classified. Depending on the initial conditions, by either exciting the ventricles with a spiral formation or burst pacing protocol, we found multiple different spatio-temporal excitation patterns. The spiral formation protocol resulted in the categorization of a stable spiral (S), a meandering spiral (MS), a spiral break-up regime (SB), spiral fibrillation type B (B), spiral fibrillation type A (A) and an oscillatory excitation type (O). The last three patterns are a 3D generalization of previously found patterns in 2D. First, the spiral fibrillation type B showed waves determined by a chaotic bi-excitable regime, i.e. mediated by both Sodium and Calcium waves at the same time and in same tissue settings. In the parameter region governed by the B pattern, single cells were able to repolarize completely and different (spiral) waves chaotically burst into each other without finishing a 360 degree rotation. Second, spiral fibrillation type A patterns consisted of multiple small rotating spirals. Single cells failed to repolarize to the resting membrane potential hence prohibiting the Sodium channel gates to recover. Accordingly, we found that Calcium waves mediated these patterns. Third, a further reduction of the RR resulted in a more exotic parameter regime whereby the individual cells behaved independently as oscillators. The patterns arose due to a phase-shift of different oscillators as disconnection of the cells resulted in continuation of the patterns. For all patterns, we computed realistic 9 lead ECGs by including a torso model. The B and A type pattern exposed the behavior of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). We conclude that EADs at the single cell level can result in different types of cardiac fibrillation at the tissue and 3D ventricle level.},\n  isbn = {1111111111},\n  keywords = {Arrhythmia,Cardiac ventricles,Electrocardiography,Fourier analysis,Membrane potential,Rectifiers,Sodium channels,Wave propagation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/UIDAKSX3/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163222,"version":0},"$loki":830},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1245,"entry":"@article{Vaseghi2012,\n  title = {Sympathetic Innervation of the Anterior Left Ventricular Wall by the Right and Left Stellate Ganglia},\n  author = {Vaseghi, Marmar and Zhou, Wei and Shi, James and Ajijola, Olumiji A. and Hadaya, Joseph and Shivkumar, Kalyanam and Mahajan, Aman},\n  date = {2012-08},\n  journaltitle = {Heart Rhythm},\n  volume = {9},\n  number = {8},\n  pages = {1303--1309},\n  issn = {15475271},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.03.052},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1547527112002950},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  abstract = {Background: The sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a role in the genesis of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT).

However, the contribution of the right stellate ganglion (RSG) and the left stellate ganglion (LSG) to the innervation of the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall is not well understood. Objective: To evaluate the innervation of the anterior LV wall by the LSG and the RSG. Methods: The heart and stellate ganglia were exposed via sternotomy in pigs with normal hearts (n = 8). A 20-electrode catheter was placed on the anterior LV wall to record activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate measure of action potential duration. A microdialysis catheter was inserted in a similar location to sample interstitial norepinephrine (NE) content. ARI and NE measurements were recorded at baseline and during LSG and RSG stimulation. Results: LSG stimulation shortened ARI by 17.1\\% ± 10.5\\% (mean ± standard error), while RSG stimulation shortened ARI by 42.1\\% ± 15.7\\%, P =.04 (LSG vs RSG). LSG stimulation increased interstitial NE levels by 200\\% ± 65\\%, while RSG stimulation increased the NE content by 260\\% ± 40\\% (P =.012). LSG stimulation increased dispersion in ARI from 376.0 ± 83.7 ms2 to 1242.5 ± 566 ms2 (P =.03) and caused ventricular fibrillation in 2 pigs. During RSG stimulation, dispersion increased from 419 ± 65.8 to 474.8 ± 81 ms2 (P =.4). Conclusions: Both the LSG and the RSG provide significant innervation to the anterior LV wall as demonstrated by both ARI shortening and NE concentrations. LSG stimulation significantly increases ARI dispersion.

Disturbed Na and Ca handling is known to be a major predisposing factor for life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.

We have learned a lot about the pathophysiological relevance of disturbed ion channel function from monogenetic disorders. Changes in the gating of a single ion channel and the activity of an ion pump suffice to dramatically increase the propensity for arrhythmias even in structurally normal hearts. Nevertheless, patients with heart failure with acquired dysfunction in many ion channels and transporters exhibit profound dysregulation of Na and Ca handling and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and are especially prone to arrhythmias. A deeper understanding of the underlying arrhythmic principles is mandatory if we are to improve their outcome.

A recent study demonstrated that a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (ISO; 200 mg/kg) in mice causes acute myocyte death (8\\%-10\\%) with complete cardiac repair within a month. Cardiac regeneration was via endogenous cKit+ cardiac stem cell-mediated new myocyte formation. Objective: Our goal was to validate this simple injury/regeneration system and use it to study the biology of newly forming adult cardiac myocytes. Methods and Results: C57BL/6 mice (n=173) were treated with single injections of vehicle, 200 or 300 mg/kg ISO, or 2 daily doses of 200 mg/kg ISO for 6 days. Echocardiography revealed transiently increased systolic function and unaltered diastolic function 1 day after single ISO injection. Single ISO injections also caused membrane injury in ≈10\\% of myocytes, but few of these myocytes appeared to be necrotic. Circulating troponin I levels after ISO were elevated, further documenting myocyte damage. However, myocyte apoptosis was not increased after ISO injury. Heart weight to body weight ratio and fibrosis were also not altered 28 days after ISO injection. Single- or multiple-dose ISO injury was not associated with an increase in the percentage of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine-labeled myocytes. Furthermore, ISO injections did not increase new myocytes in cKit+/Cre×R-GFP transgenic mice. Conclusions: A single dose of ISO causes injury in ≈10\\% of the cardiomyocytes.

However, a potential contribution of the CSAR control of cardiac dysfunction in both normal and chronic heart failure (CHF) states remains unknown. We found that activation of the CSAR evokes little increase in cardiac contractility with an exaggerated peripheral vasoconstriction in the CHF state. CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine decreased cardiac contractility to a greater extent in CHF rats than sham rats. Furthermore, we also found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. Chronic ablation of the CSAR by epicardial application of the afferent neurotoxin, RTX, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure CHF rats. The observation suggests that CSAR has a differential effect on cardiac function in normal and CHF states. CSAR activation in normal state causes significant increase in cardiac contractility and cardiac output. ABSTRACT The enhanced 'cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex' (CSAR) critically contributes to the exaggerated global sympathetic tone in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, a potential contribution of the cardio-cardiac reflex control of cardiac function in both normal and CHF states remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of direct activation or inhibition of the CSAR on cardiac function by pressure-volume (P-V) loop analysis in ∼12-week sham-operated and myocardial infarcted (MI) rats. In sham rats, acute CSAR activation by epicardial application of bradykinin (BK) increased heart rate (HR), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dtmax ), and the slope of the end-systolic P-V relationship (ESPVR), suggesting that acute CSAR activation in the normal state enhances myocardial contractility. CSAR activation also decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic volumes with little effect on LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or the end-diastolic P-V relationship (EDPVR) in sham rats. Compared to sham, CHF rats exhibit a reduced increase in the slope of the ESPVR and dp/dtmax in response to BK, indicating a poor contractile response to CSAR activation. Interestingly, BK application in CHF rats increased cardiac systolic and diastolic volumes and further increased the elevated LVEDP, neither of which was seen in sham rats. Following CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine, blood pressure, HR, LVSP, dp/dt, LVEDP and ESPVR decreased in CHF rats whereas lidocaine had little effect in sham rats, indicating that the CSAR is tonically active in CHF and contributes to cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased LV end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. The decreased preload by lidocaine in CHF rats may be due to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance since epicardial lidocaine significantly lowered peripheral (renal) sympathetic nerve activity in CHF rats but not in sham rats. Furthermore, chronic ablation of CSAR by epicardial application of a selective afferent neurotoxin, resiniferatoxin, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure both at daytime and night-time with less effect on systolic blood pressure in CHF rats. Our data suggest that there is an imbalance between cardiac and peripheral responses to CSAR in CHF animals compared to sham-operated controls.},\n  keywords = {autonomic dysfunction,cardiac dysfunction,cardiovascular reflexes,sympathetic nerve activity},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/FUGI7YV6/m-api-131b6ff9-168a-6357-2ec8-1ce13c50efcd.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163254,"version":0},"$loki":838},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1461,"entry":"@article{Wang2018,\n  title = {Obstructive Sleep Apnea Is Associated with Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia in Patients with Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy},\n  author = {Wang, Shuiyun Shengwei and Cui, Hao and Song, Changpeng and Zhu, Changsheng and Wu, Rong and Meng, Liukun and Yu, Qinjun and Huang, Xiaohong and Wang, Shuiyun Shengwei},\n  date = {2018-12-18},\n  journaltitle = {Heart Rhythm},\n  eprint = {30576881},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  issn = {1556-3871},\n  doi = {S1547527118312839},\n  url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527118312839?dgcid=rss_sd_all},\n  urldate = {2019-01-28},\n  abstract = {Publication date: Available online 18 December 2018 Source: Heart Rhythm Author(s): Shengwei Wang, Hao Cui, Changpeng Song, Changsheng Zhu, Rong Wu, Liukun Meng, Qinjun Yu, Xiaohong Huang, Shuiyun Wang Abstract Background Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with arrhythmias and cardiovascular death. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent and independently associated with atrial fibrillation among patients with HCM. Objective To determine the relationship between non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and OSA in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Methods One hundred thirty consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HOCM in Fuwai Hospital between September 2017 and May 2018 were included. Polysomnography and Holter electrocardiography were performed in all patients. Results Of 130 patients, 72 (55.4\\%) were diagnosed with OSA, including 38 with mild, 21 with moderate, and 13 with severe OSA, and 27 (20.8\\%) patients had NSVT. The prevalence of NSVT increased with the severity of OSA (none, mild, moderate, and severe: 12.1\\%, 15.8\\%, 33.3\\%, and 53.8\\%, respectively; p for trend Conclusion The presence and severity of OSA in patients with HOCM is independently associated with NSVT, which is a risk factor for SCD and cardiovascular death in this population.},\n  keywords = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia,Obstructive sleep apnea,Supraventricular tachycardia,Ventricular arrhythmias}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708163257,"version":0},"$loki":839},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1106,"entry":"@article{WEITZMAN1971,\n  title = {Twenty-Four Hour Pattern of the Episodic Secretion of Cortisol in Normal Subjects},\n  author = {Weitzman, Elliot D. and Fukushima, David and Nogeire, Christopher and Roffwarg, Howard and Gallagher, T.

Currently there is no description of an in vitro whole heart preparation for comparing the influence of each sympathetic supply on cardiac function. The aim was to establish the viability of using an in vitro model to investigate the effects of left and right sympathetic chain stimulation (LSS/RSS). For this purpose the upper sympathetic chain on each side was isolated and bipolar stimulating electrodes were attached between T2-T3 and electrically insulated from surrounding tissue in a Langendorff innervated rabbit heart preparation (n = 8). Heart rate (HR) was investigated during sinus rhythm, whilst dromotropic, inotropic and ventricular electrophysiological effects were measured during constant pacing (250. bpm). All responses exhibited linear increases with increases in stimulation frequency (2-10. Hz). The change in HR was larger during RSS than LSS (P. {$<$}. 0.01), increasing by 78. ±. 9. bpm and 49. ±. 8. bpm respectively (10. Hz, baseline; 145. ±. 7. bpm). Left ventricular pressure was increased from a baseline of 50. ±. 4. mm. Hg, by 22. ±. 5. mm. Hg (LSS, 10. Hz) and 4. ±. 1. mm. Hg (RSS, 10. Hz) respectively (P. {$<$}. 0.001). LSS, but not RSS, caused a shortening of basal and apical monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90). We demonstrate that RSS exerts a greater effect at the sinoatrial node and LSS at the left ventricle.

DESIGN AND METHODS One hundred eighteen healthy young women provided data on ACEs and underwent psychosocial stress testing. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, quantified by high-frequency HR variability) were assessed as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. A mediation model was calculated to test the indirect effects of ACEs on HR via SBP and RSA. RESULTS The effect of ACEs on HR reactivity was mediated by SBP reactivity but not by RSA reactivity. ACEs were associated with reduced SBP at rest.

Early recognition of low left ventricular ejection fraction as a strong predictor of death and association of ventricular arrhythmias with sudden death led to significant investigation with antiarrhythmic drugs.

SN ablation caused an immediate reduction in the cardiomyocyte size with minimal consequences on the resting contractile function. Atrophic remodelling was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through FOXO-dependent early induction of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1, which was followed by activation of the autophagy-lysosome system. MuRF1 was found to be determinant in denervation atrophy as remodelling did not develop in denervated MuRF1 knock-out (KO) hearts. These effects were caused by decreased basal stimulation of cardiomyocyte β2-adrenoceptor (AR), as atrophy was prevented by treatment of denervated mice with the β2-AR agonist clenbuterol. Consistent with these data, we also observed that β2-AR KO mice showed cardiac atrophy at rest.\\textbackslash n\\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Cardiac SNs are strong regulators of the cardiomyocyte size via β2-AR-dependent repression of proteolysis, demonstrating that the neuro-cardiac axis operates constitutively for the determination of the physiological cardiomyocyte size.

However, evidence indicates that the neurogenic control of the heart spans from the maintenance of housekeeping functions in resting conditions to the recruitment of maximal performance, in the fight-or-flight responses, across a whole range of intermediate states. To perform such sophisticated functions, sympathetic ganglia integrate both peripheral and central inputs, and transmit information to the heart via 'motor' neurons, directly interacting with target cardiomyocytes.

Her research focuses on the role of cardiac sympathetic innervation in the regulation of cardiomyocyte structure through modulation of intracellular proteostasis. She has discovered how cardiac sympathetic innervation regulates cardiac mass, and identified how alterations in cardiac proteostasis lead to cardiomyopathy. Her research uses in vitro and in vivo models, with various techniques from cellular biochemistry and signalling, to organ physiology. To train her cardiac sympathetic neurons, she works out at the gym. Marco Mongillo, MD, PhD, coordinates the Molecular Cardiology lab at the VIMM, and his main research interests are centred on the intercellular communication of sympathetic neurons with their myocardial cellular targets. He developed and uses novel tools to explore second messenger signalling, using confocal and multiphoton microscopy, electrophysiology and optogenetics, both in cellular models and in vivo.

The ratio of time velocity integrals of the early (Ei) to late (Ai) waves increased from 1.07±0.12 to 1.65±0.17 after VNS (p{$<$}0.05). In electrocardiograms of VNS-treated patients, QRS- and QT-duration were shortened, the PQ-interval did not change, but T-wave configuration improved. In the postoperative period, heart failure occurred in 90\\% of the control group, vs. 12\\% in patients treated with VNS (p{$<$}0.05). We conclude that CAD is characterized by overactivity of sympathetic cardiac tone. Vagal stimulation reduced sympathetic inflow to the heart, seemingly via an inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. VNS' sympatholytic/vagotonic action dilated cardiac microcirculatory vessels and improved left ventricular contractility in patients with severe CAD.

Precise points of entry of parasympathetic nerves to the sinus and AV nodal regions have recently been described.3 On the right, vagal input to the superior atrial and sinus nodal regions is by neural projections along the superior vena cava-right atrial junction, azygos vein, right pulmonary vein complex, and dorsal surfaces of the common pulmonary vein complex.

While most HAVB occurs within 48 hours of the procedure, there is a growing number of patients developing HAVB after initial hospitalisation for TAVR due to the trend for early discharge from hospital.

Over the last few decades, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) has been established as a lower-cost alternative treatment for mitral stenosis (MS) in low-to-middle-income countries. PBMV has also been suggested to be an effective and safe alternative treatment modality. This study aims to analyse the survival of rheumatic MS patients treated with PBMV compared with those treated with mitral valve surgery (MVS). Methods: This study was a national, single-centre, longitudinal study using a survival analysis method in 329 consecutive patients suffering from rheumatic heart disease with severe MS who underwent PBMV compared with 142 consecutive patients with similar characteristics who underwent MVS between January 2011 and December 2016. Survival analysis and event-free duration were determined over a median follow-up of 24 months in the PBMV group and 27 months in the MVS group. Results: The results showed that of the 329 consecutive patients in the PBMV group, 61 patients (18.5) had an event (6 patients died and 55 patients were hospitalised), and of the 142 consecutive patients in the MVS group, 19 patients (13.4\\%) had an event (5 patients died, and 14 patients were hospitalised).

Trial-eligible arrhythmias were the categories of VF cardiac arrest; Syncopal VT, and Symptomatic VT, below. Methods and Results-Of 5989 patients screened, 4595 were registered and 1016 were randomized. Mortality follow-up through 1996 was obtained on the 4219 Registry patients enrolled before 1997 through the National Death Index. Crude mortality rates (mean±SD, follow-up, 16.9±11.5 months) were: VF cardiac arrest, 17.0\\% (n=1399, 238 deaths); Syncopal VT, 21.2\\% (n=598, 127 deaths); Symptomatic VT, 15.8\\% (n= 1065, 168 deaths); Stable (asymptomatic) VT, 19.7\\% (n=497, 98 deaths); VT/VF with transient/correctable cause, 17.8\\% (n=270, 48 deaths); and Unexplained syncope, 12.3\\% (n=390, 48 deaths).

The similar (and poor) prognosis of most patients with VT/VF suggests the need for reevaluation of a priori risk grouping and raises the question of the appropriate arrhythmia therapy for a broad range of patients.},\n  keywords = {Antiarrhythmia agents,Death,Fibrillation,Registries,sudden,Tachycardia},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/57QQV8L6/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173154,"version":0},"$loki":864},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2159,"entry":"@article{Ando2018,\n  title = {Concomitant Surgical Closure of Left Atrial Appendage: {{A}} Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},\n  author = {Ando, Masahiko and Funamoto, Masaki and Cameron, Duke E. and Sundt, Thoralf M.},\n  date = {2018-09-01},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery},\n  volume = {156},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {29628346},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1071-1080.e2},\n  publisher = {{Mosby Inc.}},\n  issn = {1097685X},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.03.017},\n  abstract = {Objectives: Although percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage is supported as a potential alternative to lifelong anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation, comprehensive evidence on surgical left atrial appendage closure in heart surgery is limited. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing patients who underwent open cardiac surgery with or without left atrial appendage closure. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Trials databases. Outcomes of interest were 30-day/in-hospital mortality and cerebrovascular accident. I2 statistics were used to evaluate heterogeneity, and publication bias was evaluated by Begg's and Egger's tests. Results: We reviewed 1284 articles and selected for main analysis 7 articles including 3897 patients (1963 in the left atrial appendage closure group and 1934 in the non–left atrial appendage closure group). Among the 7 studies, 3 were randomized-controlled studies, 3 were propensity-matched studies, and 1 was a case-matching study. At 30-day/in-hospital follow-up, left atrial appendage closure was significantly associated with decreased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular accident (odds ratio, 0.384, 95\\% confidence interval, 0.233-0.631 for mortality, and odds ratio, 0.622, 95\\% confidence interval, 0.388-0.998 for cerebrovascular accident). Stratified analysis demonstrated that this association was more prominent in preoperative atrial fibrillation strata. Conclusions: Concomitant surgical left atrial appendage closure should be considered at the time of open cardiac surgery, particularly among those in atrial fibrillation preoperatively.

Amplification of this spatial dispersion of repolarization (SDR) underlies the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with inherited or acquired ion channelopathies giving rise to the long QT, short QT and Brugada syndromes (BrS). This review focuses on the role of spatial dispersion of repolarization in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis associated with the long QT and BrS. In the long QT syndrome, drug-induced amplification of SDR is often secondary to preferential prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) of M cells, whereas in the BrS, it is thought to be due to selective abbreviation of the APD of right ventricular epicardium. Among the challenges ahead is the identification of a means to quantitate SDR non-invasively. This review also discusses the value of the interval between the peak and end of the T wave (Tpeak-Tend, Tp-Te) as an index of SDR and transmural dispersion of repolarization, in particular.

This article aims to systematically review the evidence for EI in medicine through the context of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for English-language articles published between January 1980 and March 2009. The grey literature was also searched and experts in the field contacted for additional studies. Two independent reviewers selected articles which reported empirical research studies about clinicians or medical students. Conceptual articles and opinion pieces and commentaries were excluded. Information about the measure used to assess EI, the study parameter or domain, and the educational or clinical outcome (with specific relation to the ACGME competencies) was extracted. RESULTS: The literature search identified 485 citations. An abstract review led to the retrieval of 24 articles for full-text assessment, of which 16 articles were included in the final review. Eleven studies focused on postgraduates, four on undergraduates and one on medical school applicants. Six out of seven studies found women to have higher EI than men. Higher EI was reported to positively contribute to the doctor-patient relationship (three studies), increased empathy (five studies), teamwork and communication skills (six studies), and stress management, organisational commitment and leadership (three studies). CONCLUSIONS: Measures of EI correlate with many of the competencies that modern medical curricula seek to deliver.

Because lesions due to radiofrequency (RF) current are small and well defined, it may allow precise localization of accessory pathways. The purpose of this study was to use RF catheter ablation to develop an ECG algorithm to predict accessory pathway location. Methods and Results: An algorithm was developed by correlating a resting 12-lead ECG with the successful RF ablation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single, anterogradely conducting accessory pathway (Retrospective phase). This algorithm was subsequently tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients (Prospective phase). The ECG findings included the initial 20 msec of the delta wave in leads I, II, aVF, and V1 [classified as positive (+), negative (-), or isoelectric (±)] and the ratio of R and S wave amplitudes in leads III and V1 (classified as R ≤ S or R {$<$} S). When tested prospectively, the ECG algorithm accurately localized the accessory pathway to 1 of 10 sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli or at subepicardial locations within the venous system of the heart. Overall sensitivity was 90\\% and specificity was 99\\%. The algorithm was particularly useful in correctly localizing anteroseptal (sensitivity 75\\%, specificity 99\\%), and mid-septal (sensitivity 100\\%, specificity 98\\%) accessory pathways as well as pathways requiring ablation from within ventricular venous branches or anomalies of the coronary sinus (sensitivity 100\\%, specificity 100\\%). Conclusion: A simple ECG algorithm identifies accessory pathway ablation site in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A truly negative delta wave in lead II predicts ablation within the coronary venous system.},\n  keywords = {Accessory pathway,Electrocardiogram,Radiofrequency catheter ablation,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/IRZF46XS/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173189,"version":0},"$loki":868},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":58,"entry":"@article{Baile2000,\n  title = {{{SPIKES--A Six-Step Protocol}} for {{Delivering Bad News}}: {{Application}} to the {{Patient}} with {{Cancer}}},\n  author = {Baile, W F},\n  date = {2000-08-01},\n  journaltitle = {The Oncologist},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {10964998},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {302--311},\n  publisher = {{AlphaMed Press}},\n  issn = {1083-7159},\n  doi = {10.1634/theoncologist.5-4-302},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10964998},\n  urldate = {2018-03-12},\n  abstract = {We describe a protocol for disclosing unfavorable information-\"breaking bad news\"-to cancer patients about their illness.

Treatment with amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proposed to improve the prognosis in such patients. METHODS We randomly assigned 2521 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III CHF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35 percent or less to conventional therapy for CHF plus placebo (847 patients), conventional therapy plus amiodarone (845 patients), or conventional therapy plus a conservatively programmed, shock-only, single-lead ICD (829 patients). Placebo and amiodarone were administered in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was death from any cause. RESULTS The median LVEF in patients was 25 percent; 70 percent were in NYHA class II, and 30 percent were in class III CHF. The cause of CHF was ischemic in 52 percent and nonischemic in 48 percent. The median follow-up was 45.5 months. There were 244 deaths (29 percent) in the placebo group, 240 (28 percent) in the amiodarone group, and 182 (22 percent) in the ICD group. As compared with placebo, amiodarone was associated with a similar risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.06; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P=0.53) and ICD therapy was associated with a decreased risk of death of 23 percent (0.77; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.007) and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population. Results did not vary according to either ischemic or nonischemic causes of CHF, but they did vary according to the NYHA class.

The idea that right atrial pressure is a back pressure limiting cardiac output and the associated idea that \"venous recoil\" does work to produce flow have confused physiologists and clinicians for decades because Guyton's interpretation interchanges independent and dependent variables. Here Guyton's model and data are reanalyzed to clarify the role of arterial and right atrial pressures and cardiac output and to clearly delineate that cardiac output is the independent (causal) variable in the experiments. Guyton's original mathematical model is used with his data to show that a simultaneous increase in arterial pressure and decrease in right atrial pressure with increasing cardiac output is due to a blood volume shift into the systemic arterial circulation from the systemic venous circulation. This is because Guyton's model assumes a constant blood volume in the systemic circulation. The increase in right atrial pressure observed when cardiac output decreases in a closed circulation with constant resistance and capacitance is due to the redistribution of blood volume and not because right atrial pressure limits venous return.

We evaluated the effect on survival of the prophylactic implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators in such patients at the time of coronary-artery bypass surgery. METHODS Over the course of five years, 37 clinical centers screened all patients who were scheduled for elective coronary bypass surgery. Patients were eligible for the trial if they were less than 80 years old, had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 0.36, and had abnormalities on signal-averaged electrocardiograms. We identified 1422 eligible patients, enrolled 1055, and randomly assigned 900 to therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (446 patients) or to the control group (454 patients). The primary end point of the study was overall mortality, and the two groups were compared in an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS The base-line characteristics of the two groups were similar. During an average follow-up of 32+/-16 months, there were 101 deaths in the defibrillator group (71 from cardiac causes) and 95 in the control group (72 from cardiac causes).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Comprehensive mutation analysis of the 8 HCM susceptibility genes that encode the myofilaments of the cardiac sarcomere was performed previously in 382 unrelated patients with HCM. Blinded to genotype status, we used echocardiography to characterize the left ventricular morphological features. Multivariate regression was used to assess the relationship among morphological subtypes, clinical data, and genetic variables. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD age of the patients was 41.6+/-19.0 years, with 126 patients 50 years or older at initial diagnosis. The septal morphological subtype was sigmold in 181 (47\\%), reverse in 132 (35\\%), apical variant in 37 (10\\%), and neutral in 32 (8\\%). The HCM-associated myofilament mutations were Identified in 143 patients (37\\%). Multivariate analysis showed that the reverse curvature septal morphological subtype was a strong predictor of genotype-positive status (odds ratio, 21; P{$<$}.001). Overall, the yield of HCM genetic testing was 79\\% in the setting of reverse curvature HCM but only 8\\% in sigmold septal HCM. CONCLUSION: In stark contrast to HCM in young patients, elderly patients with HCM display a predominantly sigmoid septal morphological subtype and uncommonly have perturbations of known HCM susceptibility genes. Independent of age, septal morphological subtype strongly predicts the presence or absence of HCM-associated myofilament mutations and may enable echocardiography-guided genetic testing for HCM.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Actin Cytoskeleton,Adult,Aged,{Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic},DNA Mutational Analysis,Echocardiography,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Genotype,Heart Septum,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Mutation,Observer Variation,Odds Ratio,Retrospective Studies}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173251,"version":0},"$loki":875},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":72,"entry":"@article{Bordley2010,\n  title = {Competency-Based {{Advancement}}: {{Risky Business}}},\n  author = {Bordley, Donald R. and Smith, Lawrence G. and Wiese, Jeffrey G.},\n  date = {2010-02-01},\n  journaltitle = {American Journal of Medicine},\n  volume = {123},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {20103033},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {188--191},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}},\n  issn = {00029343},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.07.029},\n  url = {http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002934309010092},\n  urldate = {2018-03-14},\n  isbn = {1555-7162 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0002-9343 (Linking)},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/BVP8KJVE/2010_Bordley, Smith, Wiese_Competency-based Advancement Risky Business.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173253,"version":0},"$loki":876},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1690,"entry":"@article{Borlaug2009,\n  title = {Invasive {{Hemodynamic Assessment}} in {{Heart Failure}}},\n  author = {Borlaug, Barry A. and Kass, David A.},\n  date = {2009-04},\n  journaltitle = {Heart Failure Clinics},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {19249690},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {217--228},\n  publisher = {{NIH Public Access}},\n  issn = {15517136},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.hfc.2008.11.008},\n  url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680766/},\n  urldate = {2020-09-21},\n  abstract = {Routine cardiac catheterization provides data on left heart, right heart, systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, vascular resistances, cardiac output, and ejection fraction.

In 18 echocardiography studies (2,566 AF patients), 2 studies showed high external validity of global longitudinal strain and tissue Doppler s’ with angiography-derived dP/dt (r ≥0.88). Global longitudinal strain and myocardial performance index were both associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Reproducibility of echocardiography was better when selecting an index-beat (where 2 preceding R-to-R intervals are similar) compared to averaging of consecutive beats. There were no studies relating to computed tomography. Most studies were small and biased by selection of patients with good quality images, limiting clinical extrapolation of results.

The challenge of meaningful assessment of learner competence has stimulated interest in the Dreyfus and Dreyfus Model, a framework for assessing skill acquisition that describes developmental stages beginning with novice and progressing through advanced beginner, competent, proficient, expert, and master. Many educators have adopted this model, but no consensus about its adaptation to clinical medicine has been documented. In this article, the authors seek to integrate generally accepted knowledge and beliefs about how one learns to practice clinical medicine into a coherent developmental framework using the Dreyfus and Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. Using the general domain of patient care, the characteristics and skills of learners at each stage of development are translated into typical behaviors. A tangible picture of this model in real-world practice is provided through snapshots of typical learner performance at discrete moments in time along the developmental continuum. The Dreyfus and Dreyfus model is discussed in the context of other developmental models of assessment of learner competence. The limitations of the model, in particular the controversy around the behaviors of \"experts,\" are discussed in light of other interpretations of expertise in the literature. Support for descriptive developmental models of assessment is presented in the context of a discussion of the deconstructing versus reconstructing of competencies.},\n  isbn = {1938-808X (Electronic)\\textbackslash r1040-2446 (Linking)}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173280,"version":0},"$loki":880},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1086,"entry":"@article{Chaitman1981b,\n  title = {Angiographic Prevalence of High-Risk Coronary Artery Disease in Patient Subsets ({{CASS}})},\n  author = {Chaitman, Bernard R and Bourassa, M.

The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) terminates VT or VF, but it is not known whether this device prolongs life in these patients compared with medical therapy with amiodarone. Methods and Results - A total of 659 patients with resuscitated VF or VT or with unmonitored syncope were randomly assigned to treatment with the ICD or with amiodarone. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was arrhythmic death. A total of 328 patients were randomized to receive an ICD. A thoracotomy was done in 33, no ICD was implanted in 18, and the rest had a nonthoracotomy ICD. All 331 patients randomized to amiodarone received it initially.

The present analysis was performed to obtain the most precise estimate of the efficacy of the ICD, compared to amiodarone, for prolonging survival in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Methods and Results: Individual patient data from the Antiarrhythmics vs Implantable Defibrillator (AVID) study, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH) and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) were merged into a master database according to a pre-specified protocol. Proportional hazard modelling of individual patient data was used to estimate hazard ratios and to investigate subgroup interactions. Fixed effect meta-analysis techniques were also used to evaluate treatment effects and to assess heterogeneity across studies. The classic fixed effects meta-analysis showed that the estimates of ICD benefit from the three studies were consistent with each other (P heterogeneity=0.306). It also showed a significant reduction in death from any cause with the ICD; with a summary hazard ratio (ICD:amiodarone) of 0.72 (95\\% confidence interval 0.60, 0.87; P=0.0006). For the outcome of arrhythmic death, the hazard ratio was 0.50 (95\\% confidence interval 0.37, 0.67; P{$<$}0.0001). Survival was extended by a mean of 4.4 months by the ICD over a follow-up period of 6 years. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥35\\% derived significantly more benefit from ICD therapy than those with better preserved left ventricular function. Patients treated before the availability of non-thoracotomy ICD implants derived significantly less benefit from ICD therapy than those treated in the non-thoracotomy era.

Prolonged heart rate-corrected QT interval is associated with higher risk of mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and in the general population. However, the QTc is typically not evaluated when QRS duration is {$>$} or =120 ms, because increased QRS duration (QRSd) contributes to QT interval prolongation. In these circumstances, the JT interval has been proposed as a more valid way to assess ventricular repolarization. METHODS AND RESULTS: To allow for variation in heart rate, corrected JT interval (JTc) was defined as QTc-QRSd. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, JTc and QTc were compared for their prognostic associations with incident CHD events among 14 696 men and women who were CHD-free at baseline, having either normal conduction or wide QRS complex. Among individuals with normal QRS duration, logistic regression adjusted for age, hypertensive status, diabetes, race, systolic blood pressure, smoking, HDL and LDL cholesterol, R-R interval, and menopausal status in women showed QTc and JTc were nonpredictive of future coronary events in men but significant in women. In individuals with wide QRS complex (QRSd {$>$} or =120 ms), similar analyses showed JTc had a significant prognostic advantage compared with QTc in men but not in women, among whom only 11 events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The JTc is a simple measurement that is a significant independent predictor of incident CHD events in men with wide QRS complex.},\n  isbn = {1524-4539 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0009-7322 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Bundle-branch block,Electrocardiography,Prognosis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/6V4DK4JZ/2003-qtc-jtc-intervals.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173326,"version":0},"$loki":886},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2174,"entry":"@article{Curtis2013,\n  title = {Biventricular {{Pacing}} for {{Atrioventricular Block}} and {{Systolic Dysfunction}}},\n  author = {Curtis, Anne B. and Worley, Seth J. and Adamson, Philip B. and Chung, Eugene S. and Niazi, Imran and Sherfesee, Lou and Shinn, Timothy and St. John Sutton, Martin},\n  date = {2013-04-25},\n  journaltitle = {New England Journal of Medicine},\n  volume = {368},\n  number = {17},\n  pages = {1585--1593},\n  issn = {0028-4793},\n  doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa1210356}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173330,"version":0},"$loki":887},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1894,"entry":"@article{Davis2020,\n  title = {Peripartum {{Cardiomyopathy}}: {{JACC State-of-the-Art Review}}},\n  author = {Davis, Melinda B. and Arany, Zolt and McNamara, Dennis M. and Goland, Sorel and Elkayam, Uri},\n  date = {2020-01-21},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American College of Cardiology},\n  volume = {75},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {31948651},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {207--221},\n  publisher = {{NLM (Medline)}},\n  issn = {15583597},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2019.11.014},\n  abstract = {Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of systolic heart failure affecting young women toward the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery.

METHODS We randomly assigned 63 internal medicine residency programs in the United States to be governed by standard duty-hour policies of the 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or by more flexible policies that did not specify limits on shift length or mandatory time off between shifts. Measures of educational experience included observations of the activities of interns (first-year residents), surveys of trainees (both interns and residents) and faculty, and intern examination scores. RESULTS There were no significant between-group differences in the mean percentages of time that interns spent in direct patient care and education nor in trainees’ perceptions of an appropriate balance between clinical demands and education (primary outcome for trainee satisfaction with education; response rate, 91\\%) or in the assessments by program directors and faculty of whether trainees’ workload exceeded their capacity (primary outcome for faculty satisfaction with education; response rate, 90\\%). Another survey of interns (response rate, 49\\%) revealed that those in flexible programs were more likely to report dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of training, including educational quality (odds ratio, 1.67; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.73) and overall well-being (odds ratio, 2.47; 95\\% CI, 1.67 to 3.65). In contrast, directors of flexible programs were less likely to report dissatisfaction with multiple educational processes, including time for bedside teaching (response rate, 98\\%; odds ratio, 0.13; 95\\% CI, 0.03 to 0.49). Average scores (percent correct answers) on in-training examinations were 68.9\\% in flexible programs and 69.4\\% in standard programs; the difference did not meet the noninferiority margin of 2 percentage points (difference, −0.43; 95\\% CI, −2.38 to 1.52; P=0.06 for noninferiority). CONCLUSIONS There was no significant difference in the proportion of time that medical interns spent on direct patient care and education between programs with standard duty-hour policies and programs with more flexible policies. Interns in flexible programs were less satisfied with their educational experience than were their peers in standard programs, but program directors were more satisfied.

As a result, many educational organizations are calling for reforms in inpatient training. This report reviews the available literature on specific internal medicine inpatient educational interventions and proposes recommendations for improving internal medicine training in this setting. METHOD We searched Medline for articles published between 1966 and August 2004 which focused on internal medicine training interventions in the inpatient setting; bibliographies of Medline-identified articles, as well as articles suggested by experts in the field provided additional citations. We then reviewed, classified, and abstracted only articles where an assessment of learner outcomes was included. RESULTS Thirteen studies of inpatient internal medicine educational interventions were found that included an outcome assessment. All were single institution studies. The majority of these studies was of poor methodological quality and focused on specific content areas of internal medicine. None assessed the effectiveness or impact of internal medicine core inpatient experiences or curriculum. CONCLUSION This review identifies significant gaps in our understanding of what constitutes effective inpatient education. The paucity of high quality research in the internal medicine inpatient setting highlights the urgent need to formally define and study what constitutes an effective \"core\" inpatient curriculum.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/2PST2XWE/2005_Di Francesco et al._Internal medicine training in the inpatient setting.

Background CMR is increasingly used to investigate patients with suspected amyloidosis. Global subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has been reported as typical of AL amyloidosis, whereas different patterns have been noted in ATTR amyloidosis. Methods We performed de novo analyses on original DICOM magnetic resonance imaging in 46 patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis and 51 patients with ATTR type who had been referred to a specialist amyloidosis center between 2007 and 2012 after CMR. Histological examination was performed in all cases, with immunohistochemistry, to confirm systemic amyloidosis. Results Patients' median age was 68 ± 10 years, and 74\\% were male. Left ventricular mass was markedly increased in ATTR amyloidosis (228 g [202 to 267 g]) compared with AL type (167 g [137 to 191 g]) (p {$<$} 0.001). LGE was detected in all but 1 cardiac amyloidosis patient (AL type) and was substantially more extensive in ATTR compared with AL amyloidosis. Ninety percent of ATTR patients demonstrated transmural LGE compared with 37\\% of AL patients (p {$<$} 0.001). Right ventricular LGE was apparent in all ATTR patients but in only 33 AL patients (72\\%) (p {$<$} 0.001). Despite these findings, survival was significantly better in cardiac ATTR amyloidosis compared with AL type. We derived an LGE scoring system (Query Amyloid Late Enhancement) that independently differentiated ATTR from AL amyloidosis and, when incorporated into a logistic regression model with age and wall thickness, detected ATTR type with 87\\% sensitivity and 96\\% specificity. Conclusions Transmural patterns of LGE distinguished ATTR from AL cardiac amyloidosis with high accuracy in this real-world analysis of CMR. Precise diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is crucial given the role of chemotherapy in AL type and with novel therapies for ATTR type currently in development.},\n  keywords = {amyloid,cardiomyopathy,magnetic resonance imaging},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/PIYDPVM8/2014-cmr-amyloidosis-differentiation.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173399,"version":0},"$loki":895},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1848,"entry":"@article{Dunning2017,\n  title = {The {{Society}} of {{Thoracic Surgeons Expert Consensus}} for the {{Resuscitation}} of {{Patients Who Arrest After Cardiac Surgery}}},\n  author = {Dunning, Joel and Levine, Adrian and Ley, Jill and Strang, Tim and Lizotte, David E. and Lamarche, Yoan and Bartley, Tara and Zellinger, Mary and Katz, Nevin and Arora, Rakesh C and Dembitsky, Walter and Cheng, Aaron M and Lonchyna, Vassy A and Haft, Jonathan and Deakin, Charles D. and Mitchell, John D and Firestone, Scott and Bakaeen, Faisal G},\n  date = {2017},\n  journaltitle = {Annals of Thoracic Surgery},\n  volume = {103},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {28122680},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1005--1020},\n  issn = {15526259},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.10.033},\n  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.10.033},\n  urldate = {2021-10-18},\n  abstract = {Executive Summary The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Task Force on Resuscitation After Cardiac Surgery provides this professional society perspective on resuscitation in patients who arrest after cardiac surgery. This document was created using a multimodal methodology for evidence generation and includes information from existing guidelines, from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, from our own structured literature reviews on issues particular to cardiac surgery, and from an international survey on resuscitation hosted by CTSNet. In gathering evidence for this consensus paper, searches were conducted using the MEDLINE keywords “cardiac surgery,” “resuscitation,” “guideline,” “thoracic surgery,” “cardiac arrest,” and “cardiac massage.” Weight was given to clinical studies in humans, although some case studies, mannequin simulations of potential protocols, and animal models were also considered. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method consisting of two rounds of voting until 75\\% agreement on appropriate wording and strength of the opinions was reached. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Workforce on Critical Care was enlisted in this process to provide a wider variety of experiences and backgrounds in an effort to reinforce the opinions provided. We start with the premise that external massage is ineffective for an arrest due to tamponade or hypovolemia (bleeding), and therefore these subsets of patients will receive inadequate cerebral perfusion during cardiac arrest in the absence of resternotomy. Because these two situations are common causes for an arrest after cardiac surgery, the inability to provide effective external cardiopulmonary resuscitation highlights the importance of early emergency resternotomy within 5 minutes. In addition, because internal massage is more effective than external massage, it should be used preferentially if other quickly reversible causes are not found. We present a protocol for the cardiac arrest situation that includes the following recommendations: (1) successful treatment of a patient who arrests after cardiac surgery is a multidisciplinary activity with at least six key roles that should be allocated and rehearsed as a team on a regular basis; (2) patients who arrest with ventricular fibrillation should immediately receive three sequential attempts at defibrillation before external cardiac massage, and if this fails, emergency resternotomy should be performed; (3) patients with asystole or extreme bradycardia should undergo an attempt to pace if wires are available before external cardiac massage, then optionally external pacing followed by emergency resternotomy; and (4) pulseless electrical activity should receive prompt resternotomy after quickly reversible causes are excluded. Finally, we recommend that full doses of epinephrine should not be routinely given owing to the danger of extreme hypertension if a reversible cause is rapidly resolved. Protocols are given for excluding reversible airway and breathing complications, for left ventricular assist device emergencies, for the nonsternotomy patient, and for safe emergency resternotomy. We believe that all cardiac units should have accredited policies and protocols in place to specifically address the resuscitation of patients who arrest after cardiac surgery.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/MMLUK8EQ/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173405,"version":0},"$loki":896},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":572,"entry":"@article{Elizari2007,\n  title = {Hemiblocks Revisited},\n  author = {Elizari, Marcelo V and Acunzo, Rafael S and Ferreiro, Marcela},\n  date = {2007},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation},\n  volume = {115},\n  number = {9},\n  eprint = {17339573},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1154--1163},\n  issn = {00097322},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.637389},\n  url = {http://www.circulationaha.org},\n  urldate = {2019-02-20},\n  abstract = {The trifascicular nature of the intraventricular conduction system and the concept of trifascicular block and hemiblock were described by Rosenbaum and his coworkers in 1968. Since then, anatomic, pathological, electrophysiological, and clinical studies have confirmed the original description and scarce advances have been developed on the subject. In the present study, we attempt to review and redefine reliable criteria for the electrocardiographic and vectorcardiographic diagnosis of left anterior and posterior hemiblock. One of the most important problems related to hemiblocks is that they may simulate or conceal the electrocardiographic signs of myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia and may mask or simulate ventricular hypertrophy. Illustrative examples of these associations are shown to help the interpretation of electrocardiograms. The incidence and prevalence of the hemiblocks is presented based on studies performed in hospital patients and general populations. One of the most common causes of hemiblocks is coronary artery disease, and there is a particularly frequent association between anteroseptal myocardial infarction and left anterior hemiblock. The second most important cause is arterial hypertension, followed by cardiomyopathies and Lev and Lenègre diseases. The hemiblocks may also occur in aortic heart disease and congenital cardiopathies. Left anterior hemiblock is more common in men and increases in frequency with advancing age. Evidence is presented regarding the relationship of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defects, which may explain the finding of this and other conduction defects in young populations. Isolated left anterior hemiblock is a relatively frequent finding in subjects devoid of evidence of structural heart disease. Conversely, isolated left posterior hemiblock is a very rare finding; its prognostic significance is unknown and is commonly associated with right bundle-branch block. The most remarkable feature of this association is that the prognosis is much more serious with a great propensity to develop complete atrioventricular block and Adams-Stoke seizures.},\n  isbn = {1524-4539 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0009-7322 (Linking)},\n  keywords = {Bundle-branch block,Epidemiology,Heart block,Heart septal defects,Myocardial infarction},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/XV6EEXIF/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173409,"version":0},"$loki":897},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1802,"entry":"@article{Elvas2000,\n  title = {A Randomized Study of the Prevention of Sudden Death in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease.},\n  author = {Elvas, L.},\n  date = {2000},\n  journaltitle = {Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgão oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology},\n  volume = {19},\n  number = {2},\n  eprint = {10763358},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {271--273},\n  publisher = {{N Engl J Med}},\n  issn = {08702551},\n  doi = {10.1056/nejm199912163412503},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10601507/},\n  urldate = {2021-04-19},\n  keywords = {A E Buxton,Aged,Anti-Arrhythmia Agents / therapeutic use*,Artificial,Cardiac / epidemiology,Cardiac / prevention \\& control*,Cardiac Pacing,Clinical Trial,Coronary Disease / complications,Coronary Disease / drug therapy,Coronary Disease / mortality,Coronary Disease / therapy*,Death,Defibrillators,doi:10.1056/NEJM199912163412503,Electrophysiology,Female,G Hafley,Humans,Implantable*,K L Lee,Male,MEDLINE,Middle Aged,Multicenter Study,National Center for Biotechnology Information,National Institutes of Health,National Library of Medicine,NCBI,NIH,NLM,Non-U.S. Gov't,P.H.S.,pmid:10601507,PubMed Abstract,Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support,Sudden,Survival Analysis,Tachycardia,U.S. Gov't,Ventricular / etiology,Ventricular / mortality,Ventricular / therapy}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173414,"version":0},"$loki":898},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1658,"entry":"@article{Engel1989,\n  title = {Preliminary {{Report}}: {{Effect}} of {{Encainide}} and {{Flecainide}} on {{Mortality}} in a {{Randomized Trial}} of {{Arrhythmia Suppression}} after {{Myocardial Infarction}}},\n  author = {Engel, George L.},\n  date = {1989-08-10},\n  journaltitle = {New England Journal of Medicine},\n  volume = {321},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {2473403},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {406--412},\n  publisher = {{Massachusetts Medical Society}},\n  issn = {15334406},\n  doi = {10.1056/NEJM198908103210629},\n  url = {http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM198908103210629},\n  urldate = {2020-09-09},\n  abstract = {The occurrence of ventricular premature depolarizations in survivors of myocardial infarction is a risk factor for subsequent sudden death, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy reduces the risk is not known. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) is evaluating the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy (encainide, flecainide, or moricizine) in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (six or more ventricular premature beats per hour) after myocardial infarction. As of March 30, 1989, 2309 patients had been recruited for the initial drug-titration phase of the study: 1727 (75 percent) had initial suppression of their arrhythmia (as assessed by Holter recording) through the use of one of the three study drugs and had been randomly assigned to receive active drug or placebo. During an average of 10 months of follow-up, the patients treated with active drug had a higher rate of death from arrhythmia than the patients assigned to placebo. Encainide and flecainide accounted for the excess of deaths from arrhythmia and nonfatal cardiac arrests (33 of 730 patients taking encainide or flecainide [4.5 percent]; 9 of 725 taking placebo [1.2 percent]; relative risk, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 8.5). They also accounted for the higher total mortality (56 of 730 [7.7 percent] and 22 of 725 [3.0 percent], respectively; relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.5). Because of these results, the part of the trial involving encainide and flecainide has been discontinued. We conclude that neither encainide nor flecainide should be used in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction, even though these drugs may be effective initially in suppressing ventricular arrhythmia. Whether these results apply to other patients who might be candidates for antiarrhythmic therapy is unknown. © 1989, Massachusetts Medical Society.

In both ap- proaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recom- mended. Methods We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in pa- tients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. Results A total of 4060 patients (mean [±SD] age, 69.7±9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 per- cent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normal- ized ratio was subtherapeutic. Conclusions Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advan- tage over the rate-control strategy, and there are po- tential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoag- ulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.

We compared the effects of levosimendan and dobutamine on haemodynamic performance and clinical outcome in patients with low-output heart failure. Methods: Patients were recruited into a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial. Under continuous haemodynamic monitoring, an initial loading dose of levosimendan of 24 μg/kg was infused over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 μgkg-1 min-1 for 24 h. Dobutamine was infused for 24 h at an initial dose of 5 μg kg-1 min-1 without a loading dose. The infusion rate was doubled if the response was inadequate at 2h. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with haemodynamic improvement (defined as an increase of 30\\% or more in cardiac output and a decrease of 25\\% or more in pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure) at 24 h. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings: 103 patients were assigned levosimendan and 100 dobutamine. The primary haemodynamic endpoint was achieved in 29 (28\\%) levosimendan-group patients and 15 (15\\%) in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio 1.9 [95\\% CI 1.1-3.3]; p=0.022).

METHODS: In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned 308 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to receive furosemide administered intravenously by means of either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The protocol allowed specified dose adjustments after 48 hours. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours. RESULTS: In the comparison of bolus with continuous infusion, there was no significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms (mean AUC, 4236±1440 and 4373±1404, respectively; P = 0.47) or in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.05±0.3 mg per deciliter [4.4±26.5 ?mol per liter] and 0.07±0.3 mg per deciliter [6.2±26.5 μmol per liter], respectively; P = 0.45). In the comparison of the high-dose strategy with the low-dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (mean AUC, 4430±1401 vs. 4171±1436; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.08±0.3 mg per deciliter [7.1±26.5 μmol per liter] with the high-dose strategy and 0.04±0.3 mg per deciliter [3.5±26.5 μmol per liter] with the low-dose strategy, P = 0.21). The high-dose strategy was associated with greater diuresis and more favorable outcomes in some secondary measures but also with transient worsening of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

There are many electrophysiological differences between these pathways, including conduction time and electrical refractoriness, that increase the predisposition of the atrioventricular junction to arrhythmias such as atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia. These varied electrophysiological characteristics of the fast and slow pathways stem from their unique structural and molecular composition (tissue and cellular geometry, ion channels and gap junctions). This review summarises the structural and molecular heterogeneities of the human AVN and how they result in electrophysiological variations and arrhythmias.},\n  keywords = {Atrioventricular junction,Connexin,Dual-pathway electrophysiology,Ion channels,Optical mapping},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/B4M4WS54/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173460,"version":0},"$loki":905},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2163,"entry":"@article{George2017,\n  title = {Aortic {{Valve Annular Sizing}}},\n  author = {George, Isaac and Guglielmetti, Laura C. and Bettinger, Nicolas and Moss, Andrew and Wang, Catherine and Kheysin, Nathan and Hahn, Rebecca and Kodali, Susheel and Leon, Martin and Bapat, Vinayak and Borger, Michael A. and Williams, Mathew and Smith, Craig and Khalique, Omar K.},\n  date = {2017-05},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging},\n  volume = {10},\n  number = {5},\n  issn = {1941-9651},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.116.005968}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173462,"version":0},"$loki":906},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":344,"entry":"@article{Giles1974,\n  title = {Gallavardin {{Phenomenon}} in {{Aortic Stenosis}}: {{A Possible Mechanism}}},\n  author = {Giles, Thomas D. and Martinez, Enrique C. and Burch, George E.},\n  date = {1974},\n  journaltitle = {Archives of Internal Medicine},\n  volume = {134},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {4278106},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {747--749},\n  issn = {15383679},\n  doi = {10.1001/archinte.1974.00320220149021},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/RKSS82AH/1974-gallavardin phenomenon.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173465,"version":0},"$loki":907},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2868,"entry":"@article{Goldstein2015,\n  title = {Multimodality {{Imaging}} of {{Diseases}} of the {{Thoracic Aorta}} in {{Adults}}: {{From}} the {{American Society}} of {{Echocardiography}} and the {{European Association}} of {{Cardiovascular Imaging}}},\n  shorttitle = {Multimodality {{Imaging}} of {{Diseases}} of the {{Thoracic Aorta}} in {{Adults}}},\n  author = {Goldstein, Steven A. and Evangelista, Arturo and Abbara, Suhny and Arai, Andrew and Asch, Federico M. and Badano, Luigi P. and Bolen, Michael A. and Connolly, Heidi M. and Cuéllar-Calàbria, Hug and Czerny, Martin and Devereux, Richard B. and Erbel, Raimund A. and Fattori, Rossella and Isselbacher, Eric M. and Lindsay, Joseph M. and McCulloch, Marti and Michelena, Hector I. and Nienaber, Christoph A. and Oh, Jae K. and Pepi, Mauro and Taylor, Allen J. and Weinsaft, Jonathan W. and Zamorano, Jose Luis and Dietz, Harry and Eagle, Kim and Elefteriades, John and Jondeau, Guillaume and Rousseau, Hervé and Schepens, Marc},\n  date = {2015-02},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography},\n  volume = {28},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {119--182},\n  issn = {08947317},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.echo.2014.11.015},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0894731714008591},\n  urldate = {2023-06-11},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/N7LNU7LD/Goldstein et al. - 2015 - Multimodality Imaging of Diseases of the Thoracic .pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173470,"version":0},"$loki":908},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2103,"entry":"@article{Goyal1996,\n  title = {Comparison of the Ages of Tachycardia Onset in Patients with Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia and Accessory Pathway-Mediated Tachycardia},\n  author = {Goyal, Rajiva and Zivin, Adam and Souza, Joseph and Shaikh, Shahzad A. and Harvey, Mark and Bogun, Frank and Daoud, Emile and Man, K.

Although Stage D HF has recently been defined as end-stage disease requiring special interventions for survival such as COSI or ventricular assist devices, concern has been raised regarding the safety, efficacy, mortality outcomes, and ethics of COSI. Methods and Results: Inotrope dependence was defined as worsening of the patient's clinical status with attempted inotrope withdrawal such that the patient was deemed unlikely to survive to permit hospital discharge. A care process for COSI was designed; baseline and outcome variables were evaluated. COSI was administered to 36 inotrope-dependent patients (age 55.4 ± 9.5 years, 24 males). Baseline characteristics (mean ± SD) were consistent with Stage D HF: left ventricular ejection fraction 19.9 ± 8.5, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) 70 ± 10 mm, systolic blood pressure 97.4 ± 13.4 mm Hg, serum creatinine 1.5 ± 0.6, serum sodium 131.7 ± 5.3; 69 HF hospitalizations (mean 1.9 ± 1.8) 6 months before COSI initiation. Symptomatic hypotension, increasing dyspnea, renal dysfunction, and hypoperfusion most commonly prevented inotrope withdrawal. Despite Stage D HF, patients were discharged with COSI ambulatory, oriented, and pain free. Rehospitalizations were 46; 6 subjects accounted for 24 hospitalizations; 23 had 0 or 1 rehospitalization. Median survival was 3.4 months (range 0.2.26.3 months); and 3-, 6-, and 12-month Kaplan Meier survival was 51\\%, 26\\%, and 6\\%, respectively. The majority of patients died at home and chose to not undergo resuscitation attempts.

Methods and Results: A new pacing method, para-Hisian pacing, was tested in 149 patients with AP and 53 patients without AP who had AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Ventricular pacing was performed adjacent to the His bundle and proximal right bundle branch (HB-RB), initially at high output to capture both RV and HB-RB. The output was then decreased to lose HB-RB capture. The change in timing and sequence of retrograde atrial activation between HB-RB capture and noncapture was examined. Loss of HB-RB capture without change in stimulus- atrial (S-A) interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AP conduction. An increase in S-A interval without change in His bundle-atrial interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AVN conduction. A change in atrial activation sequence indicated the presence of both retrograde AP and AVN conduction. Para-Hisian pacing correctly identified retrograde AP conduction in 132 of 147 AP patients, including all septal and right free wall APs. Retrograde AVN conduction masked AP conduction in 9 of 34 patients with a left free wall AP and 6 of 9 patients with the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia. Para-Hisian pacing correctly excluded AP conduction in all 53 patients with AVNRT. Conclusions: Para-Hisian pacing reliably identifies retrograde conduction over septal and right free wall APs, but AVN conduction may mask APs located far from the pacing site or with a long retrograde conduction time.},\n  keywords = {accessory AV pathway,atrioventricular node,conduction,electrophysiology,pacing}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173491,"version":0},"$loki":914},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1805,"entry":"@article{Hohnloser2004,\n  title = {Prophylactic {{Use}} of an {{Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator After Acute Myocardial Infarction}}. {{Amiodarone}} or an {{Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator}} for {{Congestive Heart Failure}}},\n  author = {Virk, Imran S. and Ip, Randy},\n  date = {2005-12-09},\n  journaltitle = {Congestive Heart Failure},\n  volume = {11},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {157--158},\n  publisher = {{N Engl J Med}},\n  issn = {1527-5299},\n  doi = {10.1111/j.1527-5299.2005.04172.x},\n  url = {http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa041489},\n  urldate = {2021-04-19},\n  keywords = {Adult,Aged,Arrhythmias,Cardiac / epidemiology,Cardiac / etiology,Cardiac / mortality,Cardiac / prevention \\& control,Cardiac / prevention \\& control*,Clinical Trial,Comparative Study,Death,Defibrillators,DINAMIT Investigators,doi:10.1056/NEJMoa041489,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Implantable*,Karl Heinz Kuck,Left / etiology,Male,MEDLINE,Middle Aged,Multicenter Study,Myocardial Infarction / complications,Myocardial Infarction / mortality,Myocardial Infarction / therapy*,National Center for Biotechnology Information,National Institutes of Health,National Library of Medicine,NCBI,NIH,NLM,Non-U.S. Gov't,pmid:15590950,PubMed Abstract,Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support,Risk,Stefan H Hohnloser,Stroke Volume,Sudden,Survival Analysis,Ventricular Dysfunction}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173494,"version":0},"$loki":915},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":71,"entry":"@article{Hunt1994,\n  title = {The Problem Student on Clinical Rotations: A Comparison of {{Malaysian}} and {{North American}} Views.},\n  author = {Hunt, D D and Khalid, B A and Shahabudin, S H and Rogayah, J},\n  date = {1994-09},\n  journaltitle = {Medical Journal of Malaysia},\n  volume = {49},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {7845279},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {275--281},\n  issn = {03005283},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7845279},\n  urldate = {2018-03-14},\n  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the types of problem students that clinical teachers encounter in clinical settings.

Dynamic imaging with positron emission tomography allows the quantitative delineation of myocardial tracer kinetics and, hence, the measurement of physiologic processes such as myocardial blood flow. To test this hypothesis, positron emission tomographic imaging in combination with N-13 ammonia was performed at rest and after pharmacologically induced vasodilation in seven healthy volunteers. Myocardial and blood time-activity curves derived from regions of interest over the heart and ventricular chamber were fitted using a three compartment model for N-13 ammonia, yielding rate constants for tracer uptake and retention. Myocardial blood flow (K1) averaged 88 ± 17 ml/min per 100 g at rest and increased to 417 ± 112 ml/min per 100 g after dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg) and handgrip exercise. The coronary reserve averaged 4.8 ± 1.3 and was not significantly different in the septal, anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle. Blood flow values showed only a minor dependence on the correction for blood metabolites of N-13 ammonia. These data demonstrate that quantification of regional myocardial blood flow is feasible by dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging. The observed coronary flow reserve after dipyridamole is in close agreement with the results obtained by invasive techniques, indicating accurate flow estimates over a wide range. Thus, positron emission tomography may provide accurate and noninvasive definition of the functional significance of coronary artery disease and may allow the improved selection of patients for revascularization. © 1990.}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173503,"version":0},"$loki":918},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2167,"entry":"@article{Hwang2017,\n  title = {Conduction Disturbance after Isolated Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Degenerative Aortic Stenosis},\n  author = {Hwang, You Mi and Kim, Jun and Lee, Ji Hyun and Kim, Minsu and Hwang, Jongmin and Kim, Joon Bum and Jung, Sung Ho and Choo, Suk Jung and Nam, Gi Byoung and Choi, Kee Joon and Chung, Cheol Hyun and Lee, Jae Won and Kim, You Ho},\n  date = {2017-11-01},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery},\n  volume = {154},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {28712585},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1556-1565.e1},\n  publisher = {{Mosby Inc.}},\n  issn = {1097685X},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.05.101},\n  abstract = {Objective Conduction disturbances are common in patients with aortic stenosis.

During the mean follow-up period of 1288 ± 1122 days, 64 patients (9.7\\%) developed irreversible conduction disorders (bundle branch block n = 24 and first-degree atrioventricular block n = 42). Of the 10 patients requiring permanent pacemakers, 4 remained depend on the permanent pacemaker during follow-up. Beyond 30 days after aortic valve replacement, 1 patient underwent permanent pacemaker implantation for de novo conduction disturbance 44 months postoperatively. Conclusions After isolated aortic valve replacement, permanent pacemaker implantation for conduction disturbance is rare (n = 10/663, 1.5\\%). Isolated aortic valve replacement for degenerative aortic stenosis has a low risk of conduction disturbances during long-term follow-up.},\n  keywords = {aortic valve stenosis,heart block,heart valve prosthesis implantation,pacemaker artificial},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3DPYYJYN/PIIS0022522317311820.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173506,"version":0},"$loki":919},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2044,"entry":"@book{Issa2018,\n  title = {Clinical Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology: {{A}} Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease},\n  author = {Issa, Ziad F. and Miller, John M. and Zipes, Douglas P.},\n  date = {2018},\n  journaltitle = {Clinical Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}},\n  doi = {10.1016/C2014-0-03293-5},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/C20140032935},\n  urldate = {2022-11-13},\n  abstract = {Part of the highly regarded Braunwald’s family of cardiology references, Clinical Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology, 3rd Edition, offers complete coverage of the latest diagnosis and management options for patients with arrhythmias.

However, the value of prophylactic implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden death in such patients is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 458 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 36 percent, and premature ventricular complexes or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. A total of 229 patients were randomly assigned to receive standard medical therapy, and 229 to receive standard medical therapy plus a single-chamber ICD. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a mean (±SD) of 29.0±14.4 months. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 21 percent. The vast majority of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (86 percent) and beta-blockers (85 percent). There were 68 deaths: 28 in the ICD group, as compared with 40 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 1.06; P=0.08). The mortality rate at two years was 14.1 percent in the standard-therapy group (annual mortality rate, 7 percent) and 7.9 percent in the ICD group. There were 17 sudden deaths from arrhythmia: 3 in the ICD group, as compared with 14 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95 percentconfidence interval, 0.06 to 0.71; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe, nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who were treated with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator significantly reduced the risk of sudden death from arrhythmia and was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death from any cause.},\n  keywords = {80 and over,Adrenergic beta-Antagonists / therapeutic use*,Adult,Aged,Alan Dyer,Alan Kadish,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors / therape,Arrhythmias,Cardiac / complications,Cardiac / etiology,Cardiac / mortality,Cardiac / prevention \\& control,Cardiomyopathy,Clinical Trial,Combined Modality Therapy,Death,Defibrillators,Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Trea,Dilated / complications,Dilated / drug therapy,Dilated / mortality,Dilated / therapy*,doi:10.1056/NEJMoa033088,Female,Humans,Implantable*,Left / complications,Left / therapy,Male,MEDLINE,Middle Aged,Multicenter Study,National Center for Biotechnology Information,National Institutes of Health,National Library of Medicine,NCBI,NIH,NLM,Non-U.S. Gov't,pmid:15152060,PubMed Abstract,Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support,Stroke Volume,Sudden,Ventricular Dysfunction}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173526,"version":0},"$loki":923},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":159,"entry":"@article{Kakouros2010,\n  title = {Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction: {{Pathophysiology}}, Diagnosis, and Management},\n  author = {Kakouros, Nicholaos and Cokkinos, Dennis V.},\n  date = {2010},\n  journaltitle = {Postgraduate Medical Journal},\n  volume = {86},\n  number = {1022},\n  eprint = {20956396},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {719--728},\n  issn = {00325473},\n  doi = {10.1136/pgmj.2010.103887},\n  abstract = {Right ventricular (RV) ischaemia complicates up to 50\\% of inferior myocardial infarctions (MIs), though isolated RV myocardial infarction (RVMI) is extremely rare.

Recently, time-honored conventional schemes for the diagnosis and classification of the various forms of the arrhythmia have been refuted in part by evolving evidence. Recognition of the various types of AVNRT is important, however, to expedite diagnosis and allow implementation of appropriate ablation therapy without complications. We present an update on AVNRT with a particular emphasis on electrophysiological criteria used for the differential diagnosis of regular, su-praventricular tachycardias. ECG Presentation Typically, AVNRT is a narrow-complex tachycardia, ie, QRS duration 120 ms, unless aberrant conduction, which is usually of the right bundle-branch type, or a previous conduction defect exists. Tachycardia-related ST depression and RR-interval variation may be seen. RR alternans in AVNRT has been attributed to the proposed model of a figure of 8 reentry with continuous crossing over of antegrade activation through an inferior input to the contralateral superior input via the node. 2 In the typical form of AVNRT (slow-fast), abnormal (retrograde) P waves are constantly related to the QRS and in the majority of cases are indiscernible or very close to the QRS complex (RP/RR 0.5). Thus, P waves are either masked by the QRS complex or seen as a small terminal P wave that is not present during sinus rhythm (Figure 1). In the atypical form of AVNRT (fast-slow), P waves are clearly visible before the QRS, ie, RP/PR 0.75 (Figure 2), denoting a \"long RP tachycardia,\" and are negative in leads II, III, aVF, and V 6 but positive in V 1. P waves are shallow in the inferior leads in the rare form of anterior fast-slow AVNRT. 3 Although AV dissociation is usually not seen, it can occur because neither the atria or the ventricles are necessary for the reentry circuit. If the tachycardia is initiated by atrial ectopic beats, the initial (ectopic) P wave usually differs from the subsequent (retrograde) P waves (Figure 1).},\n  keywords = {Arrhythmia,Atrioventricular node,Tachycardia},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/NI2H7D68/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173533,"version":0},"$loki":925},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1808,"entry":"@article{Kedia2012,\n  title = {Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators: {{Indications}} and Unresolved Issues},\n  author = {Kedia, Rohit and Saeed, Mohammad},\n  date = {2012},\n  journaltitle = {Texas Heart Institute Journal},\n  volume = {39},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {22719141},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {335--341},\n  publisher = {{Texas Heart Institute}},\n  issn = {07302347},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC3368443/},\n  urldate = {2021-04-19},\n  abstract = {Since the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was first used clinically in 1980, several large randomized controlled trials have shown that therapy with this device can be beneficial in various patient populations.

It is unclear whether early rhythm-control therapy can reduce this risk. METHODS In this international, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial, we randomly assigned patients who had early atrial fibrillation (diagnosed ≤1 year before enrollment) and cardiovascular conditions to receive either early rhythm control or usual care. Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year. The primary safety outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms and left ventricular function, were also evaluated. RESULTS In 135 centers, 2789 patients with early atrial fibrillation (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for efficacy at the third interim analysis after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up per patient. A first-primary-outcome event occurred in 249 of the patients assigned to early rhythm control (3.9 per 100 person-years) and in 316 patients assigned to usual care (5.0 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96\\% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P\\,=\\,0.005). The mean (±SD) number of nights spent in the hospital did not differ significantly between the groups (5.8±21.9 and 5.1±15.5 days per year, respectively; P\\,=\\,0.23). The percentage of patients with a primary safety outcome event did not differ significantly between the groups; serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy occurred in 4.9\\% of the patients assigned to early rhythm control and 1.4\\% of the patients assigned to usual care. Symptoms and left ventricular function at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Early rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.

Progressive RV dysfunction in these disease states is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of RHF. METHODS: The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through September 2017. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or reference to contemporary clinical practice recommendations. RESULTS: Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output and progressive end-organ damage (caused by a combination of end-organ venous congestion and underperfusion), and cachexia resulting from poor absorption of nutrients, as well as a systemic proinflammatory state. It is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similarly, acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients presenting with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by its complex geometry. Multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. Pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated. Specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: RHF is a complex syndrome including diverse causes, pathways, and pathological processes.

However, a newly proposed single-syringe technique (SST), in which adenosine is diluted with an up to 20 ml IV bolus of NSS, was found to be beneficial. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the SST was noninferior to the DST for terminating stable SVT. Methods: A pilot multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted at nine hospitals in north and northeast Thailand. Thirty patients who were diagnosed with stable SVT were randomized into two groups of 15, with one receiving adenosine via the DST and the other via the SST. We examined SVT termination, the average successful dose, and the complication rate of each group. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Result: The termination rate was 93.3\\% in the DST and 100\\% in the SST group (p = 1.000), and the success rate of the first 6-mg dose of adenosine was 73.3\\% and 80\\%, respectively (p = 1.000). The total administered dose was 8.6 ± 5.1 mg in the DST group and 7.6 ± 4.5 mg in the SST group (p =.608). No complications were found in either group. Conclusions: The SST was non-inferior to the DST for termination of SVT. However, a further definitive study with a larger sample size is required.},\n  keywords = {adenosine,efficacy and side effects,single-syringe technique,supraventricular tachycardia}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173557,"version":0},"$loki":930},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2104,"entry":"@article{Krinock2021,\n  title = {Frog Sign and {{AV}} Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia: {{A}} Case Report},\n  author = {Krinock, Matthew and Stone, Lauren and Yellapu, Vikas and Amaratunga, Eluwana and Parameswaran, Anish and Krinock, Gabrielle and Nanda, Sudip N.},\n  date = {2021-07-01},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Critical Illness and Injury Science},\n  volume = {11},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {34760667},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {185--187},\n  publisher = {{Wolters Kluwer -- Medknow Publications}},\n  issn = {22315004},\n  doi = {10.4103/IJCIIS.IJCIIS_118_20},\n  url = {/pmc/articles/PMC8547684/},\n  urldate = {2022-11-23},\n  abstract = {Supraventricular tachycardia is one the most frequent cardiac arrhythmias seen in patients, with AVNRT being the most common subtype.

History Kantrowitz 1 described augmentation of coronary blood flow by retardation of the arterial pressure pulse in animal models in 1952. In 1958, Harken 2 suggested the removal of some of the blood volume via the femoral artery during systole and replacing it rapidly in diastole as a treatment for left ventricular (LV) failure, so called diastolic augmentation. Four years later, Moulopoulos and colleagues 3 developed an experimental prototype of an IABP whose inflation and deflation were timed to the cardiac cycle. In 1968, Kantrowitz 1 reported improved systemic arterial pressure and urine output with the use of an IABP in two subjects with cardio-genic shock, one of who survived to hospital dis-charge. Percutaneous IABs in sizes 8.5–9.5 French (rather than 15 French used earlier) were introduced in 1979, and shortly after this, Bergman and colleagues 4 described the first per-cutaneous insertion of IABP.

Methods and Results - From 1987, eligible patients were randomized to an ICD, amiodarone, propafenone, or metoprolol (ICD versus antiarrhythmic agents randomization ratio 1:3). Assignment to propafenone was discontinued in March 1992, after an interim analysis conducted in 58 patients showed a 61\\% higher all-cause mortality rate than in 61 ICD patients during a follow-up of 11.3 months. The study continued to recruit 288 patients in the remaining 3 study groups; of these, 99 were assigned to ICDs, 92 to amiodarone, and 97 to metoprolol. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The study was terminated in March 1998, when all patients had concluded a minimum 2-year follow-up. Over a mean follow-up of 57±34 months, the crude death rates were 36.4\\% (95\\% CI 26.9\\% to 46.6\\%) in the ICD and 44.4\\% (95\\% CI 37.2\\% to 51.8\\%) in the amiodarone/metoprolol arm. Overall survival was higher, though not significantly, in patients assigned to ICD than in those assigned to drug therapy (1-sided P=0.081, hazard ratio 0.766, [97.5\\% CI upper bound 1.112]). In ICD patients, the percent reductions in all-cause mortality were 41.9\\%, 39.3\\%, 28.4\\%, 27.7\\%, 22.8\\%, 11.4\\%, 9.1\\%, 10.6\\%, and 24.7\\% at years 1 to 9 of follow-up. Conclusions - During long-term follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors, therapy with an ICD is associated with a 23\\% (nonsignificant) reduction of all-cause mortality rates when compared with treatment with amiodarone/metoprolol.

The concept of dual pathway physiology remains useful, although this physiology likely results from the functional properties of anisotropic tissue within the triangle of Koch, rather than anatomically distinct tracts of conduction. Also, there remains debate regarding whether the critical reentrant circuit path requires participation of the atrium. In our opinion, current evidence favors functional anisotropic reentry limited to the subatrial tissues as the arrhythmia mechanism. Reasons for this are reviewed. Fortunately, typical AVNRT is readily amenable to definitive therapy by catheter-based radiofrequency energy delivery at the so-called slow pathway region located at the posterior Triangle of Koch. Anterior or left-sided approaches are very rarely indicated. Results from multiple series have shown this strategy to be both safe and effective, therefore ablation therapy should now be considered as the definitive therapy of choice for the majority of patients.},\n  keywords = {Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia,Atrioventricular node,Dual atrioventricular nodal physiology,Radiofrequency catheter ablation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/LIEIIUQL/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173570,"version":0},"$loki":934},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":56,"entry":"@article{Lacasse2012,\n  title = {Challenging Learning Situations in Medical Education},\n  author = {Lacasse, Miriam and Theoret, Johanne and Skalenda, Patrick and Lee, Shirley},\n  date = {2012},\n  journaltitle = {Canadian Family Physician},\n  volume = {58},\n  pages = {802--803},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3A7NTGGE/m-api-099ce822-5396-ffd7-1f9b-988ff002347d.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173571,"version":0},"$loki":935},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":46,"entry":"@article{Lacasse2012a,\n  title = {Challenging Learning Situations in Medical Education: {{Innovative}} and Structured Tools for Assessment, Educational Diagnosis, and Intervention. {{Part}} 1: History or Data Gathering},\n  author = {Lacasse, M and Théorêt, J and Skalenda, P and Lee, S},\n  date = {2012},\n  journaltitle = {Canadian Family Physician},\n  volume = {58},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {22499820},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {481--484},\n  issn = {1715-5258},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3325462/},\n  urldate = {2018-03-12},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/XXE49IM6/m-api-66ce389c-ba42-05c3-719c-44202c039041.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173573,"version":0},"$loki":936},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1938,"entry":"@article{Ladejobi2018a,\n  title = {Implantable Defibrillator Therapy in Cardiac Arrest Survivors with a Reversible Cause},\n  author = {Ladejobi, Adetola and Pasupula, Deepak K. and Adhikari, Shubash and Javed, Awais and Durrani, Asad F. and Patil, Shantanu and Qin, Dingxin and Ahmad, Shahzad and Munir, Muhammad Bilal and Rijal, Shasank and Wayne, Max and Adelstein, Evan and Jain, Sandeep and Saba, Samir},\n  date = {2018-03-01},\n  journaltitle = {Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology},\n  volume = {11},\n  number = {3},\n  eprint = {29545361},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  publisher = {{Lippincott Williams and Wilkins}},\n  issn = {19413084},\n  doi = {10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005940},\n  url = {http://ahajournals.org},\n  urldate = {2021-04-19},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), except in those with completely reversible causes. We sought to examine the impact of ICD therapy on mortality in survivors of SCA associated with reversible causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the records of 1433 patients managed at our institution between 2000 and 2012 who were discharged alive after SCA. A reversible and correctable cause was identified in 792 (55\\%) patients. Reversible SCA cause was defined as significant electrolyte or metabolic abnormality, evidence of acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, recent initiation of antiarrhythmic drug or illicit drug use, or other reversible circumstances. Of the 792 SCA survivors because of a reversible and correctable cause (age 61±15 years, 40\\% women), 207 (26\\%) patients received an ICD after their index SCA. During a mean follow-up of 3.8±3.1 years, 319 (40\\%) patients died. ICD implantation was highly associated with lower all-cause mortality (P{$<$}0.001) even after correcting for unbalanced baseline characteristics (P{$<$}0.001). In subgroup analyses, only patients whose SCA was not associated with myocardial infarction extracted benefit from ICD (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In survivors of SCA because of a reversible and correctable cause, ICD therapy is associated with lower all-cause mortality except if the SCA was because of myocardial infarction.

Mortality risk in those populations was poorly investigated. In addition, hemodynamic, morphological, and mechanical factors that influence or predict outcome of rheumatic mitral stenosis have not been identified. Aims: To determine predictive factors affecting outcome in rheumatic mitral stenosis patients. Method: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the National General Hospital Dr. Sardjito, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The study recruited patients from the Valvular Heart Disease Registry from May 2014 to November 2020. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, invasive or surgical treatment, and incidence of death were recorded. The baseline rhythm from electrocardiography (ECG) was categorized as sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Based on the findings of trans thoracal echocardiography (TTE), subjects who had moderate to severe pure rheumatic mitral stenosis (or followed by mitral regurgitation and / or less significant tricuspid regurgitation as a natural history) and subjects with rheumatic mitral stenosis with a combination of other heart valve problems (of which severity more significantly) classified as groups I and II. The mitral valve area (MVA), mitral valve gradient (MVG), left atrial diameter (LA), and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) were then analyzed. Results: A total of 477 patients (mean age 44.08 ± 10.93 years; 71.5\\% female) were enrolled in this study. There were 61 deaths during the median follow up of 393 days of which 35 deaths occurred in group I and 26 deaths occurred in group II.

The H-V (His bundle-to-ventricle) time was short in all three patients. Atrial pacing in two patients produced an attenuated degree of prolongation of the A-H time without a change in conduction distal to the proximal His bundle. The probable mechanisms of accelerated conduction in these three patients include: (1) partial A-V nodal bypass via (a) the posterior intemodal tract or (b) functional bypass fibers within the A-V node; and (2) accelerated conduction within the A-V conduction system distal to the A-V node.

Recent development of a technique for the recording of electrical activity from the specialized conducting system in the human heart2 has aided considerably in the study of abnormalities of the A-V conduction system.2-5 In an effort to elucidate more completely the electrophysiologic features of the Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome, three patients who presented with this syndrome were studied. Method A-V conduction was studied during cardiac catheterization in the postabsorptive state. Patients were premedicated with secobarbital, 100 mg by mouth, 1 hour prior to catheterization. The procedure was explained to the patients in detail and informed consent was obtained.

However, cross-sectional data show that only a fraction are clinically diagnosed, suggesting under-recognition, with most clinicians exposed to small segments of the broad disease spectrum. Highly effective HCM management strategies have emerged, altering clinical course and substantially lowering mortality and morbidity rates. These advances underscore the importance of reliable HCM diagnosis with echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Family screening with noninvasive imaging will identify relatives with the HCM phenotype, while genetic analysis recognizes preclinical sarcomere gene carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy, but with the potential to transmit disease.

Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means of improving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, had unacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergo either catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-based therapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35\\% or less, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end point occurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in the medicaltherapy group (51 patients [28.5\\%] vs. 82 patients [44.6\\%]; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.87; P = 0.007). Significantly fewer patients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4\\%] vs. 46 [25.0\\%]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95\\% CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P = 0.01), were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (37 [20.7\\%] vs. 66 [35.9\\%]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95\\% CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P = 0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2\\%] vs. 41 [22.3\\%]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95\\% CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy.

Additionally, the current group of medical trainees is largely represented by the Millennial Generation, a generation characterized by an affinity for technology, interaction, and group-based learning. Special attention must be paid to take into account the learning needs of a generation that has only ever known life with duty hours. A mnemonic for strategies to augment teaching rounds for hospitalists was created using an approach that considers time limitations due to duty hours as well as the preferences of Millennial learners. These strategies to enhance learning during teaching rounds are Flipping the Wards, Using Documentation to Teach, Technology-Enabled Teaching, Using Guerilla Teaching Tactics, Rainy Day Teaching, and Embedding Teaching Moments into Rounds (FUTURE). Hospitalists serving as teaching attendings should consider these possible strategies as ways to enhance teaching in the post-duty hours era. These techniques appeal to the preferences of today's learners in an environment often limited by time constraints. Hospitalists are well positioned to champion innovative approaches to teaching in a dynamic and evolving clinical learning environment.

METHODS: We studied 205 residents and 148 faculty in family medicine who completed the Clinical Teaching Perception Inventory (CTPI) online between April 2001 and July 2008. The participants ranked 28 single-word descriptors that characterized clinical teachers along a 7-point-scale ranging from \"least like my ideal teacher\" to \"most like my ideal teacher.\" RESULTS: Both residents and faculty indicated that the ideal clinical teachers should be stimulating, encouraging, competent, and communicating and should not be conventional, cautious, or controlling. However, residents rated probing and innovative significantly lower than did faculty. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical faculty and residents in family medicine have a shared view of the ideal clinical teacher. However, residents and faculty differed in their ratings on the descriptors \"Probing\" and \"Innovative.\" This difference might at least in part stem from where residents and faculty are located along a continuum from novice to mature expert.},\n  isbn = {1938-3800 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0742-3225 (Linking)},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/DVR728KN/m-api-227a4e22-57d7-194b-3776-532b6f100e45.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173605,"version":0},"$loki":946},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1601,"entry":"@article{McFalls2004,\n  title = {Coronary-Artery Revascularization before Elective Major Vascular Surgery},\n  author = {McFalls, Edward O. and Ward, Herbert B. and Moritz, Thomas E. and Goldman, Steven and Krupski, William C. and Littooy, Fred and Pierpont, Gordon and Santilli, Steve and Rapp, Joseph and Hattler, Brack and Shunk, Kendrick and Jaenicke, Connie and Thottapurathu, Lizy and Ellis, Nancy and Reda, Domenic J. and Henderson, William G.},\n  date = {2004-12-30},\n  journaltitle = {New England Journal of Medicine},\n  volume = {351},\n  number = {27},\n  eprint = {15625331},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {2795--2804},\n  publisher = {{Massachusetts Medical Society}},\n  issn = {00284793},\n  doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa041905},\n  url = {http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa041905},\n  urldate = {2020-07-13},\n  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of coronary-artery revascularization before elective major vascular surgery is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients at increased risk for perioperative cardiac complications and clinically significant coronary artery disease to undergo either revascularization or no revascularization before elective major vascular surgery. The primary end point was long-term mortality. RESULTS: Of 5859 patients scheduled for vascular operations at 18 Veterans Affairs medical centers, 510 (9 percent) were eligible for the study and were randomly assigned to either coronary-artery revascularization before surgery or no revascularization before surgery. The indications for a vascular operation were an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (33 percent) or arterial occlusive disease of the legs (67 percent). Among the patients assigned to preoperative coronary-artery revascularization, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 59 percent, and bypass surgery was performed in 41 percent. The median time from randomization to vascular surgery was 54 days in the revascularization group and 18 days in the group not undergoing revascularization (P{$<$}0.001). At 2.7 years after randomization, mortality in the revascularization group was 22 percent and in the no-revascularization group 23 percent (relative risk, 0.98; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.37; P=0.92). Within 30 days after the vascular operation, a postoperative myocardial infarction, defined by elevated troponin levels, occurred in 12 percent of the revascularization group and 14 percent of the no-revascularization group (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery does not significantly alter the long-term outcome. On the basis of these data, a strategy of coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery among patients with stable cardiac symptoms cannot be recommended.

Objective: To assess the effect of a short-term intravenous infusion of levosimendan or dobutamine on long-term survival. Design, Setting, and Patients: The Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support (SURVIVE) study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous levosimendan or dobutamine in 1327 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure who required inotropic support. The trial was conducted at 75 centers in 9 countries and patients were randomized between March 2003 and December 2004. Interventions: Intravenous levosimendan (n=664) or intravenous dobutamine (n=663). Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality at 180 days. Results: All-cause mortality at 180 days occurred in 173 (26\\%) patients in the levosimendan group and 185 (28\\%) patients in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.74-1.13; P=.40). The levosimendan group had greater decreases in B-type natriuretic peptide level at 24 hours that persisted through 5 days compared with the dobutamine group (P{$<$}.001 for all time points). There were no statistical differences between treatment groups for the other secondary end points (all-cause mortality at 31 days, number of days alive and out of the hospital, patient global assessment, patient assessment of dyspnea at 24 hours, and cardiovascular mortality at 180 days). There was a higher incidence of cardiac failure in the dobutamine group. There were higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, and headache in the levosimendan group. Conclusion: Despite an initial reduction in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the dobutamine group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days or affect any secondary clinical outcomes.

Analysing qualitative data about resident teachers' self-perceptions can offer helpful insights. METHODS: One year after a randomised trial of a residents-as-teachers curriculum at a university medical centre, we invited its 23 resident participants to participate in semistructured interviews. We interviewed 21 third year residents from internal medicine, family medicine and paediatrics, including 12 intervention residents who had been randomly assigned to receive a 13-hour teacher training programme and 9 control residents who had received no training. We used grounded theory techniques. Two investigators independently content-analysed the transcribed interviews for emerging themes and we then developed a schema for a third investigator to code the transcripts. RESULTS: Three key themes consistently emerged: enthusiasm for teaching (current and future), learner-centredness, and self-knowledge about teaching. Compared with control residents, the intervention residents expressed greater enthusiasm for teaching, more learner-centred and empathic approaches, and a richer understanding of teaching principles and skills. Most intervention residents wanted to continue teaching during and after training. Fewer control residents enjoyed their current teaching, and fewer still wanted to teach in the future. The control residents seemed easily frustrated by time constraints and they often expressed cynicism and blame toward learners. DISCUSSION: One year after participating in a randomised trial of a residents-as-teachers curriculum, generalist residents revealed fairly consistent perceptions of their teaching roles.

We studied, whether prophylactic therapy with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, as compared with conventional medical therapy, would improve survival in this high-risk group of patients. Methods: Over the course of five years, 196 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I, II, or III with prior myocardial infarction; a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤0.35; a documented episode of asymptomatic unsustained ventricular tachycardia; and inducible, nonsuppressible ventricular tachyarrhythmia on electrophysiologic study were randomly assigned to receive an implanted defibrillator (n=95) or conventional medical therapy (n= 101). We used a two-sided sequential design with death from any cause as the end point. Results: The base-line characteristics of the two treatment groups were similar. During an average follow-up of 27 months, there were 15 deaths in the defibrillator group (11 from cardiac causes) and 39 deaths in the conventional-therapy group (27 from cardiac causes) (hazard ratio for overall mortality, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.82; P=0.009). There was no evidence that amiodarone, beta-blockers, or any other antiarrhythmic therapy had a significant influence on the observed hazard ratio.

This randomized trial was designed to evaluate the effect of an implantable defibrillator on survival in such patients. METHODS Over the course of four years, we enrolled 1232 patients with a prior myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.30 or less. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive an implantable defibrillator (742 patients) or conventional medical therapy (490 patients). Invasive electrophysiological testing for risk stratification was not required. Death from any cause was the end point. RESULTS The clinical characteristics at base line and the prevalence of medication use at the time of the last follow-up visit were similar in the two treatment groups. During an average follow-up of 20 months, the mortality rates were 19.8 percent in the conventional-therapy group and 14.2 percent in the defibrillator group. The hazard ratio for the risk of death from any cause in the defibrillator group as compared with the conventional-therapy group was 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.93; P=0.016). The effect of defibrillator therapy on survival was similar in subgroup analyses stratified according to age, sex, ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, and the QRS interval.

Objective: To determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than conventional medical therapy for improving outcomes in AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial involving 126 centers in 10 countries. A total of 2204 symptomatic patients with AF aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for stroke were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. Interventions: The catheter ablation group (n = 1108) underwent pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablative procedures at the discretion of site investigators. The drug therapy group (n = 1096) received standard rhythm and/or rate control drugs guided by contemporaneous guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Among 13 prespecified secondary end points, 3 are included in this report: all-cause mortality; total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization; and AF recurrence. Results: Of the 2204 patients randomized (median age, 68 years; 37.2\\% female; 42.9\\% had paroxysmal AF and 57.1\\% had persistent AF), 89.3\\% completed the trial. Of the patients assigned to catheter ablation, 1006 (90.8\\%) underwent the procedure. Of the patients assigned to drug therapy, 301 (27.5\\%) ultimately received catheter ablation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, over a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the primary end point occurred in 8.0\\% (n = 89) of patients in the ablation group vs 9.2\\% (n = 101) of patients in the drug therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95\\% CI, 0.65-1.15]; P =.30). Among the secondary end points, outcomes in the ablation group vs the drug therapy group, respectively, were 5.2\\% vs 6.1\\% for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.85 [95\\% CI, 0.60-1.21]; P =.38), 51.7\\% vs 58.1\\% for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.83 [95\\% CI, 0.74-0.93]; P =.001), and 49.9\\% vs 69.5\\% for AF recurrence (HR, 0.52 [95\\% CI, 0.45-0.60]; P {$<$}.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower-than-expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/D9LLXBUF/2019_Packer et al._Effect of Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy on Mortality, Stroke, Bleeding, and Cardiac Arrest among P.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173657,"version":0},"$loki":962},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1829,"entry":"@article{Palacios2020,\n  title = {Percutaneous Mitral Balloon Valvuloplasty - State of the Art},\n  author = {Palacios, Igor F.},\n  date = {2020-10-24},\n  journaltitle = {Mini-invasive Surgery},\n  volume = {2020},\n  publisher = {{OAE Publishing Inc.}},\n  doi = {10.20517/2574-1225.2020.72},\n  url = {https://misjournal.net/article/view/3725},\n  urldate = {2021-10-17},\n  abstract = {This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, for any purpose, even commercially, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made. Abstract Since its introduction in 1982, percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMV) has been used successfully as an alternative to open or closed surgical mitral commissurotomy in the treatment of patients with symptomatic rheumatic mitral stenosis. PMV is safe and effective and provides sustained clinical and hemodynamic improvement in patients with mitral stenosis. The immediate and long-term results appear to be similar to those of surgical mitral commissurotomy. Proper patient selection is an essential step for being able to predict the immediate results of PMV. Candidates for PMV require precise assessment of the mitral valve morphology. The Wilkin's echocardiographic score (Echo-Sc) is currently the most widely used method for predicting PMV outcome. Leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, valvular calcification, and sub valvular disease are each scored from 1 to 4. An inverse relationship exists between the Echo-Sc and PMV success. Both immediate and intermediate follow-up studies have shown that patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8 have superior results, significantly greater survival, and event free survival compared to patients with Echo-Sc {$>$} 8. We identified other clinical and morphologic predictors of PMV success that include age, pre-PMV mitral valve area, history of previous surgical commissurotomy, and mitral regurgitation (MR), and post-PMV variables (e.g., post-PMV MR ≥ 3 + and pulmonary artery pressure), that may be used in conjunction with the Echo-Sc to optimally identify candidates for PMV. This concept demonstrates a multifactorial nature of the prediction of immediate and long-term results. Other echocardiographic scores have been developed for the screening of potential candidates for PMV. They include a unique score that take into account the length of the chordae. A novel quantitative score that included the ratio of the commissural areas over the maximal excursion of the leaflets from the annulus in diastole. The components of this score include mitral valve area ≤ 1 cm 2 , maximum leaflet displacement ≤ 12 mm, commissural area ratio ≥ 1.25, and sub valvular involvement. Finally, a score that is able to identify patients who are more Page 2 of 24 Palacios Mini-invasive Surg 2020;4:73 I http://dx.doi.org/10.20517/2574-1225.2020.72 likely to develop significant mitral regurgitation post-PMV. This score takes into account the distribution (even or uneven) of leaflet thickening and calcification, the degree and symmetry of commissural disease, and the severity of subvalvular disease. The transvenous transseptal approach is the most widely used PMV technique. The two major techniques of PMV are the double-balloon technique and the Inoue technique which are equally effective techniques of PMV. Encouraging results of PMV have been reported in special mitral stenosis population cohorts including pregnant women, patients with previous surgical commissurotomy, patients with atrial fibrillation, patients with pulmonary hypertension, elderly patients, patients with calcific mitral stenosis, and patients with associated aortic regurgitation. To summarize, PMV is the preferred form of therapy for relief of mitral stenosis for a selected group of patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis and suitable valve anatomy for valvuloplasty. Patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8 have the best results, particularly if they are young, are in normal sinus rhythm, have no pulmonary hypertension, and have no evidence of calcification of the mitral valve under fluoroscopy. The immediate and long-term results of PMV in this group of patients are similar to those reported after surgical mitral commissurotomy. Patients with Echo-Sc {$>$} 8 have only a 50\\% chance to obtain a successful hemodynamic result with PMV, and the long-term follow-up results are worse than those from patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8. In patients with Echo-Sc ≥ 12, it is unlikely that PMV could produce good immediate or long-term results and they preferably should undergo mitral valve replacement. However, PMV could be considered in these patients if they are high-risk or unqualified surgical candidates.},\n  keywords = {mitral balloon valvuloplasty,Mitral stenosis,rheumatic mitral stenosis},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ARDJZSML/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173664,"version":0},"$loki":963},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":45,"entry":"@article{Pangaro2013,\n  title = {Frameworks for Learner Assessment in Medicine: {{AMEE Guide No}}. 78},\n  author = {Pangaro, Louis and Ten Cate, Olle},\n  date = {2013-06-16},\n  journaltitle = {Medical Teacher},\n  volume = {35},\n  number = {6},\n  eprint = {23676179},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {e1197-e1210},\n  publisher = {{Taylor \\& Francis}},\n  issn = {0142159X},\n  doi = {10.3109/0142159X.2013.788789},\n  url = {http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/0142159X.2013.788789},\n  urldate = {2018-03-12},\n  abstract = {In any evaluation system of medical trainees there is an underlying set of assumptions about what is to be evaluated (i.e., which goals reflect the values of the system or institution), what kind of observations or assessments are useful to allow judgments 1 ; and how these are to be analyzed and compared to a standard of what is to be achieved by the learner. These assumptions can be conventionalized into a framework for evaluation. Frameworks encompass, or \"frame,\" a group of ideas or categories to reflect the educational goals against which a trainee's level of competence or progress is gauged. Different frameworks provide different ways of looking at the practice of medicine and have different purposes. In the first place, frameworks should enable educators to determine to what extent trainees are ready for advancement, that is, whether the desired competence has been attained. They should provide both a valid mental model of competence and also terms to describe successful performance, either at the end of training or as milestones during the curriculum. Consequently, such frameworks drive learning by providing learners with a guide for what is expected. Frameworks should also enhance consistency and reliability of ratings across staff and settings. Finally, they determine the content of, and resources needed for, rater training to achieve consistency of use. This is especially important in clinical rotations, in which reliable assessments have been most difficult to achieve. Because the limitations of workplace-based assessment have persisted despite the use of traditional frameworks (such as those based on knowledge, skills, and attitudes), this Guide will explore the assumptions and characteristics of traditional and newer frameworks. In this AMEE Guide, we make a distinction between analytic, synthetic, and developmental frameworks. Analytic frameworks deconstruct competence into individual pieces, to evaluate each separately.

Severe PPM occurs in 2\\% to 20\\% of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is associated with 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in the risk of mortality and heart failure rehospitalization. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of the role of multimodality imaging in the assessment, prediction, prevention, and management of PPM following AVR. The risk of PPM can be anticipated at the time of AVR by calculating the predicted indexed from the normal reference value of EOA of the selected prosthesis and patient's body surface area. The strategies to prevent PPM at the time of surgical AVR include: 1) implanting a newer generation of prosthetic valve with better hemodynamic; 2) enlarging the aortic root or annulus to accommodate a larger prosthetic valve; or 3) performing TAVR rather than surgical AVR. The identification and quantitation of PPM as well as its distinction versus prosthetic valve stenosis is primarily based on transthoracic echocardiography, but important information may be obtained from other imaging modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography. PPM is characterized by high transprosthetic velocity and gradients, normal EOA, small indexed EOA, and normal leaflet morphology and mobility. Transesophageal echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography are particularly helpful to assess prosthetic valve leaflet morphology and mobility, which is a cornerstone of the differential diagnosis between PPM and pathologic valve obstruction. Severe symptomatic PPM following AVR with a bioprosthetic valve may be treated by redo surgery or the transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure with fracturing of the surgical valve stent.},\n  keywords = {aortic valve replacement,bioprosthesis,Doppler echocardiography,multidetector computed tomography,prosthesis-patient mismatch},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/HVRSZDSX/j.jcmg.2018.10.020.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173676,"version":0},"$loki":967},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":389,"entry":"@article{Pisters2010,\n  title = {A Novel User-Friendly Score ({{HAS-BLED}}) to Assess 1-Year Risk of Major Bleeding in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: {{The}} Euro Heart Survey},\n  author = {Pisters, Ron and Lane, Deirdre A. and Nieuwlaat, Robby and De Vos, Cees B. and Crijns, Harry J.G.M. and Lip, Gregory Y.H.},\n  date = {2010-11},\n  journaltitle = {Chest},\n  volume = {138},\n  number = {5},\n  eprint = {20299623},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1093--1100},\n  issn = {19313543},\n  doi = {10.1378/chest.10-0134},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20299623},\n  urldate = {2018-07-14},\n  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Despite extensive use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the increased bleeding risk associated with such OAC use, no handy quantification tool for assessing this risk exists. We aimed to develop a practical risk score to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding (intracranial, hospitalization, hemoglobin decrease {$>$} 2 g/L, and/or transfusion) in a cohort of real-world patients with AF. METHODS Based on 3,978 patients in the Euro Heart Survey on AF with complete follow-up, all univariate bleeding risk factors in this cohort were used in a multivariate analysis along with historical bleeding risk factors. A new bleeding risk score termed HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly ({$>$} 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) was calculated, incorporating risk factors from the derivation cohort. RESULTS Fifty-three (1.5\\%) major bleeds occurred during 1-year follow-up. The annual bleeding rate increased with increasing risk factors. The predictive accuracy in the overall population using significant risk factors in the derivation cohort (C statistic 0.72) was consistent when applied in several subgroups. Application of the new bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) gave similar C statistics except where patients were receiving antiplatelet agents alone or no antithrombotic therapy, with C statistics of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. CONCLUSION This simple, novel bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) provides a practical tool to assess the individual bleeding risk of real-world patients with AF, potentially supporting clinical decision making regarding antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF.},\n  isbn = {1931-3543 (Electronic)\\textbackslash r0012-3692 (Linking)}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173679,"version":0},"$loki":968},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2043,"entry":"@article{Porter2004,\n  title = {Influence of Age and Gender on the Mechanism of Supraventricular Tachycardia},\n  author = {Porter, Michael J. and Morton, Joseph B. and Denman, Russell and Lin, Albert C. and Tierney, Sean and Santucci, Peter A. and Cai, John J. and Madsen, Nathaniel and Wilber, David J.},\n  date = {2004-10-01},\n  journaltitle = {Heart Rhythm},\n  volume = {1},\n  number = {4},\n  eprint = {15851189},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {393--396},\n  publisher = {{Elsevier}},\n  issn = {15475271},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.05.007},\n  abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the impact of age and gender on the mechanism of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Background: Previous studies have indicated that PSVT mechanism may be influenced by age and gender, but contemporary data are limited. Methods: In 1,754 patients undergoing catheter ablation of 1,856 PSVTs between 1991 and 2003, the mechanism was classified as atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), or atrial tachycardia (AT). Patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and age {$<$}5 years were excluded. Results: The mean age was 45 ± 19 years (range 5-96), and the majority were women (62\\%). Overall, AVNRT was the predominant mechanism (n = 1,042 [56\\%]), followed by AVRT (n = 500 [27\\%]) and AT (n = 315 [17\\%]). There was a strong relationship between age and PSVT mechanism; the proportion of AVRT in both sexes decreased with age, whereas AVNRT and AT increased (PM .001 by ANOVA). The majority of patients with AVRT were men (273/500 [54.6\\%]), whereas the majority of patients with AVNRT and AT were women (727/1,042 [70\\%] and 195/315 [62\\%], respectively). The distribution of PSVT mechanism was significantly influenced by gender (P {$<$} .001). In women, 63\\% had AVNRT, 20\\% had AVRT, and 17.0\\% had AT. In men, 45\\% had AVNRT, 39\\% had AVRT, and 17\\% had AT. AVNRT replaced AVRT as the dominant PSVT mechanism at age 40 in men and at age 10 in women.

The changes of the intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure associated with the manoeuvre result in a complex cardiovascular response with a concomitant action of several regulatory mechanisms. As the main aim of the reflex mechanisms is to control the arterial blood pressure (BP), their action is based primarily on signals from baroreceptors, although they also reflect the activity of pulmonary stretch receptors and, to a lower degree, chemoreceptors, with different mechanisms acting either in synergism or in antagonism depending on the phase of the manoeuvre. A variety of abnormal responses to the VM can be seen in patients with different conditions. Based on the arterial BP and heart rate changes during and after the manoeuvre several dysfunctions can be hence diagnosed or confirmed. The nature of the cardiovascular response to the manoeuvre depends, however, not only on the shape of the cardiovascular system and the autonomic function of the given patient, but also on a number of technical factors related to the execution of the manoeuvre including the duration and level of strain, the body position or breathing pattern. This review of the literature provides a~comprehensive analysis of the physiology and pathophysiology of the VM and an overview of its applications.

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel cardioversion protocol for this arrhythmia. Methods and results: Consecutive elective cardioversion attempts for AF between October 2012 and July 2017 at a tertiary cardiovascular centre before (Phase I) and after (Phase II) implementing the Ottawa AF cardioversion protocol (OAFCP) as an institutional initiative in July 2015 were evaluated. The primary outcome was cardioversion success, defined as ≥2 consecutive sinus beats or atrial-paced beats in patients with implanted cardiac devices. Secondary outcomes were first shock success, sustained success (sinus or atrial-paced rhythm on 12-lead electrocardiogram prior to discharge from hospital), and procedural complications. Cardioversion was successful in 459/500 (91.8\\%) in Phase I compared with 386/389 (99.2\\%) in Phase II (P {$<$} 0.001). This improvement persisted after adjusting for age, body mass index, amiodarone use, and transthoracic impedance using modified Poisson regression [adjusted relative risk 1.08, 95\\% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.11; P {$<$} 0.001] and when analysed as an interrupted time series (change in level +9.5\\%, 95\\% CI 6.8-12.1\\%; P {$<$} 0.001).

Conclusion: Implementing the OAFCP was associated with a 7.4\\% absolute increase in cardioversion success and increases in first shock and sustained success without serious procedural complications.

OBJECTIVE: We explored barriers and facilitators that residents in anesthesiology, emergency medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgery experience with giving and receiving feedback during their clinical training. METHODS: Residents from 3 geographically diverse teaching institutions were recruited to participate in focus groups in 2012. Open-ended questions prompted residents to describe their experiences with giving and receiving feedback, and discuss facilitators and barriers. Data were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method associated with a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: A total of 19 residents participated in 1 of 3 focus groups. Five major themes related to feedback were identified: teacher factors, learner factors, feedback process, feedback content, and educational context. Unapproachable attendings, time pressures due to clinical work, and discomfort with giving negative feedback were cited as major barriers in the feedback process. Learner engagement in the process was a major facilitator in the feedback process. CONCLUSIONS: Residents provided insights for improving the feedback process based on their dual roles as teachers and learners. Time pressures in the learning environment may be mitigated by efforts to improve the quality of teacher-learner relationships. Forms for collecting written feedback should be augmented by faculty development to ensure meaningful use. Efforts to improve residents' comfort with giving feedback and encouraging learners to engage in the feedback process may foster an environment conducive to increasing feedback.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7X8LHW6N/m-api-4ede82da-e2e5-ca47-5296-c976bd075d79.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173694,"version":0},"$loki":972},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1017,"entry":"@article{Ringqvist1983,\n  title = {Prognostic Value of Angiographic Indices of Coronary Artery Disease from the {{Coronary Artery Surgery Study}} ({{CASS}})},\n  author = {Ringqvist, I. and Fisher, L.

This approach is based in part on data indicating that atrial fibrillation is a predictor of death in patients with heart failure and suggesting that the suppression of atrial fibrillation may favorably affect the outcome. However, the benefits and risks of this approach have not been adequately studied. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm control) with control of the ventricular rate (rate control) in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35\\% or less, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome was the time to death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: A total of 1376 patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm-control group and 694 in the rate-control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. Of these patients, 182 (27\\%) in the rhythm-control group died from cardiovascular causes, as compared with 175 (25\\%) in the rate-control group (hazard ratio in the rhythm-control group, 1.06; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P = 0.59 by the log-rank test). Secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups, including death from any cause (32\\% in the rhythm-control group and 33\\% in the rate-control group), stroke (3\\% and 4\\%, respectively), worsening heart failure (28\\% and 31\\%), and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or worsening heart failure (43\\% and 46\\%). There were also no significant differences favoring either strategy in any predefined subgroup.

Hypothesis: Neck fullness and witnessed neck pulsations have a high positive predictive value in the diagnosis of typical AVNRT. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with palpitations presenting to a single electrophysiology (EP) laboratory over a 1 year period. Each patient underwent a standard questionnaire regarding neck fullness and/or witnessed neck pulsations during their palpitations. The reference standard for diagnosis was determined by electrocardiogram and invasive EP studies. Results: Comparing typical AVNRT to atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) patients, the proportions with neck fullness and witnessed neck pulsations did not significantly differ: in the best case scenario (using the upper end of the 95\\%confidence interval (CI), none of the positive or negative predictive values exceeded 79\\%. After restricting the population to those with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) other than AF or AFL, neck fullness again exhibited poor test characteristics; however, witnessed neck pulsations exhibited a specificity of 97\\% (95\\% CI: 90\\%-100\\%) and a positive predictive value of 83\\% (95\\% CI: 52\\%-98\\%). After adjustment for potential confounders, SVT patients with witnessed neck pulsations had a seven-fold greater odds of having typical AVNRT, p = 0.029.

We sought to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients who are subjects of rapid response team calls and to develop and validate a predictive model for death after rapid response team call. Design: Analysis of data from the national Get with the Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team event registry. Setting: Two-hundred seventy four hospitals participating in Get with the Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team from June 2005 to February 2015. Patients: 282,710 hospitalized adults on surgical or medical wards who were subjects of a rapid response team call. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was death during hospitalization; candidate predictors included patient demographic- and event-level characteristics. Patients who died after rapid response team were older (median age 72 vs 66 yr), were more likely to be admitted for noncardiac medical illness (70\\% vs 58\\%), and had greater median length of stay prior to rapid response team (81 vs 47 hr) (p {$<$} 0.001 for all comparisons).

Conclusions: Patients who die following rapid response team calls differ significantly from surviving peers.

The pacing threshold and electrogram amplitude that best determines EUS is unknown. Methods and Results - The change in dimension of the virtual electrode was estimated in 11 patients and observed to increase by 4.4±2.5 mm as stimulus strength increases from threshold (2.9±1.8 mA) to 10 mA. EUS was defined as a threshold {$>$} 10 mA. In 14 consecutive patients, mapping and ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were performed using an electroanatomic mapping system. During sinus rhythm, unipolar pacing was performed at sites with bipolar electrogram amplitude {$<$} 1.5 mV. EUS regions were marked on the maps. Reentry circuit isthmuses were identified by entrainment mapping or pace mapping, and ablation was performed. EUS was identified in the infarct in all 14 patients (11.8±13.9 cm2). All 20 VT circuit isthmuses identified were adjacent to EUS. Although electrogram amplitude correlated with pacing threshold (r=0.64, P{$<$}0.0001), many isthmuses had very low-amplitude electrograms, and EUS could not be identified from electrogram amplitude alone. RF ablation lines connecting selected EUS regions abolished all inducible VTs in 10 patients (71\\%); spontaneous VT was markedly reduced during follow-up (from 142±360 to 0.9±2.0 episodes per month, P=0.002).

SETTING: Four teaching hospitals associated with a large public medical school. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six attending physicians and 279 trainees treating 807 general medicine inpatients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Duration and location of rounds, composition of teams, and frequency of 19 potential activities during rounds. RESULTS: We observed 90 days of rounds. A typical rounding day consisted of 1 attending with 3 trainees visiting a median of 9 (range, 2-18 [SD, 2.9]) patients for a median of 2.0 hours (range, 25-241 [SD, 2.7] minutes). On rounds, teams most frequently discussed the patient care plan (96.7\\% of patients), reviewed diagnostic studies (90.7\\%), communicated with patients (73.4\\%), and discussed the medication list (68.8\\%). Teams infrequently discussed invasive lines or tubes (9.3\\%) or nursing notes (6.2\\%) and rarely communicated with nurses (12.0\\%) or taught physical examination skills (14.6\\%), evidence-based medicine topics (7.2\\%), or learner-identified topics (3.2\\%). Many commonly performed activities occurred infrequently at the bedside. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most activities on attending rounds do not take place at the bedside. The teams discuss patient care plans and test results most of the time but fail to include many items that may be of significant value, including specific aspects of patient care, interprofessional communication, and learner-centered education. Future studies are needed to further assess the implications of these observations.},\n  isbn = {2168-6114},\n  keywords = {participation in ward rounds,physical examination},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/9K3SNVXU/2013_Stickrath et al._Attending Rounds in the Current Era.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173820,"version":0},"$loki":989},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1726,"entry":"@article{Stone2018,\n  title = {Transcatheter {{Mitral-Valve Repair}} in {{Patients}} with {{Heart Failure}}},\n  author = {Stone, Gregg W. and Lindenfeld, JoAnn and Abraham, William T. and Kar, Saibal and Lim, D.

Transcatheter mitral-valve repair may improve their clinical outcomes. METHODS At 78 sites in the United States and Canada, we enrolled patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to transcatheter mitral-valve repair plus medical therapy (device group) or medical therapy alone (control group). The primary effectiveness end point was all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months of follow-up. The primary safety end point was freedom from device-related complications at 12 months; the rate for this end point was compared with a prespecified objective performance goal of 88.0\\%. RESULTS Of the 614 patients who were enrolled in the trial, 302 were assigned to the device group and 312 to the control group. The annualized rate of all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months was 35.8\\% per patient-year in the device group as compared with 67.9\\% per patient-year in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.70; P{$<$}0.001). The rate of freedom from device-related complications at 12 months was 96.6\\% (lower 95\\% confidence limit, 94.8\\%; P{$<$}0.001 for comparison with the performance goal). Death from any cause within 24 months occurred in 29.1\\% of the patients in the device group as compared with 46.1\\% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\\% CI, 0.46 to 0.82; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy, transcatheter mitral-valve repair resulted in a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure and lower all-cause mortality within 24 months of follow-up than medical therapy alone. The rate of freedom from device-related complications exceeded a prespecified safety threshold.

Methods Patients admitted for AHF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40\\%, dyspnea, and elevated plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides were randomized to receive a double-blind, 48-h intravenous infusion of placebo or OM in 3 sequential, escalating-dose cohorts. Results In 606 patients, OM did not improve the primary endpoint of dyspnea relief (3 OM dose groups and pooled placebo: placebo, 41\\%; OM cohort 1, 42\\%; cohort 2, 47\\%; cohort 3, 51\\%; p = 0.33) or any of the secondary outcomes studied. In supplemental, pre-specified analyses, OM resulted in greater dyspnea relief at 48 h (placebo, 37\\% vs. OM, 51\\%; p = 0.034) and through 5 days (p = 0.038) in the high-dose cohort. OM exerted plasma concentration-related increases in left ventricular systolic ejection time (p {$<$} 0.0001) and decreases in end-systolic dimension (p {$<$} 0.05). The adverse event profile and tolerability of OM were similar to those of placebo, without increases in ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Plasma troponin concentrations were higher in OM-treated patients compared with placebo (median difference at 48 h, 0.004 ng/ml), but with no obvious relationship with OM concentration (p = 0.95). Conclusions In patients with AHF, intravenous OM did not meet the primary endpoint of dyspnea improvement, but it was generally well tolerated, it increased systolic ejection time, and it may have improved dyspnea in the high-dose group.

Patients were randomly assigned equally, via an interactive web response system, to receive 25 mg oral omecamtiv mecarbil twice daily (fixed-dose group), 25 mg twice daily titrated to 50 mg twice daily guided by pharmacokinetics (pharmacokinetic-titration group), or placebo for 20 weeks. We assessed the maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil in plasma (primary endpoint) and changes in cardiac function and ventricular diameters. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01786512. Findings From March 17, 2014, to March 5, 2015, we enrolled 150 patients in the fixed-dose omecamtiv mecarbil group and 149 in the pharmacokinetic-titration and placebo groups. Mean maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil at 12 weeks was 200 (SD 71) ng/mL in the fixed-dose group and 318 (129) ng/mL in the pharmacokinetic-titration group. For the pharmacokinetic-titration group versus placebo group at 20 weeks, least square mean differences were as follows: systolic ejection time 25 ms (95\\% CI 18–32, p{$<$}0·0001), stroke volume 3·6 mL (0·5–6·7, p=0·0217), left ventricular end-systolic diameter −1·8 mm (−2·9 to −0·6, p=0·0027), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter −1·3 mm, (−2·3 to 0·3, p=0·0128), heart rate −3·0 beats per min (−5·1 to −0·8, p=0·0070), and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide concentration in plasma −970 pg/mL (−1672 to −268, p=0·0069).

Prior attempts at increasing cardiac contractility with oral drugs have uniformly resulted in signals of increased mortality at pharmacologically effective doses. Omecamtiv mecarbil is a novel, selective cardiac myosin activator that has been shown to improve cardiac function and to decrease ventricular volumes, heart rate, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure) trial tests the hypotheses that omecamtiv mecarbil can safely improve symptoms, prevent clinical HF events, and delay CV death in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial. More than 8,000 patients with chronic symptomatic (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) HF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35\\%, elevated natriuretic peptides, and either current hospitalization for HF or history of hospitalization or emergency department visit for HF within a year of screening will be randomized to either oral placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil employing a pharmacokinetic-guided dose titration strategy using doses of 25, 37.5, or 50 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy outcome is the time to cardiovascular death or first HF event. The study has 90\\% power to assess a final hazard ratio of approximately 0.80 in cardiovascular death, the first secondary outcome.

A false tendon has been described in the left ventricle in a patient with ILVT in whom surgical resection of the false tendon resulted in cure. We hypothesized that the false tendon is responsible for the genesis of similar ventricular tachycardia (VT) in others. Methods and Results: We performed transthoracic (TTE) and/or transesophageal (TEE) two-dimensional echocardiograms in 15 patients undergoing catheter ablation for ILVT. There were 12 men and 3 women (mean age, 31 ± 12 years, with average symptom duration of 11 ± 9 years). The mean VT cycle length was 36 ± 70 ms, and all had RBBB morphology with left axis deviation. Cardiac chamber sizes, left ventricular wall thickness, and wall motion were normal in all ILVT patients. TTE and/or TEE demonstrated a false tendon extending from the posteroinferior left ventricular free wall to the left ventricular septum in all ILVT patients. The false tendons were thick (≥2 mm maximal thickness) in 5 patients and thin ({$<$}2 mm maximal thickness) in 10 patients. We compared ILVT patients with a control group of 671 consecutive patients referred for echocardiography for other reasons. The mean age for the control group was 42 years. A false tendon was seen in the left ventricle in 34 of 671 (5\\%). In the control group patients with a false tendon, 2 patients had a history of VT (left bundle-branch block morphology) and 1 had ventricular fibrillation. The false tendons in the control patients were also oriented transversely across the ventricular cavity but were somewhat thinner ({$<$}2 mm maximal thickness in 32 of 34 patients). Catheter ablation with the use of radiofrequency and/or direct current applied to the posteroapical septum resulted in cure in 14 of 15 patients. Conclusions: A false tendon extending from the posteroinferior left ventricle to the septum is a consistent finding in patients with ILVT and probably is responsible for this unique arrhythmia. The mechanism by which the false tendon precipitates tachycardia is speculative, but possibilities include conduction through the false tendon or by producing stretch in the Purkinje fiber network on the interventricular septum.},\n  keywords = {ablation,false tendon,tachycardia}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173861,"version":0},"$loki":997},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1854,"entry":"@article{Thomas2019,\n  title = {Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation Detection with a Floating Atrial Sensing Dipole in Single Lead Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Systems: {{Results}} of the {{SENSE}} Trial},\n  author = {Thomas, George and Choi, Daniel Y. and Doppalapudi, Harish and Richards, Mark and Iwai, Sei and Daoud, Emile G. and Houmsse, Mahmoud and Kanagasundram, Arvindh N. and Mainigi, Sumeet K. and Lubitz, Steven A. and Cheung, Jim W.},\n  date = {2019-10-01},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology},\n  volume = {30},\n  number = {10},\n  eprint = {31328298},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {1994--2001},\n  publisher = {{J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol}},\n  issn = {15408167},\n  doi = {10.1111/jce.14081},\n  url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328298/},\n  urldate = {2021-11-07},\n  abstract = {Introduction: Subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF), in the form of cardiac implantable device-detected atrial high rate episodes (AHREs), has been associated with increased thromboembolism. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead with a floating atrial dipole may permit a single lead (DX) ICD system to detect AHREs. We sought to assess the utility of the DX ICD system for subclinical AF detection in patients, with a prospective multicenter, cohort-controlled trial. Methods and Results: One hundred fifty patients without prior history of AF (age 59 ± 13 years; 108 [72\\%] male) were enrolled into the DX cohort and implanted with a Biotronik DX ICD system at eight centers. Age-, sex-, and left ventricular ejection fraction-matched single- and dual-chamber ICD cohorts were derived from a Cornell database and from the IMPACT trial, respectively. The primary endpoint were AHRE detection at 12 months. During median 12 months follow-up, AHREs were detected in 19 (13\\%) patients in the DX, 8 (5.3\\%) in the single-chamber, and 19 (13\\%) in the dual-chamber cohorts. The rate of AHRE detection was significantly higher in the DX cohort compared to the single-chamber cohort (P =.026), but not significantly different compared to the dual-chamber cohort. There were no inappropriate ICD therapies in the DX cohort. At 12 months, only 3.0\\% of patients in the DX cohort had sensed atrial amplitudes less than 1.0 mV. Conclusion: Use of a DX ICD lead allows subclinical AF detection with a single lead DX system that is superior to that of a conventional single-chamber ICD system.},\n  keywords = {implantable cardioverter-defibrillator,remote monitoring,subclinical atrial fibrillation},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/P2U8QMJU/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173866,"version":0},"$loki":998},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1661,"entry":"@article{Torp-Pedersen1999,\n  title = {Dofetilide in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Dysfunction},\n  author = {Torp-Pedersen, Christian and Møller, Mogens and Bloch-Thomsen, Poul Erik and Køber, Lars and Sandøe, Erik and Egstrup, Kenneth and Agner, Erik and Carlsen, Jan and Videbæk, Jørgen and Marchant, Bradley and Camm, A.

Sinus rhythm may be maintained with antiarrhythmic drugs, but some of these drugs increase the risk of death. Methods: We studied 1518 patients-with symptomatic congestive heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction at 34 Danish hospitals. We randomly assigned 762 patients to receive dofetilide, a novel class III antiarrhythmic agent, and 756 to receive placebo in a double-blind study. Treatment was initiated in the hospital and included three days of cardiac monitoring and dose adjustment. The primary end point was death from any cause. Results: During a median follow-up of 18 months, 311 patients in the dofetilide group (41 percent) and 317 patients in the placebo group (42 percent) died (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.11). Treatment with dofetilide significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for worsening congestive heart failure (risk ratio, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.89). Dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. After one month, 22 of 190 patients with atrial fibrillation at base line (12 percent) had sinus rhythm restored with dofetilide, as compared with only 3 of 201 patients (1 percent) given placebo. Once sinus rhythm was restored, dofetilide was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm (hazard ratio for the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, 0.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.57; P{$<$}0.001). There were 25 cases of torsade de pointes in the dofetilide group (3.3 percent) as corn pared with none in the placebo group. Conclusions: In patients with congestive heart failure and reduced left ventricular function, dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation, preventing its recurrence, and reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure.

Procedural strategies beyond pulmonary vein isolation have failed to consistently improve results. The vein of Marshall contains innervation and AF triggers that can be ablated by retrograde ethanol infusion. Objective: To determine whether vein of Marshall ethanol infusion could improve ablation results in persistent AF when added to catheter ablation. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Vein of Marshall Ethanol for Untreated Persistent AF (VENUS) trial was an investigator-initiated, National Institutes of Health-funded, randomized, single-blinded trial conducted in 12 centers in the United States. Patients (N = 350) with persistent AF referred for first ablation were enrolled from October 2013 through June 2018. Follow-up concluded in June 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to catheter ablation alone (n = 158) or catheter ablation combined with vein of Marshall ethanol infusion (n = 185) in a 1:1.15 ratio to accommodate for 15\\% technical vein of Marshall ethanol infusion failures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was freedom from AF or atrial tachycardia for longer than 30 seconds after a single procedure, without antiarrhythmic drugs, at both 6 and 12 months. Outcome assessment was blinded to randomization treatment. There were 12 secondary outcomes, including AF burden, freedom from AF after multiple procedures, perimitral block, and others. Results: Of the 343 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [9.7] years; 261 men), 316 (92.1\\%) completed the trial. Vein of Marshall ethanol was successfully delivered in 155 of 185 patients. At 6 and 12 months, the proportion of patients with freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia after a single procedure was 49.2\\% (91/185) in the catheter ablation combined with vein of Marshall ethanol infusion group compared with 38\\% (60/158) in the catheter ablation alone group (difference, 11.2\\% [95\\% CI, 0.8\\%-21.7\\%]; P =.04). Of the 12 secondary outcomes, 9 were not significantly different, but AF burden (zero burden in 78.3\\% vs 67.9\\%; difference, 10.4\\% [95\\% CI, 2.9\\%-17.9\\%]; P =.01), freedom from AF after multiple procedures (65.2\\% vs 53.8\\%; difference, 11.4\\% [95\\% CI, 0.6\\%-22.2\\%]; P =.04), and success achieving perimitral block (80.6\\% vs 51.3\\%; difference, 29.3\\% [95\\% CI, 19.3\\%-39.3\\%]; P {$<$}.001) were significantly improved in vein of Marshall-treated patients. Adverse events were similar between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with persistent AF, addition of vein of Marshall ethanol infusion to catheter ablation, compared with catheter ablation alone, increased the likelihood of remaining free of AF or atrial tachycardia at 6 and 12 months. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy.

METHODS AND RESULTS All electrocardiograms (ECGs) in patients {$>$}18~years with sinus rhythm, normal QRS duration and rate {$<$}90~beats per minute (bpm) in the University Hospitals of Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) during a 2-month period were included. QT correction was performed with Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, Hodges, and Rautaharju formulae. In total, 6609 patients were included (age, 59.8±16.2~years; 53.6\\% male and heart rate 68.8±10.6~bpm). Optimal rate correction was observed using Fridericia and Framingham; Bazett performed worst. A healthy subset showed 99\\% upper limits of normal for Bazett above current clinical standards: men 472~ms (95\\% CI, 464-478~ms) and women 482~ms (95\\% CI 474-490~ms). Multivariate Cox regression, including age, heart rate, and prolonged QTc, identified Framingham (hazard ratio [HR], 7.31; 95\\% CI, 4.10-13.05) and Fridericia (HR, 5.95; 95\\% CI, 3.34-10.60) as significantly better predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality than Bazett (HR, 4.49; 95\\% CI, 2.31-8.74). In a point-prevalence study with haloperidol, the number of patients classified to be at risk for possibly harmful QT prolongation could be reduced by 50\\% using optimal QT rate correction. CONCLUSIONS Fridericia and Framingham correction formulae showed the best rate correction and significantly improved prediction of 30-day and 1-year mortality. With current clinical standards, Bazett overestimated the number of patients with potential dangerous QTc prolongation, which could lead to unnecessary safety measurements as withholding the patient of first-choice medication.},\n  isbn = {2047-9980},\n  keywords = {Electrocardiography,Mortality,Population,QT interval electrocardiography,Risk factors,Risk prediction},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7GMMJUE9/2016-qt-formula.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173891,"version":0},"$loki":1004},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1791,"entry":"@article{VanderLingen2021,\n  title = {Reversible {{Cause}} of {{Cardiac Arrest}} and {{Secondary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators}} in {{Patients With Coronary Artery Disease}}: {{Value}} of {{Complete Revascularization}} and {{LGE-CMR}}.},\n  author = {family=Lingen, given=Anne-Lotte C J, prefix=van der, useprefix=true and Becker, Marthe A J and Kemme, Michiel J B and Rijnierse, Mischa T and Spoormans, Eva M and Timmer, Stefan A J and family=Rossum, given=Albert C, prefix=van, useprefix=true and family=Halm, given=Vokko P, prefix=van, useprefix=true and Germans, Tjeerd and Allaart, Cornelis P},\n  date = {2021-04-06},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of the American Heart Association},\n  volume = {10},\n  eprint = {33821672},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {e019101},\n  issn = {2047-9980},\n  doi = {10.1161/JAHA.120.019101},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821672},\n  urldate = {2021-04-18},\n  abstract = {Background In survivors of sudden cardiac arrest with obstructive coronary artery disease, it remains challenging to distinguish ischemia as a reversible cause from irreversible scar-related ventricular arrhythmias.

Methods and Results This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 276 patients (80\\% men, age 67±10 years) receiving ICD implantation for secondary prevention. Angiography was performed before ICD implantation. A subgroup of 166 (60\\%) patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement before implantation.

It is unknown whether an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is mandatory in these patients as VA might be triggered by a reversible cause. The purpose of this study is to analyze the benefit of ICD therapy in this patient population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in ICD recipients implanted from 2008 to 2011. The study group consisted of patients with sustained VA in the setting of an ACS, with a history of MI, but with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 35 (group A). The two control groups consisted of patients admitted with VA with a history of MI, but without ACS at presentation, either with LVEF greater than 35\\% (group B) or ≤35\\% (group C). The primary endpoint was the number of patients with appropriate ICD therapy (antitachycardia pacing or shock). Results: A total of 291 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 5.3 years. Appropriate ICD therapy occurred in 45.6\\% of the patients in group A vs 51.6\\% and 60.4\\% in groups B and C (P =.11).

Whether the initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy is safe and effective among patients who are hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure at 129 sites in the United States. After hemodynamic stabilization, patients were randomly assigned to receive sacubitril-valsartan (target dose, 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or enalapril (target dose, 10 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy outcome was the time-averaged proportional change in the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration from baseline through weeks 4 and 8. Key safety outcomes were the rates of worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, and angioedema. RESULTS: Of the 881 patients who underwent randomization, 440 were assigned to receive sacubitril-valsartan and 441 to receive enalapril. The time-averaged reduction in the NT-proBNP concentration was significantly greater in the sacubitril-valsartan group than in the enalapril group; the ratio of the geometric mean of values obtained at weeks 4 and 8 to the baseline value was 0.53 in the sacubitril-valsartan group as compared with 0.75 in the enalapril group (percent change, −46.7\\% vs. −25.3\\%; ratio of change with sacubitril-valsartan vs. enalapril, 0.71; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.81; P{$<$}0.001). The greater reduction in the NT-proBNP concentration with sacubitril-valsartan than with enalapril was evident as early as week 1 (ratio of change, 0.76; 95\\% CI, 0.69 to 0.85). The rates of worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, and angioedema did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure, the initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy led to a greater reduction in the NT-proBNP concentration than enalapril therapy.

This can occur suddenly in a previously healthy heart due to massive pulmonary embolism or right-sided myocardial infarction, but many cases encountered in the intensive care unit involve worsening of compensated RV failure in the setting of chronic heart and lung disease. Management of RV failure is directed at optimizing right-sided filling pressures and reducing afterload. Due to a lower level of vascular tone, vasoactive medications have less salient effects on reducing vascular resistance in the pulmonary than in the systemic circulation. Successful management requires reversal of any conditions that heighten pulmonary vascular tone and the use of selective pulmonary vasodilators at doses that do not induce systemic hypotension or worsening of oxygenation. Systemic systolic arterial pressure should be kept close to RV systolic pressure to maintain RV perfusion.

Echocardiography provides an important opportunity to evaluate for constrictive pericarditis, and defnite diagnostic criteria are needed. Methods and Results-Patients with surgically confrmed constrictive pericarditis (n=130) at Mayo Clinic (2008-2010) were compared with patients (n=36) diagnosed with restrictive myocardial disease or severe tricuspid regurgitation after constrictive pericarditis was considered but ruled out. Comprehensive echocardiograms were reviewed in blinded fashion. Five principal echocardiographic variables were selected based on prior studies and potential for clinical use: (1) respiration-related ventricular septal shift, (2) variation in mitral infow E velocity, (3) medial mitral annular e' velocity, (4) ratio of medial mitral annular e' to lateral e', and (5) hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio. All 5 principal variables differed signifcantly between the groups. In patients with atrial fbrillation or futter (n=29), all but mitral infow velocity remained signifcantly different. Three variables were independently associated with constrictive pericarditis: (1) ventricular septal shift, (2) medial mitral e', and (3) hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio. The presence of ventricular septal shift in combination with either medial e'≥9 cm/s or hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio ≥0.79 corresponded to a desirable combination of sensitivity (87\\%) and specifcity (91\\%). The specifcity increased to 97\\% when all 3 factors were present, but the sensitivity decreased to 64\\%. Conclusions-Echocardiography allows differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive myocardial disease and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Respiration-related ventricular septal shift, preserved or increased medial mitral annular e' velocity, and prominent hepatic vein expiratory diastolic fow reversals are independently associated with the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.},\n  keywords = {Echocardiography,{Pericarditis, constrictive}},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/KDHJPRMN/welch-2014-constrictive-pericarditis.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173925,"version":0},"$loki":1014},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2175,"entry":"@incollection{Wey2019,\n  title = {Biventricular {{Pacing}} for {{Patients}} with {{Complete Heart Block}}},\n  booktitle = {Clinical {{Controversies}} in {{Device Therapy}} for {{Cardiac Arrhythmias}}},\n  author = {Wey, Hannah E. and Upadhyay, Gaurav A. and Tung, Roderick},\n  date = {2019},\n  pages = {57--76},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-22882-8_5}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173926,"version":0},"$loki":1015},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1876,"entry":"@article{White2019,\n  title = {Quantitative Analysis of Spectral {{Doppler}} Clicks in Assessment of Aortic Stenosis},\n  author = {White, Brent and Wessel, Sean and Zheng, Weili and Gonzalez, Daniel and Sovari, Ali and Konda, Sreenivas and Frazin, Leon},\n  date = {2019-12-01},\n  journaltitle = {Echocardiography},\n  volume = {36},\n  number = {12},\n  eprint = {31769078},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {2158--2166},\n  publisher = {{John Wiley \\& Sons, Ltd}},\n  issn = {15408175},\n  doi = {10.1111/echo.14541},\n  url = {https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.cc.uic.edu/doi/full/10.1111/echo.14541},\n  urldate = {2022-03-08},\n  abstract = {Objectives: This study was performed to evaluate an additional echocardiographic spectral Doppler marker, which would identify severe aortic stenosis (AS). Background: Echocardiography is most commonly utilized to assess AS and has been validated against invasive measurements. However, the data obtained are not always in agreement, leaving a conundrum regarding the true severity of AS and can lead to other diagnostic procedures. This highlights the importance of improved noninvasive diagnostic techniques. Methods: Forty-eight indeterminate cases of calcific AS that had been previously evaluated by both echocardiography and cardiac catheterization were included in the study, using cardiac catheterization as the gold standard for calculation of aortic valve area (AVA). The intensity of opening and closing of the aortic valve, represented by bright vertical deflections on the CW spectral waveform, was quantified using ImageJ software to generate pixel intensity histograms to create opening and closing click (OC and CC) ratios. These ratios were compared with echocardiographic variables and catheterization AVA. Results: Thirty-five patients were found to have severe AS and 13 patients were found to have nonsevere AS, as assessed by cardiac catheterization. CC ratio was found to be a significant predictor of severe AS with an OR 0.024 (95\\% CI: 0.002-0.378, P =.0079). Adding CC to a model using standard echocardiographic parameters resulted in significant improvement in the C-statistic (0.693 to 0.835, P =.0134). Conclusions: An additional Doppler marker measuring the aortic valve CC ratio has been found to improve detection of severe AS.},\n  keywords = {aortic stenosis,aortic valve closing click,aortic valve opening click,cardiac catheterization,echocardiography,pixel density histogram,spectral doppler},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7ZY33SBQ/full-text.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173932,"version":0},"$loki":1016},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2155,"entry":"@article{Whitlock2021,\n  title = {Left {{Atrial Appendage Occlusion}} during {{Cardiac Surgery}} to {{Prevent Stroke}}},\n  author = {Whitlock, Richard P. and Belley-Cote, Emilie P. and Paparella, Domenico and Healey, Jeff S. and Brady, Katheryn and Sharma, Mukul and Reents, Wilko and Budera, Petr and Baddour, Andony J. and Fila, Petr and Devereaux, P.J. and Bogachev-Prokophiev, Alexander and Boening, Andreas and Teoh, Kevin H.T. and Tagarakis, Georgios I. and Slaughter, Mark S. and Royse, Alistair G. and McGuinness, Shay and Alings, Marco and Punjabi, Prakash P. and Mazer, C.

The procedure can be performed during cardiac surgery undertaken for other reasons. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial involving participants with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of at least 2 (on a scale from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk of stroke) who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery for another indication. The participants were randomly assigned to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage during surgery; all the participants were expected to receive usual care, including oral anticoagulation, during follow-up. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging) or systemic embolism. The participants, research personnel, and primary care physicians (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments. RESULTS The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group, with a mean age of 71 years and a mean CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.2. The participants were followed for a mean of 3.8 years. A total of 92.1\\% of the participants received the assigned procedure, and at 3 years, 76.8\\% of the participants continued to receive oral anticoagulation. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8\\%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0\\%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95\\% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.85; P = 0.001). The incidence of perioperative bleeding, heart failure, or death did not differ significantly between the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS Among participants with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it.

We sought to determine the frequency of this complication in the STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons) database as well as the outcomes of patients who suffer intraoperative aortic dissection. We then developed a model to identify preoperative characteristics and intraoperative factors associated with the complication. Methods: All patients from the STS database who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve surgery, or mitral valve surgery were included. Exclusion criteria included any patient who had aortic dissection listed as a reason for urgent or emergent operation. Data collected were then analyzed to describe the frequency of aortic dissection as a complication as well as its consequences. We then analyzed a more recent era that included information on arterial cannulation site (femoral-other versus aortic) to identify risk factors for aortic dissection. Results: Of 2,219,991 patients analyzed, 1,294 suffered aortic dissection as a complication of their surgery, for an incidence of 0.06\\%. This complication frequently led to catastrophic results, with 615 of 1,294 (48\\%) operative mortality. A logistic regression model was created based on 2004 to 2007 STS data. Of 680,025 patients analyzed, 436 patients suffered an aortic dissection. The analysis yielded nine significant risk factors including femoral arterial cannulation, preoperative steroids, and Asian race; the presence of diabetes appeared to be protective.

A problem resident is defined by the American Board of Internal Medicine as \"a trainee who demonstrates a significant enough problem that requires intervention by someone of authority.\" Data are sparse regarding identification and management of such residents.ObjectiveTo gain more understanding of the prevalence, identification, management, and prevention of problem residents within US internal medicine residency programs.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsMailed survey of all 404 internal medicine residency program directors in the United States in October 1999, of whom 298 (74\\%) responded.Main Outcome MeasuresPrevalence of problem residents; type of problems encountered; factors associated with identification and management of problem residents.ResultsThe mean point prevalence of problem residents during academic year 1998-1999 was 6.9\\% (SD, 5.7\\%; range, 0\\%-39\\%), and 94\\% of programs had problem residents. The most frequently reported difficulties of problem residents were insufficient medical knowledge (48\\%), poor clinical judgment (44\\%), and inefficient use of time (44\\%). Stressors and depression were the most frequently identified underlying problems (42\\% and 24\\%, respectively). The most frequent processes by which problem residents were discovered included direct observation (82\\%) and critical incidents (59\\%). Chief residents and attending physicians most frequently identified problem residents (84\\% and 76\\%, respectively); problem residents rarely identified themselves (2\\%). Many program directors believed that residents who are from an underrepresented minority, are international medical graduates, or are older than 35 years are at increased risk of being identified as a problem resident (P\\&lt;.05). Program directors believed that frequent feedback sessions (65\\%) and an assigned mentor for structured supervision (53\\%) were the most helpful interventions.ConclusionNearly all internal medicine residency programs in this sample had problem residents, whose presenting characteristics and underlying issues were diverse and complex.},\n  keywords = {internal medicine,medical residencies},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7TKXKLLH/2000_Yao, Wright_National Survey of Internal Medicine Residency Program Directors Regarding Problem Residents.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173958,"version":0},"$loki":1021},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":48,"entry":"@article{Yao2001,\n  title = {The Challenge of Problem Residents},\n  author = {Yao, David C and Wright, Scott M},\n  date = {2001-07},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of General Internal Medicine},\n  volume = {16},\n  number = {7},\n  eprint = {11520388},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {486--492},\n  publisher = {{Springer}},\n  issn = {08848734},\n  doi = {10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016007486.x},\n  url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11520388},\n  urldate = {2018-03-12},\n  abstract = {Internal medicine residency training is demanding and residents can experience a wide variety of professional and personal difficulties.

Previous articles that have been published on the topic of problem residents primarily addressed concerns such as impairment due to depression and substance abuse. The content of this article is derived from a comprehensive review of the literature as well as other data sources such as interviews with program directors and workshops at national professional meetings. This article focuses primarily on four issues related to problem residents: their identification, underlying causes, management, and prevention. The study attempts to be evidence-based, wherever possible, highlighting what is known. Recommendations based on the synthesis of the data are also made. Future ongoing studies of problem residents will improve our understanding of the matters involved, and may ultimately lead to improved outcomes for these trainees.},\n  keywords = {Internship,Medical education,Problem resident,Residency},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7M3ZZGR6/2001_Yao, Wright_The challenge of problem residents.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173962,"version":0},"$loki":1022},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":2157,"entry":"@article{Yao2018,\n  title = {Association of Surgical Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion with Subsequent Stroke and Mortality among Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery},\n  author = {Yao, Xiaoxi and Gersh, Bernard J. and Holmes, David R. and Melduni, Rowlens M. and Johnsrud, Daniel O. and Sangaralingham, Lindsey R. and Shah, Nilay D. and Noseworthy, Peter A.},\n  date = {2018-05-22},\n  journaltitle = {JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association},\n  volume = {319},\n  number = {20},\n  eprint = {29800182},\n  eprinttype = {pmid},\n  pages = {2116--2126},\n  publisher = {{American Medical Association}},\n  issn = {15383598},\n  doi = {10.1001/jama.2018.6024},\n  abstract = {IMPORTANCE Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAAO) may be performed during concurrent cardiac surgery. However, few data exist on the association of LAAO with long-term risk of stroke, and some evidence suggests that this procedure may be associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of surgical LAAO performed during cardiac surgery with risk of stroke, mortality, and development of subsequent AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using a large US administrative database that contains data from adult patients (18 years) with private insurance or Medicare Advantage who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or valve surgery between January 1, 2009, and March 30, 2017, with final follow-up on March 31, 2017. One-to-one propensity score matching was used to balance patients on 76 dimensions to compare those with vs without LAAO, stratified by history of prior AF at the time of surgery. EXPOSURES Surgical LAAO vs no surgical LAAO during cardiac surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were stroke (ie, ischemic stroke or systemic embolism) and all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were postoperative AF (AF within 30 days after surgery among patients without prior AF) and long-term AF-related health utilization (event rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations). RESULTS Among 75 782 patients who underwent cardiac surgery (mean age, 66.0 [SD, 11.2] years; 2 2091 [29.2\\%] women, 25 721 [33.9\\%] with preexisting AF), 4374 (5.8\\%) underwent concurrent LAAO, and mean follow-up was 2.1 (SD, 1.9) years. In the 8590 propensity score–matched patients, LAAO was associated with a reduced risk of stroke (1.14 vs 1.59 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95\\% CI, 0.56-0.96]; P = .03) and mortality (3.01 vs 4.30 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.71 [95\\% CI, 0.60-0.84]; P {$<$} .001). LAAO was associated with higher rates of AF-related outpatient visits (11.96 vs 10.26 events per person-year; absolute difference, 1.70 [95\\% CI, 1.60-1.80] events per person-year; rate ratio, 1.17 [95\\% CI, 1.10-1.24]; P {$<$} .001) and hospitalizations (0.36 vs 0.32 event per person-year; absolute difference, 0.04 [95\\% CI, 0.02-0.06] event per person-year; rate ratio, 1.13 [95\\% CI, 1.05-1.21]; P = .002). In patients with prior AF (6438/8590 [74.9\\%]) with vs without LAAO, risk of stroke was 1.11 vs 1.71 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.68 [95\\% CI, 0.50-0.92]; P = .01) and risk of mortality was 3.22 vs 4.93 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.67 [95\\% CI, 0.56-0.80]; P {$<$} .001), respectively. In patients without prior AF (2152/8590 [25.1\\%]) with vs without LAAO, risk of stroke was 1.23 vs 1.26 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.95 [95\\% CI, 0.54-1.68]), risk of mortality was 2.30 vs 2.49 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.92 [95\\% CI, 0.61-1.37]), and risk of postoperative AF was 27.7\\% vs 20.2\\% events per 100 person-years (HR, 1.46 [95\\% CI, 1.22-1.73]; P {$<$} .001). The interaction term between prior AF and LAAO was not significant (P = .29 for stroke and P = .16 for mortality). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, concurrent surgical LAAO, compared with no surgical LAAO, was associated with reduced risk of subsequent stroke and all-cause mortality. Further research, including from randomized clinical trials, is needed to more definitively determine the role of surgical LAAO.},\n  file = {/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/NPHEUTJM/jama_yao_2018_oi_180050.pdf}\n}\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686708173968,"version":0},"$loki":1023},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1793,"entry":"@article{Zipes1997,\n  title = {A {{Comparison}} of {{Antiarrhythmic-Drug Therapy}} with {{Implantable Defibrillators}} in {{Patients Resuscitated}} from {{Near-Fatal Ventricular Arrhythmias}}},\n  author = {Douglas P.

They can be treated with either an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or antiarrhythmic drugs, but the relative efficacy of these two treatment strategies is unknown. Methods: To address this issue, we conducted a randomized comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients who had been resuscitated from near-fatal ventricular fibrillation or who had undergone cardioversion from sustained ventricular tachycardia. Patients with ventricular tachycardia also had either syncope or other serious cardiac symptoms, along with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.40 or less. One group of patients was treated with implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator; the other received class III antiarrhythmic drugs, primarily amiodarone at empirically determined doses. Fifty-six clinical centers screened all patients who presented with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation during a period of nearly four years. Of 1016 patients (45 percent of whom had ventricular fibrillation, and 55 percent ventricular tachycardia), 507 were randomly assigned to treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and 509 to antiarrhythmic-drug therapy. The primary end point was overall mortality. Results: Follow-up was complete for 1013 patients (99.7 percent). Overall survival was greater with the implantable defibrillator, with unadjusted estimates of 89.3 percent, as compared with 82.3 percent in the antiarrhythmic-drug group at one year, 81.6 perCent versus 74.7 percent at two years, and 75.4 percent versus 64.1 percent at three years (P{$<$}0.02). The corresponding reductions in mortality (with 95 percent confidence limits) with the implantable defibrillator were 39±20 percent, 27±21 percent, and 31±21 percent. Conclusions: Among survivors of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia causing severe symptoms, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is superior to antiarrhythmic drugs for increasing overall survival.},\n  keywords = {Aged,Amiodarone / therapeutic use*,Anti-Arrhythmia Agents / therapeutic use*,Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators,Clinical
