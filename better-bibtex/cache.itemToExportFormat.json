We focus on several approaches to dose-response in occupational cohort studies. Categorical analyses are useful for detecting the shape of dose-response. However, they depend on the number and location of cutpoints and result in step functions rather than smooth curves. Restricted cubic splines and penalized splines are useful parametric techniques that provide smooth curves. Although splines can complement categorical analyses, they do not provide interpretable parameters. The shapes of these curves will depend on the degree of \"smoothing\" chosen by the analyst. We recommend combining categorical analyses and some type of smoother, with the goal of developing a reasonably simple parametric model. A simple parametric model should serve as the goal of dose-response analyses because (1) most \"true\" exposure response curves in nature may be reasonably simple, (2) a simple parametric model is easily communicated and used by others, and (3) a simple parametric model is the best tool for risk assessors and regulators seeking to estimate individual excess risks per unit of exposure. We discuss these issues and others, including whether the best model is always the one that fits the best, reasons to prefer a linear model for risk in the low-exposure region when conducting risk assessment, and common methods of calculating excess lifetime risk at a given exposure from epidemiologic results (eg, from rate ratios). Points are illustrated using data from a study of dioxin and cancer.","date":"2004","accessDate":"2019-03-27","extra":"PMID: 14712148\nCitation Key: Steenland2004a\nISBN: 1044-3983","volume":"15","pages":"63-70","publicationTitle":"Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1097/01.ede.0000100287.45004.e7","issue":"1","ISSN":"10443983","creators":[{"firstName":"Kyle","lastName":"Steenland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James A","lastName":"Deddens","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["3FUR6G2H"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["cc619f99-fc4a-3b45-825c-3422ccf037e4"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["cc619f99-fc4a-3b45-825c-3422ccf037e4"]},"dateAdded":"2019-03-27T17:45:13Z","dateModified":"2019-11-04T17:19:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ANZM5NSR","itemID":605,"attachments":[{"key":"FV595XWA","version":293,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","url":"https://www-jstor-org.proxy.library.emory.edu/stable/pdf/20485841.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A28af76a4416a5e5cb55810507358b4a5","parentItem":"ANZM5NSR","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"m-api-35caed23-8786-fdfb-30ac-abf776c5c775.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["9b0613aeda9a9179590ebac1fe23d3d1db0438b1"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:40:03Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:40:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/FV595XWA","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/FV595XWA/m-api-35caed23-8786-fdfb-30ac-abf776c5c775.pdf","defaultPath":"files/606/m-api-35caed23-8786-fdfb-30ac-abf776c5c775.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611520,"version":0},"$loki":1},{"itemID":621,"item":{"key":"D2V23GR8","version":294,"itemType":"report","title":"A primer on regression splines","abstractNote":"1. Overview B-splines constitute an appealing method for the nonparametric estimation of a range of statis-tical objects of interest. In this primer we focus our attention on the estimation of a conditional mean, i.e. the 'regression function'. A 'spline' is a function that is constructed piece-wise from polynomial functions. The term comes from the tool used by shipbuilders and drafters to construct smooth shapes having desired properties. Drafters have long made use of a bendable strip fixed in position at a number of points that relaxes to form a smooth curve passing through those points. The malleability of the spline material combined with the constraint of the control points would cause the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy required for bending it between the fixed points, this being the smoothest possible shape. We shall rely on a class of splines called 'B-splines' ('basis-splines'). A B-spline function is the maximally differentiable interpolative basis function. The B-spline is a generalization of the Bézier curve (a B-spline with no 'interior knots' is a Bézier curve). B-splines are defined by their 'order' m and number of interior 'knots' N (there are two 'endpoints' which are themselves knots so the total number of knots will be N +2). The degree of the B-spline polynomial will be the spline order m minus one (degree = m − 1). To best appreciate the nature of B-splines, we shall first consider a simple type of spline, the Bézier function, and then move on to the more flexible and powerful generalization, the B-spline itself. We begin with the univariate case in Section 2 where we consider the univariate Bézier function. In Section 3 we turn to the univariate B-spline function, and then in Section 4 we turn to the multivariate case where we also briefly mention how one could handle the presence of categorical predictors. We presume that interest lies in 'regression spline' methodology which differs in a number of ways from 'smoothing splines', both of which are popular in applied settings. The fundamen-tal difference between the two approaches is that smoothing splines explicitly penalize roughness and use the data points themselves as potential knots whereas regression splines place knots at equidistant/equiquantile points. We direct the interested reader to Wahba (1990) for a treatment of smoothing splines. Date: December 18, 2014. These notes are culled from a variety of sources.

Bézier curves We present an overview of Bézier curves which form the basis for the B-splines that follow. We begin with a simple illustration, that of a quadratic Bézier curve. Example 2.1. A quadratic Bézier curve. A quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced by the function B(x), given points β 0 , β 1 , and β 2 , where B(x) = β 0 (1 − x) 2 + 2β 1 (1 − x)x + β 2 x 2 = 2 i=0 β i B i (x), x ∈ [0, 1]. The terms B 0 (x) = (1 − x) 2 , B 1 (x) = 2(1 − x)x, and B 2 (x) = x 2 are the 'bases' which is this case turn out to be 'Bernstein polynomials' (Bernstein (1912)). For our purposes the 'control points' β i , i = 0, 1, 2, will be parameters that could be selected by least squares fitting in a regression setting, but more on that later. Consider the following simple example where we plot a quadratic Bézier curve with arbitrary control points: 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0","date":"2018","accessDate":"2019-03-28","extra":"Publication Title: CRAN.

Cohen (1988) provided guidelines for the purposes of interpreting the magnitude of a correlation, as well as estimating power. Specifically, r = 0.10, r = 0.30, and r = 0.50 were recommended to be considered small, medium, and large in magnitude, respectively. However, Cohen's effect size guidelines were based principally upon an essentially qualitative impression, rather than a systematic, quantitative analysis of data. Consequently, the purpose of this investigation was to develop a large sample of previously published meta-analytically derived correlations which would allow for an evaluation of Cohen's guidelines from an empirical perspective. Based on 708 meta-analytically derived correlations, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlations of 0.11, 0.19, and 0.29, respectively. Based on the results, it is suggested that Cohen's correlation guidelines are too exigent, as < 3% of correlations in the literature were found to be as large as r = 0.50. Consequently, in the absence of any other information, individual differences researchers are recommended to consider correlations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 as relatively small, typical, and relatively large, in the context of a power analysis, as well as the interpretation of statistical results from a normative perspective.","date":"2016-11-01","accessDate":"2019-11-23","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier Ltd\nCitation Key: Gignac2016a","volume":"102","pages":"74-78","publicationTitle":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.069","ISSN":"01918869","creators":[{"firstName":"Gilles E.","lastName":"Gignac","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eva T.","lastName":"Szodorai","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Correlations","type":1},{"tag":"Effect size","type":1},{"tag":"Guidelines","type":1}],"collections":["3FUR6G2H"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["58b85a5e-5dc7-352e-8526-1d21482e2dc4"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["58b85a5e-5dc7-352e-8526-1d21482e2dc4"]},"dateAdded":"2019-11-24T04:04:54Z","dateModified":"2023-04-11T22:26:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/Q2WEI35Z","itemID":1127,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611526,"version":0},"$loki":3},{"itemID":1148,"item":{"key":"BVS56YU3","version":347,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A systematic comparison of recurrent event models for application to composite endpoints","abstractNote":"Background Many clinical trials focus on the comparison of the treatment effect between two or more groups concerning a rarely occurring event. In this situation, showing a relevant effect with an acceptable power requires the observation of a large number of patients over a long period of time. For feasibility issues, it is therefore often considered to include several event types of interest, non-fatal or fatal, and to combine them within a composite endpoint. Commonly, a composite endpoint is analyzed with standard survival analysis techniques by assessing the time to the first occurring event. This approach neglects that an individual may experience more than one event which leads to a loss of information. As an alternative, composite endpoints could be analyzed by models for recurrent events. There exists a number of such models, e.g. regression models based on count data or Cox-based models such as the approaches of Andersen and Gill, Prentice, Williams and Peterson or, Wei, Lin and Weissfeld. Although some of the methods were already compared within the literature there exists no systematic investigation for the special requirements regarding composite endpoints. Methods Within this work a simulation-based comparison of recurrent event models applied to composite endpoints is provided for different realistic clinical trial scenarios. Results We demonstrate that the Andersen-Gill model and the Prentice- Williams-Petersen models show similar results under various data scenarios whereas the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld model delivers effect estimators which can considerably deviate under commonly met data scenarios. Conclusion Based on the conducted simulation study, this paper helps to understand the pros and cons of the investigated methods in the context of composite endpoints and provides therefore recommendations for an adequate statistical analysis strategy and a meaningful interpretation of results.","date":"2018","accessDate":"2019-12-21","extra":"Citation Key: Ozga2018a","volume":"18","publicationTitle":"BMC Medical Research Methodology","DOI":"10.1186/s12874-017-0462-x","issue":"1","ISSN":"14712288","creators":[{"firstName":"Ann Kathrin","lastName":"Ozga","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Meinhard","lastName":"Kieser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Geraldine","lastName":"Rauch","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Composite endpoints","type":1},{"tag":"Recurrent event analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Simulation study","type":1}],"collections":["3FUR6G2H"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["131192b0-75cf-340e-a0c4-940cea6ccbe9"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["131192b0-75cf-340e-a0c4-940cea6ccbe9"]},"dateAdded":"2019-12-21T16:12:21Z","dateModified":"2023-04-11T22:26:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/BVS56YU3","itemID":1148,"attachments":[{"key":"LNJFIC9N","version":347,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"BVS56YU3","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["8c332b40c9bef910a062324e73e84edd532aa101"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:43:36Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:43:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/LNJFIC9N","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/LNJFIC9N/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1149/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611528,"version":0},"$loki":4},{"itemID":1150,"item":{"key":"5DMXNIGG","version":347,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Modelling recurrent events: A tutorial for analysis in epidemiology","abstractNote":"In many biomedical studies, the event of interest can occur more than once in a participant.

Comprehensive and standardised surveillance for non-communicable diseases was recommended at the United Nations High-level meeting in 2011. Aims: To develop a model surveillance system for CMDs and risk factors that could be adopted for continued assessment of burdens from multiple perspectives in South-Asian countries. Methods. Design: Hybrid model with two cross-sectional serial surveys three years apart to monitor trend, with a three-year prospective follow-up of the first cohort. Sites: Three urban settings (Chennai and New Delhi in India; Karachi in Pakistan), 4000 participants in each site stratified by gender and age. Sampling methodology: Multi-stage cluster random sampling; followed by within-household participant selection through a combination of Health Information National Trends Study (HINTS) and Kish methods. Culturally-appropriate and methodologically-relevant data collection instruments were developed to gather information on CMDs and their risk factors; quality of life, health-care utilisation and costs, along with objective measures of anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters. The cohort follow-up is designed as a pilot study to understand the feasibility of estimating incidence of risk factors, disease events, morbidity, and mortality. Results: The overall participant response rate in the first cross-sectional survey was 94.1% (Chennai 92.4%, n=4943; Delhi 95.7%, n=4425; Karachi 94.3%, n=4016). 51.8% of the participants were females, 61.6%<45years, 27.5% 45-60years and 10.9% >60years. Discussion. This surveillance model will generate data on prevalence and trends; help study the complex life-course patterns of CMDs, and provide a platform for developing and testing interventions and tools for prevention and control of CMDs in South-Asia. It will also help understanding the challenges and opportunities in establishing a surveillance system across countries. © 2012 Nair et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","date":"2012","url":"BMC Public Health","extra":"Publisher: BMC Public Health\nCitation Key: Nair2012","volume":"12","pages":"1","publicationTitle":"BMC Public Health","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2458-12-701","issue":"1","ISSN":"14712458","creators":[{"firstName":"Manisha","lastName":"Nair","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammed K.","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vamadevan S.","lastName":"Ajay","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roopa","lastName":"Shivashankar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viswanathan","lastName":"Mohan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rajendra","lastName":"Pradeepa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohan","lastName":"Deepa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hassan M.","lastName":"Khan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad M.","lastName":"Kadir","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zafar A.","lastName":"Fatmi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"K.

A competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. In a study examining time to death attributable to cardiovascular causes, death attributable to noncardiovascular causes is a competing risk. When estimating the crude incidence of outcomes, analysts should use the cumulative incidence function, rather than the complement of the Kaplan-Meier survival function. The use of the Kaplan-Meier survival function results in estimates of incidence that are biased upward, regardless of whether the competing events are independent of one another. When fitting regression models in the presence of competing risks, researchers can choose from 2 different families of models: modeling the effect of covariates on the cause-specific hazard of the outcome or modeling the effect of covariates on the cumulative incidence function. The former allows one to estimate the effect of the covariates on the rate of occurrence of the outcome in those subjects who are currently event free. The latter allows one to estimate the effect of covariates on the absolute risk of the outcome over time.

The recent upsurge of interest in life-course epidemiology and the study of developmental influences on later health has provided a new impetus to study twins as a source of unique insights. Twins are of special interest because they provide naturally matched pairs where the confounding effects of a large number of potentially causal factors (such as maternal nutrition or gestation length) may be removed by comparisons between twins who share them. The traditional tool of epidemiological ‘risk factor analysis’ is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model.","date":"2005-10-01","url":"http://academic.oup.com/ije/article/34/5/1089/645923/Regression-models-for-twin-studies-a-critical","accessDate":"2021-03-11","extra":"PMID: 16087687\nPublisher: Oxford University Press on\nCitation Key: Carlin2005\nISBN: 0300-5771 (Print)\\r0300-5771","volume":"34","pages":"1089-1099","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyi153","issue":"5","ISSN":"03005771","creators":[{"firstName":"John B","lastName":"Carlin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lyle C","lastName":"Gurrin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan AC C","lastName":"Sterne","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ruth","lastName":"Morley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Terry","lastName":"Dwyer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Statistics","type":1},{"tag":"Data correlation","type":1},{"tag":"Regression models","type":1},{"tag":"Twin studies","type":1}],"collections":["3FUR6G2H"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["7524f02f-0f1b-4921-a03c-8bfce764f230"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["22b98191-3279-3f9d-a7a4-e9a3ed4d636e"]},"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T11:49:23Z","dateModified":"2023-04-11T22:26:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/TBVKT3CV","itemID":1919,"attachments":[{"key":"4DKXIVU8","version":505,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"TBVKT3CV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2005_Carlin et al._Regression models for twin studies A critical review.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["ccee410745e3240403cd7026dd990562cd3bce4b"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:49:21Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:49:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/4DKXIVU8","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/4DKXIVU8/2005_Carlin et al._Regression models for twin studies A critical review.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1920/2005_Carlin et al._Regression models for twin studies A critical review.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611537,"version":0},"$loki":8},{"itemID":2005,"item":{"key":"EW9L623L","version":432,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Information criteria for Firth's penalized partial likelihood approach in Cox regression models","abstractNote":"In the estimation of Cox regression models, maximum partial likelihood estimates might be infinite in a monotone likelihood setting, where partial likelihood converges to a finite value and parameter estimates converge to infinite values. To address monotone likelihood, previous studies have applied Firth's bias correction method to Cox regression models. However, while the model selection criteria for Firth's penalized partial likelihood approach have not yet been studied, a heuristic AIC-type information criterion can be used in a statistical package. Application of the heuristic information criterion to data obtained from a prospective observational study of patients with multiple brain metastases indicated that the heuristic information criterion selects models with many parameters and ignores the adequacy of the model. Moreover, we showed that the heuristic information criterion tends to select models with many regression parameters as the sample size increases. Thereby, in the present study, we propose an alternative AIC-type information criterion based on the risk function. A Bayesian information criterion type was also evaluated. Further, the presented simulation results confirm that the proposed criteria performed well in a monotone likelihood setting. The proposed AIC-type criterion was applied to prospective observational study data.

Branch DAGs comprise a list of assumptions which must be justified as negligible. We define two types of branch DAGs: exclusion branch DAGs add a single- or bidirectional pathway between two nodes in the root DAG (e.g., direct pathways and colliders), while misdirection branch DAGs represent alternative pathways that could be drawn between objects (e.g., creating a collider by reversing the direction of causation for a controlled confounder).

The solution we suggest is an adaptation of a procedure by Firth (1993, Biometrika 80, 27-38) originally developed to reduce the bias of maximum likelihood estimates. This procedure produces finite parameter estimates by means of penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Corresponding Wald-type tests and confidence intervals are available, but it is shown that penalized likelihood ratio tests and profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals are often preferable. An empirical study of the suggested procedures confirms satisfactory performance of both estimation and inference. The advantage of the procedure over previous options of analysis is finally exemplified in the analysis of a breast cancer study.","date":"2001","extra":"PMID: 11252585\nCitation Key: Heinze2001","volume":"57","pages":"114-119","publicationTitle":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00114.x","issue":"1","ISSN":"0006341X","creators":[{"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Heinze","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schemper","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Survival analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Bias reduction","type":1},{"tag":"Infinite estimates","type":1},{"tag":"Modified score","type":1},{"tag":"Penalized likelihood","type":1},{"tag":"Profile likelihood","type":1},{"tag":"Proportional hazards model","type":1},{"tag":"Separation","type":1}],"collections":["3FUR6G2H"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["98eccd88-f537-381c-8b61-11bbfe15bb2b"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["98eccd88-f537-381c-8b61-11bbfe15bb2b"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-17T18:01:44Z","dateModified":"2023-04-11T22:26:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/QBZVX9QD","itemID":2050,"attachments":[{"key":"9IPQQ2UJ","version":437,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"QBZVX9QD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Biometrics - 2004 - Heinze - A Solution to the Problem of Monotone Likelihood in Cox Regression.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["e399c586cff0207fb605d86dde80bccdf8cedf46"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:50:48Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:50:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9IPQQ2UJ","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/9IPQQ2UJ/Biometrics - 2004 - Heinze - A Solution to the Problem of Monotone Likelihood in Cox Regression.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2051/Biometrics - 2004 - Heinze - A Solution to the Problem of Monotone Likelihood in Cox Regression.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611547,"version":0},"$loki":13},{"itemID":2180,"item":{"key":"Y8LUNFRL","version":450,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Extensions of net reclassification improvement calculations to measure usefulness of new biomarkers","abstractNote":"Appropriate quantification of added usefulness offered by new markers included in risk prediction algorithms is a problem of active research and debate. Standard methods, including statistical significance and c statistic are useful but not sufficient. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) offers a simple intuitive way of quantifying improvement offered by new markers and has been gaining popularity among researchers. However, several aspects of the NRI have not been studied in sufficient detail.In this paper we propose a prospective formulation for the NRI which offers immediate application to survival and competing risk data as well as allows for easy weighting with observed or perceived costs. We address the issue of the number and choice of categories and their impact on NRI. We contrast category-based NRI with one which is category-free and conclude that NRIs cannot be compared across studies unless they are defined in the same manner. We discuss the impact of differing event rates when models are applied to different samples or definitions of events and durations of follow-up vary between studies. We also show how NRI can be applied to case-control data. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated in a Framingham Heart Study example.In conclusion, NRI can be readily calculated for survival, competing risk, and case-control data, is more objective and comparable across studies using the category-free version, and can include relative costs for classifications. We recommend that researchers clearly define and justify the choices they make when choosing NRI for their application.

Often, potentially important new predictors are available in addition to the conventional markers. The question is how to quantify the improvement from the new markers for prediction of the patient's risk in order to aid cost-benefit decisions. The standard method, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, to measure the added value may not be sensitive enough to capture incremental improvements from the new markers. Recently, some novel alternatives to area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, such as integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement, were proposed. In this paper, we consider a class of measures for evaluating the incremental values of new markers, which includes the preceding two as special cases. We present a unified procedure for making inferences about measures in the class with censored event time data. The large sample properties of our procedures are theoretically justified. We illustrate the new proposal with data from a cancer study to evaluate a new gene score for prediction of the patient's survival. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","date":"2013-06-30","extra":"PMID: 23037800\nCitation Key: Uno2013","volume":"32","pages":"2430-2442","publicationTitle":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.5647","issue":"14","ISSN":"02776715","creators":[{"firstName":"Hajime","lastName":"Uno","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Tian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianxi","lastName":"Cai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Isaac S.","lastName":"Kohane","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"L.

Background: Although mutations in ion channels, gap junction proteins, and signaling molecules have been described for Mendelian forms of AF, penetrance is highly variable. Recent studies have consistently identified 2 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region as independent AF susceptibility alleles. Methods: Eleven families in which AF was present in <2 members who also shared a candidate gene mutation were studied. These mutations were identified in all subjects with familial lone AF (n = 33) as well as apparently unaffected family members (age >50 years with no AF; n = 17). Results: Mutations were identified in SCN5A (n = 6), NPPA (n = 2), KCNQ1 (n = 1), KCNA5 (n = 1), and NKX2.5 (n = 1). In genetic association analyses, unstratified and stratified according to age of onset of AF and unaffected age >50 years, there was a highly statistically significant association between the presence of both common (rs2200733 and rs10033464) and rare variants and AF (unstratified p = 1 × 10-8, stratified [age of onset <50 years and unaffected age >50 years] p = 7.6 × 10-5) (unstratified p < 0.0001, stratified [age of onset <50 years and unaffected age >50 years] p < 0.0001). Genetic association analyses showed that the presence of common 4q25 risk alleles predicted whether carriers of rare mutations developed AF (p = 2.2 × 10-4). Conclusions: Common AF-associated 4q25 polymorphisms modify the clinical expression of latent cardiac ion channel and signaling molecule gene mutations associated with familial AF. These findings support the idea that the genetic architecture of AF is complex and includes both rare and common genetic variants. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","date":"2012-09-25","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22818067/","accessDate":"2022-05-09","extra":"PMID: 22818067\nPublisher: J Am Coll Cardiol\nCitation Key: Ritchie2012","volume":"60","pages":"1173-1181","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2012.04.030","issue":"13","ISSN":"07351097","creators":[{"firstName":"Marylyn D.","lastName":"Ritchie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shane","lastName":"Rowan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gayle","lastName":"Kucera","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tanya","lastName":"Stubblefield","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marcia","lastName":"Blair","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shannon","lastName":"Carter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan M.","lastName":"Roden","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dawood","lastName":"Darbar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"genetics","type":1},{"tag":"mutations","type":1},{"tag":"polymorphisms","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["20793cd6-813a-391d-a395-e15eb9ee9d71"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["20793cd6-813a-391d-a395-e15eb9ee9d71"]},"dateAdded":"2022-05-09T13:51:36Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T19:07:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/LN8SQUSK","itemID":1888,"attachments":[{"key":"A3CAF4CU","version":421,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"LN8SQUSK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["c26f1c05a91da20df956088d71daac84c2dea56f"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:48:55Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:48:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/A3CAF4CU","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/A3CAF4CU/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1889/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611556,"version":0},"$loki":20},{"itemID":1890,"item":{"key":"47DYHSX8","version":421,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Symptomatic response to antiarrhythmic drug therapy is modulated by a common single nucleotide polymorphism in atrial fibrillation","abstractNote":"Objectives: This study tested the hypothesis that response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is modulated by 3 common loci associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 3 loci, on chromosomes 4q25 (near PITX2), 16q22 (in ZFHX3), and 1q21 (in KCNN3), that associate with either typical or lone AF. These findings indicate that variable mechanisms contribute to AF susceptibility, and suggest that response to therapy may be genotype dependent. Methods: We studied 478 and 198 Caucasian patients in the discovery cohort and validation cohort, respectively, who were prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry. Response was defined prospectively as successful rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months with <75% reduction in symptomatic AF burden. We also evaluated AF recurrence by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Symptomatic patients were also given a 24- to 48-h Holter monitor or 30-day event recorder when AF recurrence was not captured by 12-lead ECG. Results: In the discovery cohort, 399 (83%) patients were successfully rhythm controlled. Multiple clinical variables (including age, hypertension, lone AF) failed to significantly predict response to AADs; however, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10033464 at 4q25 was an independent predictor of successful rhythm control in patients with typical AF carrying the ancestral allele (wild type) versus carriers of variant allele (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83 to 12, p = 0.0013. In the validation cohort, 143 (72%) patients met the criteria for successful rhythm control, and rs10033464 was again an independent predictor of successful rhythm control, OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.06, p = 0.04. This SNP (rs10033464) was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in the discovery (39% AF recurrence) and validation (38% AF recurrence) cohorts; OR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.7 to 6, p < 0.001 and OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.98 to 9.4, p < 0.001, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that a common SNP on chromosome 4q25 associated with AF modulates response to AAD therapy and points to a potential role for stratification of therapeutic approaches by genotype. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","date":"2012-08-07","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726630/","accessDate":"2022-05-09","extra":"PMID: 22726630\nPublisher: J Am Coll Cardiol\nCitation Key: Parvez2012a","volume":"60","pages":"539-545","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2012.01.070","issue":"6","ISSN":"07351097","creators":[{"firstName":"Babar","lastName":"Parvez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Vaglio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shane","lastName":"Rowan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Raafia","lastName":"Muhammad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gayle","lastName":"Kucera","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tanya","lastName":"Stubblefield","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shannon","lastName":"Carter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Roden","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dawood","lastName":"Darbar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"polymorphisms","type":1},{"tag":"antiarrhythmics","type":1},{"tag":"genomics","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["2610724b-8668-3b5f-ab7c-b7a11330e7ce"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["2610724b-8668-3b5f-ab7c-b7a11330e7ce"]},"dateAdded":"2022-05-09T13:52:01Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T11:49:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/47DYHSX8","itemID":1890,"attachments":[{"key":"U24Q2JKC","version":421,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"47DYHSX8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["7ea76d997bb811746f51ea3b7ac73e0b9294eac4"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:48:57Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:48:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/U24Q2JKC","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/U24Q2JKC/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1891/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611557,"version":0},"$loki":21},{"itemID":1892,"item":{"key":"HPTI5N5E","version":421,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Early-Onset Atrial Fibrillation and the Prevalence of Rare Variants in Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmia Genes","abstractNote":"Importance: Early-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) can be the initial manifestation of a more serious underlying inherited cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia syndrome. Objective: To examine the results of genetic testing for early-onset AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled participants from an academic medical center who had AF diagnosed before 66 years of age and underwent whole genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. Participants were enrolled from November 23, 1999, to June 2, 2015. Data analysis was performed from October 24, 2020, to March 11, 2021. Exposures: Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included on cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sequencing data were analyzed using an automated process followed by manual review by a panel of independent, blinded reviewers. The primary outcome was classification of rare variants using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria: benign, likely benign, variant of undetermined significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. Disease-associated variants were defined as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes associated with autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant disorders. Results: Among 1293 participants (934 [72.2%] male; median [interquartile range] age at enrollment, 56 [48-61] years; median [interquartile range] age at AF diagnosis, 50 [41-56] years), genetic testing identified 131 participants (10.1%) with a disease-associated variant, 812 (62.8%) with a variant of undetermined significance, 92 (7.1%) as heterozygous carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder, and 258 (20.0%) with no suspicious variant. The likelihood of a disease-associated variant was highest in participants with AF diagnosed before the age of 30 years (20 of 119 [16.8%; 95% CI, 10.0%-23.6%]) and lowest after the age of 60 years (8 of 112 [7.1%; 95% CI, 2.4%-11.9%]). Disease-associated variants were more often associated with inherited cardiomyopathy syndromes compared with inherited arrhythmias. The most common genes were TTN (n = 38), MYH7 (n = 18), MYH6 (n = 10), LMNA (n = 9), and KCNQ1 (n = 8). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, genetic testing identified a disease-associated variant in 10% of patients with early-onset AF (the percentage was higher if diagnosed before the age of 30 years and lower if diagnosed after the age of 60 years). Most pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants are in genes associated with cardiomyopathy. These results support the use of genetic testing in early-onset AF..","date":"2021-12-01","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34495297/","accessDate":"2022-05-09","extra":"PMID: 34495297\nPublisher: JAMA Cardiol\nCitation Key: Yoneda2021","volume":"6","pages":"1371-1379","publicationTitle":"JAMA Cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2021.3370","issue":"12","ISSN":"23806591","creators":[{"firstName":"Zachary T.","lastName":"Yoneda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katherine C.","lastName":"Anderson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joseph A.","lastName":"Quintana","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew J.","lastName":"O'Neill","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard A.","lastName":"Sims","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew M.","lastName":"Glazer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christian M.","lastName":"Shaffer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Diane M.","lastName":"Crawford","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Stricker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Ye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Quinn","lastName":"Wells","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lynne W.","lastName":"Stevenson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gregory F.","lastName":"Michaud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dawood","lastName":"Darbar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Steven A.","lastName":"Lubitz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick T.","lastName":"Ellinor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan M.","lastName":"Roden","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.

The clinical significance of these rare variants in patients with early-onset AF is unknown. Objective To assess the association between rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes detected in patients with early-onset AF and time to death. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study included participants with AF diagnosed before 66 years of age who underwent whole-genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. Participants were enrolled from November 23, 1999, to June 2, 2015. Data were analyzed from February 26 to September 19, 2021. Exposures Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was time to death and was adjudicated from medical records and the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association of disease-associated variants with risk of death after adjustment for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term of age at AF diagnosis and disease-associated variant status. Results Among 1293 participants (934 [72%] male; median age at enrollment, 56.0 years; IQR, 48.0-61.0 years), disease-associated (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) rare variants were found in 131 (10%). During a median follow-up of 9.9 years (IQR, 6.9-13.2 years), 219 participants (17%) died. In univariable analysis, disease-associated variants were associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1;P = .05); the association remained significant in multivariable modeling when adjusted for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term between disease-associated variant status and age at AF diagnosis. The interaction demonstrated that disease-associated variants were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with no disease-associated variant when AF was diagnosed at a younger age (P = .008 for interaction). Higher body mass index (per IQR: HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6;P < .001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (per IQR: HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8;P < .001) were associated with higher mortality risk. There were 73 cardiomyopathy-related deaths, 40 sudden deaths, and 10 stroke-related deaths. Mortality among patients with the most prevalent genes with disease-associated variants was 26% (10 of 38 patients) forTTN, 33% (6 of 18) forMYH7, 22% (2 of 9) forLMNA, 0% (0 of 10) forMYH6, and 0% (0 of 8) forKCNQ1. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes may be associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with early-onset AF, especially those diagnosed at a younger age. Genetic testing may provide important prognostic information for patients with early-onset AF.","date":"2022-05-11","url":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2792049","accessDate":"2022-05-23","extra":"Citation Key: Yoneda2022","publicationTitle":"JAMA Cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/JAMACARDIO.2022.0810","ISSN":"2380-6583","creators":[{"firstName":"Zachary T.","lastName":"Yoneda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katherine C.","lastName":"Anderson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Ye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joseph A.","lastName":"Quintana","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew J.","lastName":"O’Neill","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard A.","lastName":"Sims","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew M.","lastName":"Glazer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Davogustto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Majd","lastName":"El-Harasis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James L.","lastName":"Laws","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brittany N.","lastName":"Saldivar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Diane M.","lastName":"Crawford","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Stricker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Quinn","lastName":"Wells","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dawood","lastName":"Darbar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gregory F.","lastName":"Michaud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lynne W.","lastName":"Stevenson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Steven A.","lastName":"Lubitz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick T.","lastName":"Ellinor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan M.","lastName":"Roden","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.

Prevention needs to start at an early age with primordial interventions at the population level. The public health dimension of AF motivates research in modifiable AF risk factors and improved precision in AF prediction and management. In this review, we summarize current knowledge in an attempt to untangle these multifaceted associations from an epidemiological perspective. We discuss disease trends, preventive opportunities offered by underlying risk factors and concomitant disorders, current developments in diagnosis and risk prediction, and prognostic implications of AF and its complications. Finally, we review current technological (eg, eHealth) and methodological (artificial intelligence) advances and their relevance for future prevention and disease management.","date":"2020-06-19","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716709","extra":"PMID: 32716709\nPublisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins\nCitation Key: Kornej2020","volume":"127","pages":"4-20","publicationTitle":"Circulation research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316340","issue":"1","ISSN":"1524-4571","creators":[{"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Kornej","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christin S","lastName":"Börschel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Renate B","lastName":"Schnabel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"risk factors","type":1},{"tag":"artificial intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"incidence","type":1},{"tag":"prevalence","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["53e4f4bf-187f-3689-93dc-23df7165e01f"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["53e4f4bf-187f-3689-93dc-23df7165e01f"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-20T23:18:09Z","dateModified":"2023-03-02T22:02:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/IHJ8YR3W","itemID":2054,"attachments":[{"key":"LX3L9TB2","version":437,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC7577553","parentItem":"IHJ8YR3W","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-20T23:18:09Z","dateModified":"2023-03-02T22:02:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/LX3L9TB2"},{"key":"63LBH658","version":551,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"IHJ8YR3W","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"nihms-1590304.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["295cd09d07b135136bcea1d8fc9c646d7d3b9d2f"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:50:51Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:50:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/63LBH658","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/63LBH658/nihms-1590304.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2056/nihms-1590304.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611561,"version":0},"$loki":24},{"itemID":2065,"item":{"key":"G8URUNKI","version":438,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Atrial flutter: more than just one of a kind","abstractNote":"Since its first description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial flutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved.

We reviewed the incidence, prevalence, and predictors of HF in AFL and vice versa, and the outcomes of treatment of AFL in HF. A systematic literature review of PubMed/Medline and EMBASE yielded 65 studies for inclusion and qualitative synthesis. No study described the incidence or prevalence of AFL in unselected patients with HF. Most cohorts enrolled patients with AF/AFL as interchangeable diagnoses, or highly selected patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of HF in AFL ranged from 6% to 56%. However, the phenotype of HF was never defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). No studies reported the predictors, phenotype, and prognostic implications of AFL in HF. There was significant variation in treatments studied, including the proportion that underwent ablation. When systolic dysfunction was tachycardia-mediated, catheter ablation demonstrated LVEF normalization in up to 88%, as well as reduced cardiovascular mortality. In summary, AFL and HF often coexist but are understudied, with no randomized trial data to inform care. Further research is warranted to define the epidemiology and establish optimal management.","date":"2021-12-10","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ehf2.13526","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"Citation Key:

The mean ASDR per 100,000 population for men was 5.8 (+/-0.3) and for women was 4.4 (+/-0.4). There were progressive increases in ASIR and ASDR in all but 1 state. The states with the greatest percentage change in incidence were New Hampshire (+13.5%) and Idaho (+16.0%) for men and women, respectively. The greatest change regarding mortality was seen in Mississippi (+26.3%) for men and Oregon (+53.8%) for women. In conclusion these findings provide updated evidence of increasing AF and/or AFL incidence and mortality on a national and regional level in the US, with women experiencing greater increases in incidence and mortality rates. This study demonstrates that the public health burden related to AF in the United States is progressively worsening but disproportionately across states and among women.","date":"2021","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.02.014","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"PMID: 33640365\nCitation Key: DeLago2021a","volume":"148","pages":"78-83","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.02.014","ISSN":"18791913","creators":[{"firstName":"Augustin J","lastName":"DeLago","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Essa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Ghajar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Hammond-Haley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arshi","lastName":"Parvez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Isaiah","lastName":"Nawaz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Shalhoub","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dominic C","lastName":"Marshall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Nazarian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hugh","lastName":"Calkins","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Justin D","lastName":"Salciccioli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Binu","lastName":"Philips","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["7aa2bb8a-ea97-31e2-b594-b05e8f301ea9"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["7aa2bb8a-ea97-31e2-b594-b05e8f301ea9"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T17:35:03Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T19:00:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/S9S2IB2A","itemID":2073,"attachments":[{"key":"JLVZ4K98","version":439,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"S9S2IB2A","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["174164aad09dbeaf8b32e2485b3c3d81750fd063"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:01Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/JLVZ4K98","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/JLVZ4K98/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2074/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611569,"version":0},"$loki":29},{"itemID":2075,"item":{"key":"DHYH3JKR","version":439,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Pathophysiological background and prognosis of common atrial flutter in non-elderly patients: Comparison to Atrial Fibrillation","abstractNote":"Background: It is unclear whether there is any difference in the background and prognosis between non-elderly patients who undergo catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) and common atrial flutter (CAFL). Purpose: To investigate the difference between the patient background of both CAFL and AF in the non-elderly. Methods: In 526 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of clinical paroxysmal/persistent CAFL or AF in our hospital, we enrolled only patients under 60 years old. Cases harboring both AFL and AF were excluded. We analyzed the patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during sinus rhythm, and clinical course after ablation. Results: In total, 196 patients (Cohort 1: 142 males, 156 AF cases) were analyzed. AFL patients were younger than AF patients (47.4 ± 10.6 vs. 50.2 ± 6.4years, p = 0.031) and organic heart disease (OHD) was significantly more common in AFL patients than AF patients (42.5% vs. 11.5%, p<0.001). In 161 patients excluding OHD (Cohort 2), ECG abnormalities were more frequent in AFL than in AF patients (78.3% vs. 39.1%, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in all-cause death, onset of heart failure, and cerebral strokes. On the other hand, the number of cases that required a pacemaker was significantly higher in the CAFL group than AF group (0.0% vs. 26.1%, p-value <0.001). These results suggested that CAFL may reflect occurrence of any atrial myocardial damage, even if it does not lead to heart failure. Conclusions: Our present study suggested that CAFL may be associated with a broader atrial myocardial disorder in non-elderly patients.","date":"2021","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2021.05.008","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"PMID: 34140202\nCitation Key: Takahira2021","volume":"78","pages":"362-367","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jjcc.2021.05.008","issue":"5","ISSN":"18764738","creators":[{"firstName":"Haruhiro","lastName":"Takahira","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Takatsugu","lastName":"Kajiyama","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Kondo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Nakano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miyo","lastName":"Nakano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Ito","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Kitagawa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Sugawara","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Toshinori","lastName":"Chiba","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Kobayashi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Prognosis","type":1},{"tag":"Pacemaker","type":1},{"tag":"Atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"Common atrial flutter","type":1},{"tag":"Non-elderly","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["ded55e30-608b-3b77-9778-9ee879dae187"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["ded55e30-608b-3b77-9778-9ee879dae187"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T17:35:44Z","dateModified":"2022-11-23T16:37:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/DHYH3JKR","itemID":2075,"attachments":[{"key":"9ATSYDSM","version":439,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"DHYH3JKR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["3accdcd4ca1d6a596073849e1e050f6d1b15dec7"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:03Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9ATSYDSM","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/9ATSYDSM/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2076/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611570,"version":0},"$loki":30},{"itemID":2077,"item":{"key":"VZU4V2GL","version":439,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Relation of Obesity to New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter in Adults","abstractNote":"Prospective cohort studies involving older adults report an association of obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. To assess this relation, we performed a longitudinal cohort study from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2013, using a national claims database that tracks all inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims data. The primary end point of new-onset atrial fibrillation was compared between obese and nonobese cohorts. We used logistic regression to determine the strength of association between obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes. Overall, 67,278 subjects were included in the cohort, divided evenly between those with and without a diagnosis of obesity. Obese subjects were significantly more likely to have hypertension (29.5% vs 14.6%) and diabetes (12.7% vs 5.2%) at study onset. Over 8 years of follow-up, we recorded a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in 1,511 (2.2%) subjects. Obesity was strongly associated with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation after controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.6). In conclusion, this information contributes to the growing evidence supporting the causal relation between obesity and atrial fibrillation, and emphasizes the need of addressing obesity as part of our therapeutic strategy to prevent atrial fibrillation.","date":"2018","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"PMID: 29501206\nCitation Key: Foy2018","volume":"121","pages":"1072-1075","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019","issue":"9","ISSN":"18791913","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrew J","lastName":"Foy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Mandrola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gerald V","lastName":"Naccarelli","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["e556e786-38c6-3855-82e1-05626db3852f"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["e556e786-38c6-3855-82e1-05626db3852f"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T17:35:51Z","dateModified":"2022-11-23T16:37:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/VZU4V2GL","itemID":2077,"attachments":[{"key":"YMNQG3N3","version":440,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"VZU4V2GL","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["7059fecb08fac6022a1ce0aada886b0f7335ebe4"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:04Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/YMNQG3N3","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/YMNQG3N3/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2078/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611571,"version":0},"$loki":31},{"itemID":2079,"item":{"key":"MD52FNMZ","version":440,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Comparative Risks of Ischemic Stroke in Atrial Flutter versus Atrial Fibrillation","abstractNote":"Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the risk of ischemic stroke in patients who have atrial fibrillation and patients who have atrial flutter. Methods: Using inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data from 2008 to 2014 for a 5% sample of all beneficiaries 66 years of age or older, we identified patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and those diagnosed with atrial flutter. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke. In the primary analysis, patients with atrial flutter were censored upon converting to fibrillation; in a secondary analysis, they were not. Survival statistics were used to compare incidence of stroke in patients with flutter and patients with fibrillation.

Results: We identified 14,953 patients with flutter and 318,138 with fibrillation. During a mean follow-up period of 2.8 (±2.3) years, we identified 18,900 ischemic strokes. The annual incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with flutter was 1.38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22%-1.57%) compared with 2.02% (95% CI 1.99%-2.05%) in patients with fibrillation.

Current national data trends for the incidence, stroke risk profiles, and mortality of hospitalization for NVAF and atrial flutter (AFL) are sparse. Methods: The Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was used to identify patients ≥ 20 years with incident NVAF/AFL (NVAF, ICD-9 code 427.3 or ICD-10 I48) in any diagnosis field from 2006 to 2015 in Canada, except Québec. National and provincial trends in rate over time (rate ratio, 95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for age-sex standardized hospitalizations. Trends in stroke risk profiles and in-hospital mortality rates adjusted for stroke risk factors were also calculated. Results: A total of 578,947 patients were hospitalized with incident NVAF/AFL. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range: 68-84), 82% were ≥ 65 years, 54% were men, 54% had a CHADS2 ≥ 2, and 69% had a CHA2DS2-Vasc ≥ 3. The overall age- and sex-standardized rate of NVAF/AFL hospitalization was 315 per 100,000 population and declined by 2% per year (P < 0.001). There was an annual rate decline in NVAF/AFL hospitalizations in every province. The majority of hospitalized patients are at high risk of stroke, and this risk remained unchanged.

The development of both is favored by the presence of common triggers and substrate, particularly in the setting of structural heart disease with its attendant electrical and structural remodel-ing. Conditions associated with atrial remodeling, including heart failure, hypertension, increasing age and valvular heart disease, predispose to both fibrillation and flutter. The nature of the \"peri-tricuspid\" macroreentry circuit, constrained by structural and functional barriers to electrical propagation, is now well understood. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that CTI-dependent AFL is most frequently preceded by a period of short cycle length atrial activation, and in particular by a period of AF. 1-4 Such activity induces regions of functional conduction block and slowed conduction that are necessary for the transition from multiple unstable wavefronts to a single organized circuit. 5,6 The development of functional conduction block along the crista terminalis seems particularly important in the patho-genesis of CTI-dependent AFL. 7-9 Thus the same pulmonary vein (PV) and non-PV triggers that initiate AF are also responsible , via transitional AF, for onset of the great majority of AFL episodes. This background is of prime importance when considering the accumulated literature evaluating the incidence of AF late after AFL ablation. This incidence is clearly time-dependent with reported rates of 17-22% at 6 months, increasing to 50% at 2 years and 63% at 4 years. 10,11 The most consistently identified risk factor for the development of post-ablation AF is documented pre-ablation AF, the prevalence of which varies according to the intensity of monitoring, 10-14 Other identified risk factors have included left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, 12,14 significant mitral regurgitation, 10 left atrial (LA) enlargement, 11,15 and the failure of multiple antiarrhyth-mic drugs (AADs). 14 All are associated with LA remodeling and an elevated risk of incident AF regardless of AFL abla-tion. Importantly, the incidence of AF after AFL ablation is also proportional to the intensity of monitoring. In a small study of patients who had loop recorders implanted after flutter ablation, 55% developed new AF within the first year of follow-up. 16 It seems probable that the variability in the reported incidence of post-ablation AF is related in large part to varying intensities of monitoring. In this issue of the Journal, Brembilla-Perrot and colleagues 17 further explore the incidence of and risk factors for AF following ablation of AFL. They present a large single-center series of 1,121 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation of CTI-dependent AFL, with data retrospectively extracted by chart review. A history of AF before AFL ablation was present in 31.8% of patients, but the nature of pre-ablation monitoring to determine this is not described. It is probable that the real AF incidence before ablation was much higher. Follow-up was continued for a mean of 2.1 ± 2.7 years, and included ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring at 1 month but thereafter only at annual intervals or for investigation of symptoms. Using this approach, new AF was observed during follow-up in 19.3% of patients without pre-ablation AF, but ongoing AF was only detected in 31.5% of patients who did have pre-ablation AF. The study thus observed a fall in the overall AF incidence post-ablation (23.2%) compared with pre-ablation (31.8%), with a particularly marked fall in the group with AF before AFL ablation. This result should be viewed in the context of the limited post-ablation monitoring performed. Nevertheless, the ongoing involvement with the healthcare system remained significant with 8% developing permanent AF, 7% requiring electrical cardioversion, 7% atrio-ventricular node ablation and 15% pacemaker implantation. These data certainly make it difficult to argue that AFL ablation in this population provides a definitive result. Only AF history and female gender were significant pre-dictors of AF occurrence post-ablation. Other established markers of AF risk such as age, hypertension, diabetes and various forms of structural heart disease were not associated with post-ablation AF in this study.

We linked Multigeneration Register data on individuals aged 0 to 76 years with Hospital Discharge Register data for 1987-2008 and Outpatient Register data for 2001-2008 to compare AF/AFl risk among relatives of all 300 586 individuals with AF/AFl with that among relatives of unaffected individuals. We used conditional logistic regression to investigate differences in exposure between cases and controls. Parents (odds ratio [OR] 1.95 [95% CI 1.89 to 2.00]) and siblings (OR=3.08 [3.00 to 3.16]) of cases had higher odds of AF/AFl than did parents and siblings of controls. AF/AFl ORs were increased in both sexes. For 2% of cases, both parents had AF/AFl, compared with only 0.7% of controls (OR=3.60 [3.30 to 3.92]). Moreover, 3% of cases had ≥2 siblings with AF/AFl, compared with 1% of controls (OR=5.72 [5.28 to 6.19]). In premature cases (diagnosed at age <50 years), the ORs were 5.04 (4.36 to 5.82) and 8.51 (6.49 to 11.15) for AF/AFl in both parents and AF/AFl in ≥2 siblings, respectively. The overall spouse OR was 1.16 (1.13 to 1.19). Family history of AF/AFl increases the odds of AF/AFl in first-degree relatives. High familial risks were observed in multiplex families.","date":"2013","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"PMID: 23525409\nCitation Key: Zöller2013","volume":"2","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.112.003384","issue":"1","ISSN":"20479980","creators":[{"firstName":"Bengt","lastName":"Zöller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henrik","lastName":"Ohlsson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Sundquist","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristina","lastName":"Sundquist","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["a8572a54-de4e-385d-968b-17fe472ef420"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["a8572a54-de4e-385d-968b-17fe472ef420"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T17:37:16Z","dateModified":"2023-01-07T01:26:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/XWNJBGLE","itemID":2087,"attachments":[{"key":"M7IXKWUR","version":441,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"XWNJBGLE","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["0166f099695d99c57028293b708ff63fc5a2f4d4"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:08Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/M7IXKWUR","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/M7IXKWUR/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2088/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611577,"version":0},"$loki":35},{"itemID":2089,"item":{"key":"YZYQRPFJ","version":441,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Death and thrombo-embolic risk after ablation of atrial flutter compared with atrial fibrillation: A nationwide cohort study","abstractNote":"Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a similar mortality and thrombo-embolic risk, after an atrial ablation procedure, compared with an atrial fibrillation (AF) procedure. Methods and results: Using data from nationwide Danish health registries, we identified patients aged 18–75 years undergoing a first- time atrial flutter or an AF ablation procedure in the period 2000–13. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) after 5 years of follow-up, adjusting for concomitant risk factors. A total of 1096 and 2266 patients underwent an ablation for atrial flutter or AF, respectively. Age distribution was similar in the two, but atrial flutter patients had more co-morbidities. During 5 years of follow-up, we observed 38 and 36 deaths in the atrial flutter and AF groups, corresponding to an almost two-fold higher mortality rate among atrial flutter patients [crude HR 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22–3.03]. The higher mortality rate persisted after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.05–2.69). The rate of thrombo-embolic events was similar in the two groups (crude HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.71–2.56; adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62–2.41). Conclusion: In this observational study, patients with atrial flutter had a significantly higher all-cause mortality rate compared with those with AF after an ablation procedure, but similar thrombo-embolic event rates. Future studies should elucidate the reason for this difference in mortality.","date":"2017-05-01","url":"https://academic.oup.com/europace/article/19/5/838/2194454","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"PMID: 27738075\nPublisher: Oxford Academic\nCitation Key: Vadmann2017","volume":"19","pages":"838-842","publicationTitle":"Europace","DOI":"10.1093/europace/euw107","issue":"5","ISSN":"15322092","creators":[{"firstName":"Henrik","lastName":"Vadmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Gorst-Rasmussen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Søren Pihlkjær","lastName":"Hjortshøj","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Riahi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gregory Y.H.","lastName":"Lip","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Torben Bjerregaard","lastName":"Larsen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Death","type":1},{"tag":"Epidemiology","type":1},{"tag":"Ablation","type":1},{"tag":"Atrial flutter","type":1},{"tag":"Thromboembolism","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["f6fcd5e6-dcec-361f-b116-be707be66ebe"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["f6fcd5e6-dcec-361f-b116-be707be66ebe"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T17:37:33Z","dateModified":"2022-11-23T16:37:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/YZYQRPFJ","itemID":2089,"attachments":[{"key":"WQH5HJGV","version":441,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"YZYQRPFJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["3dcd518b171032a9bd723378b7e8705c33419401"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:09Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WQH5HJGV","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WQH5HJGV/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2090/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611578,"version":0},"$loki":36},{"itemID":2091,"item":{"key":"5LGECLHZ","version":441,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Alcohol intake is significantly associated with atrial flutter in patients under 60 years of age and a shorter right atrial effective refractory period","abstractNote":"Background: Although evidence suggests that alcohol is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), the association between alcohol and atrial flutter (AFL) has not been examined. The mechanism connecting alcohol and atrial arrhythmias is unknown. Methods: Alcohol intake was determined in 195 consecutive patients with AF and AFL. Control subjects included patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias (n = 132) and healthy subjects (n = 54). Because of important competing risk factors for atrial arrhythmias in the elderly, stratification by age was performed. In a subset, atrial effective refractory periods (AERPs) were obtained from the high right atrium and proximal and distal coronary sinus. Results: AF and AFL patients were significantly more likely to be daily alcohol drinkers (27% vs 14% of controls, P = 0.001). In multivariable analysis, AFL patients ≤ 60 years of age were significantly more likely to be daily drinkers than to drink no alcohol compared to controls (odds ratio 17, 95% confidence interval 1.6-192.0, P = 0.019). Progressively more frequent alcohol intake was significantly associated with a progressively greater odds of AFL in patients ≤ 60 years of age (P = 0.045). Neither AF subjects of any age nor AFL subjects > 60 years of age exhibited significant associations with alcohol after multivariable adjustment. Right AERPs shortened significantly with increasing amounts of alcohol intake (P = 0.025), whereas left AERPs were not associated with alcohol intake. Conclusions: Alcohol intake is positively associated with AFL in younger patients. The mechanism may be related to a shortening of the right AERP. © 2008, The Authors.","date":"2008-03","url":"https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.cc.uic.edu/18307620/","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"PMID: 18307620\nPublisher: Pacing Clin Electrophysiol\nCitation Key: Marcus2008","volume":"31","pages":"266-272","publicationTitle":"PACE - Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-8159.2008.00985.x","issue":"3","ISSN":"01478389","creators":[{"firstName":"Gregory M.","lastName":"Marcus","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lisa M.","lastName":"Smith","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dean","lastName":"Whiteman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zian H.","lastName":"Tseng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nitish","lastName":"Badhwar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Byron K.","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Randall J.","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Melvin M.","lastName":"Scheinman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeffrey E.","lastName":"Olgin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"Atrial flutter","type":1},{"tag":"Alcohol","type":1},{"tag":"Atrial effective refratory period (AERP)","type":1},{"tag":"Refractory period","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["44a3c492-b00b-3d33-ae4b-d1f30f882298"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["44a3c492-b00b-3d33-ae4b-d1f30f882298"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T17:43:23Z","dateModified":"2023-03-02T22:15:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/5LGECLHZ","itemID":2091,"attachments":[{"key":"VPHZER9Z","version":441,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"5LGECLHZ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pacing Clinical Electrophis - 2008 - MARCUS - Alcohol Intake is Significantly Associated with Atrial Flutter in Patients.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["fb3e635f29782d38da5457ae3fa36960f72cdc6e"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:10Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/VPHZER9Z","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VPHZER9Z/Pacing Clinical Electrophis - 2008 - MARCUS - Alcohol Intake is Significantly Associated with Atrial Flutter in Patients.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2092/Pacing Clinical Electrophis - 2008 - MARCUS - Alcohol Intake is Significantly Associated with Atrial Flutter in Patients.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611579,"version":0},"$loki":37},{"itemID":2093,"item":{"key":"742W2PVB","version":441,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Contemporary Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Flutter: A Continuum of Atrial Fibrillation and Vice Versa?","abstractNote":"Atrial flutter (AFlu) is usually a fast (>240 bpm) and regular right atrial macroreentrant tachycardia, with a constrained critical region of the reentry circuit located at the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI; typical CTI-dependent AFlu). However, a variety of right and left atrial tachycardias, resulting from different mechanisms, can also present as AFlu (atypical non-CTI-dependent AFlu). The electrocardiogram can provide clues to its origin and location; however, additional entrainment and more sophisticated electroanatomical mapping techniques may be required to identify its mechanism, location, and target area for a successful ablation. Although atrial fibrillation and AFlu are 2 separate arrhythmias, they often coexist before and after drug and/or ablation therapies. Indeed, there appears to be a close interrelationship between these 2 arrhythmias, and one may \"transform\" into the other. These issues are discussed in this overview, and practical algorithms are proposed to guide AFlu localization and illustrate the AFlu and atrial fibrillation continuum.","date":"2017","extra":"PMID: 28832375\nCitation Key: Manolis2017\nISBN: 0000000000000","volume":"25","pages":"289-297","publicationTitle":"Cardiology in Review","DOI":"10.1097/CRD.0000000000000162","issue":"6","ISSN":"15384683","creators":[{"firstName":"Antonis S.","lastName":"Manolis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"stroke","type":1},{"tag":"catheter ablation","type":1},{"tag":"atrial flutter","type":1},{"tag":"antiarrhythmic drugs","type":1},{"tag":"anticoagulation","type":1},{"tag":"cavotricuspid isthmus","type":1},{"tag":"tachycardiomyopathy","type":1},{"tag":"thromboembolism","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["3a7dd2ab-ee0d-4dbe-848b-1e6005af0858"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["51946a54-0196-3cfd-a821-fe420d4876d2"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T17:45:05Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T18:59:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/742W2PVB","itemID":2093,"attachments":[{"key":"CLP9RY7D","version":441,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"742W2PVB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017_Manolis_Contemporary Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Flutter A Continuum of Atrial Fibrillation and Vice Versa.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["4096e622984a80aaa53342cca190034457264a4d"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:11Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/CLP9RY7D","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/CLP9RY7D/2017_Manolis_Contemporary Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Flutter A Continuum of Atrial Fibrillation and Vice Versa.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2094/2017_Manolis_Contemporary Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Flutter A Continuum of Atrial Fibrillation and Vice Versa.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611580,"version":0},"$loki":38},{"itemID":2095,"item":{"key":"3ZCLQEFN","version":441,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Natural History of Lone Atrial Flutter","abstractNote":"Background: The natural history of atrial flutter is not well defined.

BACKGROUND: Although atrial flutter can now be cured, there are no reports on its epidemiology in unselected patients. METHODS: The Marshfield Epidemiological Study Area (MESA), a database that captures nearly all medical care among its 58,820 residents was used to ascertain all new cases of atrial flutter diagnosed from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1995. To identify predisposing risk factors, we employed an age- and gender-matched case-control study design using eight additional variables. RESULTS: A total of 181 new cases of atrial flutter were diagnosed for an overall incidence of 88/100,000 person-years. Incidence rates ranged from 5/100,000 in those <50 years old to 587/100,000 in subjects older than 80. Atrial flutter was 2.5 times more common in men (p < 0.001). The risk of developing atrial flutter increased 3.5 times (p < 0.001) in subjects with heart failure and 1.9 times (p < 0.001) for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among those with atrial flutter 16% were attributable to heart failure and 12% to chronic obstructive lung disease. Three subjects (1.7%) without identifiable predisposing risks were labeled as having 'lone atrial flutter.' CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first population-based investigation of atrial flutter, suggests this curable condition is much more common than previously appreciated. If our findings were applicable to the entire U.S. population, we estimate 200,000 new cases of atrial flutter in this country annually. At highest risk of developing atrial flutter are men, the elderly and individuals with preexisting heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease.

A single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2200733, is strongly associated with AF. We sought to characterize the association between rs2200733 and prevalent Afl and to determine if the variant could predict AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Methods and Results We performed a genetic association study of 295 patients with Afl and/or AF and 469 controls using multivariable logistic regression. The variant was then assessed as a predictor of incident AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in 87 consecutive typical Afl patients with Cox proportional hazards models. The rs2200733 rare allele was associated with an adjusted 2.06-fold increased odds of isolated Afl (95% CI: 1.13-3.76, P = 0.019) and an adjusted 2.79-fold increased odds of a combined phenotype of AF and Afl (95% CI: 1.81-4.28, P < 0.001). Following catheter ablation for Afl, carrier status of rs2200733 failed to predict an increased risk of AF either among all subjects (adjusted HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.58-1.53, P = 0.806) or among those with isolated Afl (adjusted HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.51-3.26, P = 0.585). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that Afl, whether occurring in isolation or along with AF, is associated with the rs2200733 AF risk allele. Genetic carrier status of rs2200733 failed to predict an increased risk of incident or recurrent AF following catheter ablation for Afl. These findings suggest that the causal mechanism associated with rs2200733 is germane to both AF and Afl. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","date":"2014-03-01","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jce.12317","accessDate":"2022-11-22","extra":"PMID: 24237655\nPublisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\nCitation Key: Roberts2014a","volume":"25","pages":"271-277","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/jce.12317","issue":"3","ISSN":"15408167","creators":[{"firstName":"Jason D.","lastName":"Roberts","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan C.","lastName":"Hsu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bradley E.","lastName":"Aouizerat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clive R.","lastName":"Pullinger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mary J.","lastName":"Malloy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John P.","lastName":"Kane","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeffrey E.","lastName":"Olgin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gregory M.","lastName":"Marcus","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"genetics","type":1},{"tag":"catheter ablation","type":1},{"tag":"atrial flutter","type":1},{"tag":"molecular biology","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["eb93203e-9c70-32a6-a620-2c6f7d77fac1"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["eb93203e-9c70-32a6-a620-2c6f7d77fac1"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T20:21:05Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T18:58:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/DE25AZEV","itemID":2099,"attachments":[{"key":"CTZMHP4S","version":442,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jce.12317","parentItem":"DE25AZEV","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T20:21:05Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T18:58:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/CTZMHP4S"},{"key":"UHXUPJ8H","version":442,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jce.12317","parentItem":"DE25AZEV","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-22T20:21:05Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T18:58:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/UHXUPJ8H"},{"key":"7E4CTDUB","version":585,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"DE25AZEV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["af1976dbaceb61b685e70ceb46de2646bc4b85da"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:14Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/7E4CTDUB","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7E4CTDUB/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2102/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611594,"version":0},"$loki":41},{"itemID":2122,"item":{"key":"U7UXBLNX","version":444,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The clinical profile and pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation: relationships among clinical features, epidemiology, and mechanisms.","abstractNote":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia (estimated lifetime risk, 22%-26%). The aim of this article is to review the clinical epidemiological features of AF and to relate them to underlying mechanisms. Long-established risk factors for AF include aging, male sex, hypertension, valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Emerging risk factors include prehypertension, increased pulse pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, high-level physical training, diastolic dysfunction, predisposing gene variants, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. Potential risk factors are coronary artery disease, kidney disease, systemic inflammation, pericardial fat, and tobacco use. AF has substantial population health consequences, including impaired quality of life, increased hospitalization rates, stroke occurrence, and increased medical costs. The pathophysiology of AF centers around 4 general types of disturbances that promote ectopic firing and reentrant mechanisms, and include the following: (1) ion channel dysfunction, (2) Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities, (3) structural remodeling, and (4) autonomic neural dysregulation. Aging, hypertension, valve disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and endurance exercise training all cause structural remodeling. Heart failure and prior atrial infarction also cause Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities that lead to focal ectopic firing via delayed afterdepolarizations/triggered activity. Neural dysregulation is central to atrial arrhythmogenesis associated with endurance exercise training and occlusive coronary artery disease. Monogenic causes of AF typically promote the arrhythmia via ion channel dysfunction, but the mechanisms of the more common polygenic risk factors are still poorly understood and under intense investigation. Better recognition of the clinical epidemiology of AF, as well as an improved appreciation of the underlying mechanisms, is needed to develop improved methods for AF prevention and management.","date":"2014-04-25","extra":"PMID: 24763464\nCitation Key: Andrade2014","volume":"114","pages":"1453-68","publicationTitle":"Circulation research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303211","issue":"9","ISSN":"1524-4571","creators":[{"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Andrade","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Khairy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dobromir","lastName":"Dobrev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stanley","lastName":"Nattel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["cc3efd1b-4784-3b6b-a62f-f12b9e84a286"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["cc3efd1b-4784-3b6b-a62f-f12b9e84a286"]},"dateAdded":"2023-01-02T05:50:10Z","dateModified":"2023-01-02T05:51:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/U7UXBLNX","itemID":2122,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611595,"version":0},"$loki":42},{"itemID":2123,"item":{"key":"BIA3IF68","version":444,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Atrial fibrillation incidence and risk factors in relation to race-ethnicity and the population attributable fraction of atrial fibrillation risk factors: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.","abstractNote":"PURPOSE We studied incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in the prospective community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Reportedly, non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) have a lower AF burden compared with their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. Information on the epidemiology of AF in Hispanic and Asian populations is much more limited. METHODS We excluded participants with a history of AF at enrollment. A total of 6721 MESA participants were monitored for the first AF event ascertained according to hospital discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) of AF were calculated per 1000 person-years of observation. IR ratios were calculated using NHWs as the reference group. Age- and sex-adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) of established modifiable AF risk factors were ascertained. RESULTS In the MESA cohort, 47.2% was male; at baseline, 25.7% had hypertension; 12.5% had diabetes. Three hundred five incident hospitalized AF events occurred over a mean follow-up of 7.3 years. Age- and sex-adjusted IRs and IR ratios showed that overall AF incidence was significantly lower among Hispanics, NHBs and Chinese compared with NHWs (all P < .001). Among participants 65 years of age or greater, Hispanics, Chinese, and blacks had significantly lower AF incidence than NHWs (all P ≤ .01), but IRs were similar among participants under age 65 years. The PAF for smoking was 27% among NHBs but lower among other race-ethnic groups. Among NHWs, the PAF for hypertension was 22.2%, but this was higher among NHBs (33.1%), Chinese (46.3%), and Hispanics (43.9%). CONCLUSIONS Overall, the incidence of hospitalized AF was significantly lower in Hispanics, NHBs, and Chinese than in NHWs. A larger proportion of AF events appear to be attributable to hypertension among nonwhite populations compared with NHWs.","date":"2015-02","extra":"PMID: 25523897\nCitation Key: Rodriguez2015","volume":"25","pages":"71-6, 76.e1","publicationTitle":"Annals of epidemiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.11.024","issue":"2","ISSN":"1873-2585","creators":[{"firstName":"Carlos J","lastName":"Rodriguez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elsayed Z","lastName":"Soliman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Alonso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Swett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter M","lastName":"Okin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David C","lastName":"Goff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan R","lastName":"Heckbert","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["17f70a4e-6f9c-35bb-8500-4aa679f3cfc5"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["17f70a4e-6f9c-35bb-8500-4aa679f3cfc5"]},"dateAdded":"2023-01-02T05:52:44Z","dateModified":"2023-01-02T05:53:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/BIA3IF68","itemID":2123,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611595,"version":0},"$loki":43},{"itemID":2124,"item":{"key":"NF6D7P2V","version":444,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Racial differences in the prevalence of atrial fibrillation among males.","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND Despite being the most common cardiac arrhythmia, little is known about racial differences in atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence and whether differences persist after accounting for known risk factors. METHODS We identified male respondents to the 1999 Large Health Survey of Veteran Enrollees who had an AF diagnosis in the VA administrative database during the preceding two years. RESULTS Of 664,754 male respondents, 5.3% had AF. By race, age-adjusted prevalence was 5.7% in whites, 3.4% in blacks, 3.0% in Hispanics, 5.4% in native Americans/Alaskans, 3.6% in Asians and 5.2% in Pacific Islanders (p<0.001). Of predisposing conditions, whites were more likely to have valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, blacks had the highest hypertension prevalence; Hispanics had the highest diabetes prevalence. Racial differences remained after adjustment for age, body mass index and these comorbidities. White males were significantly more likely to have AF compared to all races but Pacific Islanders [versus blacks, OR=1.84 (95% CI: 1.71-1.98); versus Hispanics, OR=1.77 (1.60-1.97); vs Native Americans, OR 1.15 [1.04-1.27]; versus Asians, OR=1.41 (1.12-1.77) versus Pacific Islanders, OR=1.16 (0.88-1.53)]. CONCLUSIONS AF prevalence varies by race. White males have the highest AF burden even after adjustment for known risk factors. Recognition of the high AF prevalence, especially among whites, as well as native Americans and Pacific Islanders, should help guide provider practices for screening among older male patients. Further research is necessary to verify and establish reasons for these racial differences.","date":"2008-02","extra":"PMID: 18300541\nCitation Key: Borzecki2008","volume":"100","pages":"237-45","publicationTitle":"Journal of the National Medical Association","DOI":"10.1016/s0027-9684(15)31212-8","issue":"2","ISSN":"0027-9684","creators":[{"firstName":"Ann M","lastName":"Borzecki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"D Keith","lastName":"Bridgers","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jane M","lastName":"Liebschutz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Kader","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lewis E","lastName":"Kazis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan R","lastName":"Berlowitz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["00c606db-81f9-3090-b96a-94b291670b11"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["00c606db-81f9-3090-b96a-94b291670b11"]},"dateAdded":"2023-01-02T05:53:36Z","dateModified":"2023-01-02T05:54:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/NF6D7P2V","itemID":2124,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611596,"version":0},"$loki":44},{"itemID":2125,"item":{"key":"KY6MKMHC","version":444,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Atrial flutter: Clinical risk factors and adverse outcomes in the Framingham Heart Study","abstractNote":"Background Few epidemiologic cohort studies have evaluated atrial flutter (flutter) as an arrhythmia distinct from atrial fibrillation (AF).

We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models. Results During mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30% women) developed flutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD, 95% CI 1.03-1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05-4.80) and heart failure (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26-21.64) were associated with incident flutter.

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in candidate genes in ethnic minority probands with early-onset AF and determine genotype-phenotype associations. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort, family-based study, probands of African and Hispanic descent with early-onset AF (defined as AF occurring in individuals aged ≤66 years) prospectively enrolled in a clinical and genetic biorepository underwent sequencing of 60 candidate genes. Recruitment took place from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 1 to February 28, 2020. Exposures: Rare and novel variants categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in African American and Hispanic/Latinx probands with early-onset AF and genotype-phenotype associations. Results: Among 227 probands with early-onset AF, mean (SD) age at onset of AF was 51.0 (9.9) years, 132 probands (58.1%) were men, 148 (65.2%) were African American, and 79 (34.8%) were Hispanic/Latinx. A family history of AF was verified in 24 probands with early-onset AF (10.6%). Sequencing 60 candidate genes identified 53 (23 rare and 30 novel) variants with 16 of the 227 (7.0%) probands harboring likely pathogenic (43.8%) or pathogenic (56.2%) variants, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin (46.7%). In 6 families with more than 2 affected members, variants of unknown significance in sodium channel (SCN10A), potassium channel (KCNE5), sarcomeric proteins (MYH6 and TTN), and atrial natriuretic peptide (NPPA) cosegregated with AF. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants were identified, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, that increase susceptibility to early-onset AF in African American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals. These findings provide further understanding toward molecular phenotyping of AF and suggest novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for this common arrhythmia in ethnic minority groups..","date":"2021-07-01","extra":"PMID: 33950154\nPublisher: American Medical Association\nCitation Key: Chalazan2021","volume":"6","pages":"811-819","publicationTitle":"JAMA Cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2021.0994","issue":"7","ISSN":"23806591","creators":[{"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Chalazan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Denise","lastName":"Mol","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Faisal A.","lastName":"Darbar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Ornelas-Loredo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bahaa","lastName":"Al-Azzam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yining","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tofovic","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Sridhar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zain","lastName":"Alzahrani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Ellinor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dawood","lastName":"Darbar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["4a740516-c822-337f-887c-0fad401452a5"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["4a740516-c822-337f-887c-0fad401452a5"]},"dateAdded":"2023-01-08T16:19:46Z","dateModified":"2023-03-03T05:11:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/FR7ZHVR5","itemID":2127,"attachments":[{"key":"D8Y49LZC","version":444,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"FR7ZHVR5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"chalazan-2021_genetic-variants-afib.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["37469c9ede1ca660c1d72fe9dbec0b40f1051f30"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:51:27Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:51:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/D8Y49LZC","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/D8Y49LZC/chalazan-2021_genetic-variants-afib.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2128/chalazan-2021_genetic-variants-afib.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611600,"version":0},"$loki":46},{"itemID":2148,"item":{"key":"9FU5D49Z","version":446,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Under-Reporting and Under-Representation of Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Major Atrial Fibrillation Clinical Trials","date":"2020-06","extra":"Citation Key: Sarraju2020","volume":"6","pages":"739-741","publicationTitle":"JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacep.2020.03.001","issue":"6","ISSN":"2405500X","creators":[{"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Sarraju","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David J.","lastName":"Maron","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fatima","lastName":"Rodriguez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["4740f439-b02b-3cb0-b8bb-db986b64a6f3"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["4740f439-b02b-3cb0-b8bb-db986b64a6f3"]},"dateAdded":"2023-03-02T23:16:28Z","dateModified":"2023-03-02T23:17:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9FU5D49Z","itemID":2148,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611601,"version":0},"$loki":47},{"itemID":2149,"item":{"key":"LEH64FIG","version":446,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The paradox of atrial fibrillation in African Americans.","abstractNote":"The reported lower prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) despite the higher prevalence of AF risk factors in African Americans compared to Caucasian whites has been referred to as the paradox of AF in African Americans.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between PTFV1 components (duration and amplitude) and incident AF and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods: The study included patients with an ECG recorded at the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory in 2001 to 2011. PTFV1 ≥4 mV·ms was considered abnormal. Patients with abnormal PTFV1 were stratified into tertiles based on duration (PTDV1) and amplitude (PTAV1) values. Cox regressions adjusted for age, sex, and relevant comorbidities were used to investigate associations between abnormal PTFV1 components and AF and stroke/TIA. Results: Of 267,636 patients, 5803 had AF and 18,176 had stroke/TIA (follow-up 6.5 years). Abnormal PTFV1 was present in 44,549 subjects (16.7%) and was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Among patients with abnormal PTFV1, the highest tertile of PTDV1 (78–97 ms) was associated with the highest risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–1.52) and highest risk of stroke/TIA (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05 –1.20). For PTAV1, the highest tertile (78–126 μV) conferred the highest risk of AF and stroke/TIA (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09–1.32; and HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.14–1.25, respectively). Conclusion: Abnormal PTFV1 was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Increasing PTDV1 showed a dose–response relationship with the development of AF and stroke/TIA, whereas the association between PTAV1 and AF was less apparent.","date":"2023-03-01","extra":"PMID: 36435351\nPublisher: Elsevier B.V.\nCitation Key: wolder2023","volume":"20","pages":"354-362","publicationTitle":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.11.010","issue":"3","ISSN":"15563871","creators":[{"firstName":"Lecia Dixen","lastName":"Wolder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Graff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kirstine H.","lastName":"Baadsgaard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monica Lykke","lastName":"Langgaard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christoffer","lastName":"Polcwiartek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Ji-Young Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Morten Wagner","lastName":"Skov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Torp-Pedersen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel J.","lastName":"Friedman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Atwater","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thure Filskov","lastName":"Overvad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonas Bille","lastName":"Nielsen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Steen Moeller","lastName":"Hansen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Sogaard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristian H.","lastName":"Kragholm","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Electrocardiography","type":1},{"tag":"Stroke","type":1},{"tag":"Atrial fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"Atrial flutter","type":1},{"tag":"P terminal force","type":1}],"collections":["K2FHPDEZ"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["6dd7fbff-d7dc-348c-9dae-e3339c71eb53"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["6dd7fbff-d7dc-348c-9dae-e3339c71eb53"]},"dateAdded":"2023-05-22T13:29:20Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T21:02:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/VQB6I9QI","itemID":2204,"attachments":[{"key":"M3L3GBXV","version":452,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"VQB6I9QI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1-s2.0-S1547527122026728.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["0cd7f4286e1847288edb478b1c94ec8e0c4a2d75"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:52:09Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:52:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/M3L3GBXV","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/M3L3GBXV/1-s2.0-S1547527122026728.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2205/1-s2.0-S1547527122026728.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611607,"version":0},"$loki":51},{"itemID":2870,"item":{"key":"LQLV69AA","version":832,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Progression to chronic atrial fibrillation after the initial diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Results from the Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation","abstractNote":"Background\nAfter its initial diagnosis, atrial fibrillation (AF) may progress from paroxysmal to chronic AF (CAF).

This study aimed to elucidate the incidences of AF recurrence and of progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF, after CA, in patients with paroxysmal AF.\n\nMethods and Results—\n\nWe examined the incidence of AF recurrence and AF progression in 1220 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 years), with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, undergoing CA, based on extensive pulmonary vein isolation and focal ablation for nonpulmonary vein foci. AF recurrence–free survival probabilities at 5 years were 59.4% after the initial CA and 81.1% after the final CA (average, 1.3 procedures). During a median follow-up period of 47.9 (range, 5.3–123.3) months after the initial CA, AF progressed from paroxysmal to persistent in 15 (1.2%) patients (0.3%/y). The duration of AF history (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; P<0.0001), number of ineffective antiarrhythmics (HR, 1.09; P=0.005), and left atrial diameter indexed by the body surface area (HR, 1.05; P=0.001) were significant predictors of AF recurrence.

A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of β-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient β-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and β-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p < 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p < 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p < 0.01). There was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient β-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.61, p < 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (Rs = 0.64, p < 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31% for insulin resistance and 32% for β-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.","date":"1985","extra":"PMID: 3899825\nCitation Key: Matthews1985","volume":"28","pages":"412-419","publicationTitle":"Diabetologia","DOI":"10.1007/BF00280883","issue":"7","ISSN":"0012186X","creators":[{"firstName":"D.

The clinical outcomes associated with heart failure are considerably worse for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes mellitus. In people with diabetes mellitus, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, has led to the descriptive terminology, diabetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy is increasing in parallel with the increase in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is initially characterized by myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and associated diastolic dysfunction, later by systolic dysfunction, and eventually by clinical heart failure. Impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevations in advanced glycation end products and collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities have all been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Molecular mechanisms linked to the underlying pathophysiological changes include abnormalities in AMP-Activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-Activated receptors, O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine, protein kinase C, microRNA, and exosome pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a contemporary view of these instigators of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as mechanistically based strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.","date":"2018-02-01","accessDate":"2020-06-16","extra":"PMID: 29449364\nPublisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins\nCitation Key: Jia2018","volume":"122","pages":"624-638","publicationTitle":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311586","issue":"4","ISSN":"15244571","creators":[{"firstName":"Guanghong","lastName":"Jia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael A.","lastName":"Hill","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James R.","lastName":"Sowers","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cardiac","type":1},{"tag":"Heart failure","type":1},{"tag":"Diabetes mellitus","type":1},{"tag":"Myocytes","type":1},{"tag":"Proxisome proliferator-Activated receptors","type":1},{"tag":"Renin-Angiotensin system","type":1}],"collections":["HPPM5WXR"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["e5a71f6d-26af-3c46-8aff-9e1d37f75e67"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["e5a71f6d-26af-3c46-8aff-9e1d37f75e67"]},"dateAdded":"2020-06-16T15:03:41Z","dateModified":"2020-06-16T15:29:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/A5S8RSUD","itemID":1597,"attachments":[{"key":"Y9FHGHUP","version":392,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"A5S8RSUD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["2b484821ce55a8a5b66452449e8c40e85d8302dd"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:46:31Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:46:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/Y9FHGHUP","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Y9FHGHUP/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1598/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611615,"version":0},"$loki":57},{"itemID":1599,"item":{"key":"E7WQQSU6","version":392,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Diabetes-associated cardiac fibrosis: Cellular effectors, molecular mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities","abstractNote":"Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with cardiac fibrosis that may reduce myocardial compliance, contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure, and trigger arrhythmic events. Diabetes-associated fibrosis is mediated by activated cardiac fibroblasts, but may also involve fibrogenic actions of macrophages, cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. The molecular basis responsible for cardiac fibrosis in diabetes remains poorly understood. Hyperglycemia directly activates a fibrogenic program, leading to accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that crosslink extracellular matrix proteins, and transduce fibrogenic signals through reactive oxygen species generation, or through activation of Receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-mediated pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may recruit fibrogenic leukocyte subsets in the cardiac interstitium. Activation of transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling may activate fibroblasts inducing deposition of structural extracellular matrix proteins and matricellular macromolecules. Adipokines, endothelin-1 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have also been implicated in the diabetic myocardium. This manuscript reviews our current understanding of the cellular effectors and molecular pathways that mediate fibrosis in diabetes. Based on the pathophysiologic mechanism, we propose therapeutic interventions that may attenuate the diabetes-associated fibrotic response and discuss the challenges that may hamper clinical translation.","date":"2016","accessDate":"2020-06-16","extra":"Citation Key: Russo2016","volume":"90","pages":"84-93","publicationTitle":"Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.011","ISSN":"10958584","creators":[{"firstName":"Ilaria","lastName":"Russo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nikolaos G","lastName":"Frangogiannis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heart failure","type":1},{"tag":"Obesity","type":1},{"tag":"Diabetes","type":1},{"tag":"Fibroblast","type":1},{"tag":"Fibrosis","type":1}],"collections":["HPPM5WXR"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["8f543546-4823-3d33-a13c-69956c04d726"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["8f543546-4823-3d33-a13c-69956c04d726"]},"dateAdded":"2020-06-16T15:04:24Z","dateModified":"2020-06-16T15:29:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/E7WQQSU6","itemID":1599,"attachments":[{"key":"A3D3HG6K","version":392,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"E7WQQSU6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["943295bfd31629556e76ba1d8d6aba0db98f8ca0"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:46:32Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:46:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/A3D3HG6K","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/A3D3HG6K/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1600/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611616,"version":0},"$loki":58},{"itemID":713,"item":{"key":"L8PEVINM","version":303,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heart rate variability density analysis (Dyx) for identification of appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients among elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction","abstractNote":"AIMS: Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) density analysis specifically designed to identify patients at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction ≤40% after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24%) had a Dyx ≤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age >70 years and QRS > 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

The increasing incidence of diabetes in young individuals is particularly worrisome given that the disease is likely to evolve over a period of years. In 1972, the existence of a diabetic cardiomyopathy was proposed based on the experience with four adult diabetic patients who suffered from congestive heart failure in the absence of discernible coronary artery disease, valvular or congenital heart disease, hypertension, or alcoholism. The exact mechanisms underlying the disease are unknown; however, an important component of the pathological alterations observed in these hearts includes the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in particular collagens. The excess deposition of ECM in the heart mirrors what occurs in other organs such as the kidney and peritoneum of diabetics. Mechanisms responsible for these alterations may include the excess production, reduced degradation, and/or chemical modification of ECM proteins. These effects may be the result of direct or indirect actions of high glucose concentrations. This article reviews our state of knowledge on the effects that diabetes-like conditions exert on the cells responsible for ECM production as well as relevant experimental and clinical data. © 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.","date":"2006-02-21","accessDate":"2020-06-04","extra":"Publisher: Journal of the American College of Cardiology\nCitation Key: Asbun2006","volume":"47","pages":"693-700","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.050","issue":"4","ISSN":"07351097","creators":[{"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Asbun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Francisco J.","lastName":"Villarreal","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["WLNKFTMA"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["0b77d42b-3bd9-3393-ad35-25fa51daf272"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["0b77d42b-3bd9-3393-ad35-25fa51daf272"]},"dateAdded":"2020-06-05T03:09:42Z","dateModified":"2020-06-05T03:10:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/DLAHA7DJ","itemID":1580,"attachments":[{"key":"HJK9EHWM","version":390,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"DLAHA7DJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["6349a3d4ab18616771dc925fe43928108ea577c7"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:46:24Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:46:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/HJK9EHWM","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/HJK9EHWM/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1581/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611661,"version":0},"$loki":60},{"itemID":1682,"item":{"key":"5DIW8VQZ","version":400,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"International Expert Consensus Document on Takotsubo Syndrome (Part II): Diagnostic Workup, Outcome, and Management","abstractNote":"The clinical expert consensus statement on takotsubo syndrome (TTS) part II focuses on the diagnostic workup, outcome, and management.

It is precipitated by extreme stress and can be triggered by intravenous catecholamine administration, particularly epinephrine. Despite its grave presentation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rapidly reversible, with generally good prognosis. We hypothesized that this represents switching of epinephrine signaling through the pleiotropic β 2-adrenergic receptor (β 2AR) from canonical stimulatory G-protein-activated cardiostimulant to inhibitory G-protein-activated cardiodepressant pathways. Methods and Results-We describe an in vivo rat model in which a high intravenous epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, bolus produces the characteristic reversible apical depression of myocardial contraction coupled with basal hypercontractility. The effect is prevented via Gi inactivation by pertussis toxin pretreatment. β 2AR number and functional responses were greater in isolated apical cardiomyocytes than in basal cardiomyocytes, which confirmed the higher apical sensitivity and response to circulating epinephrine. In vitro studies demonstrated high-dose epinephrine can induce direct cardiomyocyte cardiodepression and cardioprotection in a β 2AR- Gi-dependent manner. Preventing epinephrine-Gi effects increased mortality in the Takotsubo model, whereas β-blockers that activate β 2AR- Gi exacerbated the epinephrine-dependent negative inotropic effects without further deaths. In contrast, levosimendan rescued the acute cardiac dysfunction without increased mortality. Conclusions-We suggest that biased agonism of epinephrine for β 2AR-Gs at low concentrations and for Gi at high concentrations underpins the acute apical cardiodepression observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with an apical-basal gradient in β 2ARs explaining the differential regional responses. We suggest this epinephrine-specific β 2AR-Gi signaling may have evolved as a cardioprotective strategy to limit catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity during acute stress. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.","date":"2012-08-07","url":"/pmc/articles/PMC4890655/?report=abstract","accessDate":"2020-09-20","extra":"PMID: 22732314\nPublisher: Europe PMC Funders\nCitation Key: Paur2012","volume":"126","pages":"697-706","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.111591","issue":"6","ISSN":"00097322","creators":[{"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Paur","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter T.","lastName":"Wright","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Markus B.","lastName":"Sikkel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew H.","lastName":"Tranter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Mansfield","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"O'Gara","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel J.","lastName":"Stuckey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viacheslav O.","lastName":"Nikolaev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Diakonov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Pannell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Gong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicholas S.","lastName":"Peters","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Petrou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhaolun","lastName":"Zheng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Gorelik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander R.","lastName":"Lyon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sian E.","lastName":"Harding","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Takotsubo syndrome","type":1},{"tag":"catecholamines","type":1},{"tag":"adrenergic","type":1},{"tag":"beta","type":1},{"tag":"acute heart failure","type":1},{"tag":"receptors","type":1}],"collections":["WLNKFTMA"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["2f2ee00d-e2f4-3599-a62d-5df0e92f3c83"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["2f2ee00d-e2f4-3599-a62d-5df0e92f3c83"]},"dateAdded":"2020-09-20T23:37:53Z","dateModified":"2020-10-15T01:49:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/5WYMTZAR","itemID":1687,"attachments":[{"key":"DL5RF7HS","version":401,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4890655/","parentItem":"5WYMTZAR","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-09-20T23:37:53Z","dateModified":"2020-10-15T01:49:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/DL5RF7HS"},{"key":"M4BJ654B","version":401,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"5WYMTZAR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["757dfd4f26bc1010ca41a55b6376b4cf9c21130c"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:10Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:47:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/M4BJ654B","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/M4BJ654B/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1689/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611663,"version":0},"$loki":62},{"itemID":711,"item":{"key":"W6LY3ZUN","version":303,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heart Rate Variability Density Analysis (Dyx) and Prediction of Long-Term Mortality after Acute Myocardial Infarction.","abstractNote":"AIMS:The density HRV parameter Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) measure based on multipole analysis of the Poincaré plot obtained from RR interval time series, deriving information from both the time and frequency domain. Preliminary results have suggested that the parameter may provide new predictive information on mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study compares the prognostic significance of Dyx to that of traditional linear and nonlinear measures of HRV.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:In the Nordic ICD pilot study, patients with an acute MI were screened with 2D echocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P < 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02). Reduced Dyx also predicted cardiovascular death (P < 0.01) and sudden cardiovascular death (P = 0.05).

In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.","date":"1999-12","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-abstract/41/1/41/317013","accessDate":"2018-09-27","extra":"PMID: 8681998\nCitation Key: Armour1999","volume":"16","pages":"1751-2","publicationTitle":"European heart journal","issue":"12","ISSN":"0195-668X","creators":[{"firstName":"J Andrew","lastName":"Armour","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"myocardial ischemia","type":1},{"tag":"dorsal root ganglion afferent","type":1},{"tag":"intrinsic cardiac nervous system","type":1},{"tag":"local circuit neurone","type":1},{"tag":"neurone","type":1},{"tag":"nodose ganglion afferent","type":1},{"tag":"parasympathetic efferent neurone","type":1},{"tag":"sympathetic efferent neurone","type":1}],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["78a5c08d-4413-4a17-bdd2-71274e1650f6"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["ff241968-f341-33d2-914b-b74274389a4c"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-23T00:18:31Z","dateModified":"2019-10-23T00:18:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/T2U7NJXQ","itemID":1029,"attachments":[{"key":"THB9PRC7","version":335,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8681998","parentItem":"T2U7NJXQ","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-23T00:18:31Z","dateModified":"2019-10-23T00:18:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/THB9PRC7"},{"key":"3ZC5WU2X","version":495,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"T2U7NJXQ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1999 - Armour - Myocardial ischaemia and the cardiac nervous system.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["ce7438c4717700828d363e632cdde9505bca6b45"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:43:02Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:43:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/3ZC5WU2X","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3ZC5WU2X/1999 - Armour - Myocardial ischaemia and the cardiac nervous system.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1031/1999 - Armour - Myocardial ischaemia and the cardiac nervous system.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611666,"version":0},"$loki":65},{"itemID":1080,"item":{"key":"HKBTVHPQ","version":340,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A novel heart rate variability algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia: pilot data from a prospective clinical trial.","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been shown to be a predictor of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15% had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85%), PPV (50%) and NPV (97%) as compared to standard EST (53%, 42%, 90%, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86% and 85%, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients > 65 years of age.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a novel short-term HRV algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD. We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38% were women, 51% had hypertension, and 25% diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77%) compared with standard EST (27%). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p <0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73% versus 26%. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.","date":"2015","accessDate":"2017-09-26","extra":"PMID: 25872904\nCitation Key: Goldkorn2015b","volume":"115","pages":"1518-1522","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.02.054","issue":"11","ISSN":"18791913","creators":[{"firstName":"Ronen","lastName":"Goldkorn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Naimushin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nir","lastName":"Shlomo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ariella","lastName":"Dan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Oieru","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Moalem","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eli","lastName":"Rozen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Gur","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Levitan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Rosenmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yakov","lastName":"Mogilewsky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Klempfner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Goldenberg","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["b7f7cf94-e8eb-4716-aad5-1e8ffb1c631e"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["8a082a95-9d44-3bd4-ac53-510c832f98bb"]},"dateAdded":"2019-11-13T03:48:08Z","dateModified":"2019-11-13T03:48:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/HHJU4EUS","itemID":1082,"attachments":[{"key":"9N43X6QQ","version":340,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","url":"https://ac-els-cdn-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/S000291491500898X/1-s2.0-S000291491500898X-main.pdf?_tid=6dcdce40-a31f-11e7-a283-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1506474284_e7b6913530ad6e0b9cd4b3c10e770803","parentItem":"HHJU4EUS","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"m-api-1e763cff-a274-11b3-39fb-6459aa522415.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["0179fb3bd15e125a1b1b6c57cc76b47897e099a5"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:43:14Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:43:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9N43X6QQ","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/9N43X6QQ/m-api-1e763cff-a274-11b3-39fb-6459aa522415.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1083/m-api-1e763cff-a274-11b3-39fb-6459aa522415.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611668,"version":0},"$loki":67},{"itemID":1085,"item":{"key":"MUJBQB9H","version":341,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The changing face of cardiovascular disease 2000–2012: An analysis of the world health organisation global health estimates data","abstractNote":"The pattern and global burden of disease has evolved considerably over the last two decades, from primarily communicable, maternal, and perinatal causes to non-communicable disease (NCD).

IHD was also the greatest single cause of death in 2000, accounting for an estimated 6.0 million deaths. The global burden of CVD falls, principally, on the low and middle-income (LMI) countries, accounting for over 80% of CVD deaths.

The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke produce immense health and economic burdens in the United States and globally. The Update also presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease [CHD], heart failure [HF], valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Since 2007, the annual versions of the Statistical Update have been cited >20 000 times in the literature. From January to July 2017 alone, the 2017 Statistical Update was accessed >106 500 times. Each annual version of the Statistical Update undergoes revisions to include the newest nationally representative data, add additional relevant published scientific findings, remove older information, add new sections or chapters, and increase the number of ways to access and use the assembled information. This year-long process, which begins as soon as the previous Statistical Update is published, is performed by the AHA Statistics Committee faculty volunteers and staff and government agency partners. This year's edition includes new data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, new metrics to assess and monitor healthy diets, new information on stroke in young adults, an enhanced focus on underserved and minority populations, a substantively expanded focus on the global burden of CVD, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals.

To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·80 (SD 0·03) compared with 0·67 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·69 (0·04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·74 (0·03) compared with 0·60 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·64 (0·03) for SDNN (p<0·0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p<0·0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors. Aminophylline decreased the severity of adenosine-induced chest pain (assessed with a visual analog scale) from 42 +/- 22 to 23 +/- 17 mm (p less than 0.002). In the remaining five of the 22 patients, monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in the coronary sinus during intracoronary adenosine administration showed that maximum coronary vasodilation was achieved at doses lower than those responsible for chest pain.

The risk of cardiac events is increased during morning hours. Studying the contributions of autonomic mechanisms may yield insights into risk stratification and treatment. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction, measured by decreased heart rate variability (HRV), associates with abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of the association between abnormal myocardial stress perfusion with HRV using 276 middle-aged veteran twins without known ischemic heart disease. The primary independent variable was cardiac autonomic regulation measured with 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using linear and non-linear (multipole density, or Dyx) HRV metrics. The primary outcome was abnormal perfusion (>5% affected myocardium) during adenosine stress on [13N]-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 53 (3) years and 55 (20%) had abnormal perfusion. HRV (by Dyx) was reduced during morning hours in subjects with abnormal perfusion. At 7 AM, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in Dyx was associated a 4.8 (95% CI, 1.5 - 15.8) odds ratio (OR) for abnormal MPI. With Dyx < 2.0, the 7 AM OR for abnormal MPI was 11.8 (95% CI, 1.2 - 111.4). CONCLUSIONS Autonomic dysfunction, measured by non-linear HRV in the morning hours, was associated with an increased OR of abnormal MPI. These results suggest a potentially important role of ECG-based biomarkers in risk stratification for individuals with suspected ischemic heart disease.","date":"2020-04-15","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167527319355214","rights":"All rights reserved","extra":"PMID: 32024598\nPublisher: Elsevier Ireland Ltd\nCitation Key: Shah2020","volume":"305","pages":"99-105","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.01.069","ISSN":"1874-1754","creators":[{"firstName":"Anish S","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Lampert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

The distribution of monoaminergic terminals in the arterial wall depends on the diameter of the artery. In large arteries, the terminals are regularly distributed around the entire circumference, the fibres being situated between the elastic lamellae of the adventitia. The terminals within the media could not be detected. In small arteries, the sympathetic ground plexus aggregates in two parallel strands, the artery being between them. In arterioles, two thick fibres only accompany the vellel. The myocardium is innervated by means of a three-dimensional sympathetic ground plexus distributed between the myocardial cells independently of vessels. No difference in density of innervation was found between the right and left heart. The point-counting method, on the other hand, has revealed that the density of innervation in the left auricle is nearly twice as dense as in the left ventricle. The terminals innervating the myocardium are markedly thinner than the fibres innervating the arteries. Two-dimensional plexuses innervate the epicardium, endocardium and valves.","date":"1978","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/619505","accessDate":"2019-05-28","extra":"PMID: 619505\nCitation Key: Dolezel1978","volume":"100","pages":"306-16","publicationTitle":"Acta anatomica","issue":"3","ISSN":"0001-5180","creators":[{"firstName":"S","lastName":"Dolezel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M","lastName":"Gerová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J","lastName":"Gero","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T","lastName":"Sládek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J","lastName":"Vasku","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J8EASI8X","NZ487Z5E"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["5a1acb05-31dc-4c09-a678-ac1d35fb4e2c"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["80fe2e9c-3892-3af6-962f-3c89c9bf0b24"]},"dateAdded":"2020-03-26T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2020-03-26T16:50:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/P8M9P5ZB","itemID":1464,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611674,"version":0},"$loki":74},{"itemID":1637,"item":{"key":"UK2XZ5KI","version":396,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The Evolving Role of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in the Management of Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association","abstractNote":"Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT). The purpose of this report is to review the known prevalence and potential importance of coronary artery disease in patients with OHCA and to describe the emerging paradigm of treatment with advanced perfusion/reperfusion techniques and their potential benefits on the basis of available evidence. Although randomized clinical trials are planned or ongoing, current scientific evidence rests principally on observational case series with their potential confounding selection bias. Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70% to 85%. More than 90% of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25% to 50%. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10% to 15% absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9% to 45% in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.","date":"2019-03-19","url":"http://ahajournals.org","accessDate":"2020-08-26","extra":"PMID: 30760026\nPublisher: NLM (Medline)\nCitation Key: Yannopoulos2019","volume":"139","pages":"e530-e552","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIR.0000000000000630","issue":"12","ISSN":"15244539","creators":[{"firstName":"Demetris","lastName":"Yannopoulos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jason A.","lastName":"Bartos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tom P.","lastName":"Aufderheide","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clifton W.","lastName":"Callaway","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rajat","lastName":"Deo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Garcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henry R.","lastName":"Halperin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karl B.","lastName":"Kern","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter J.","lastName":"Kudenchuk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert W.","lastName":"Neumar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Raveendran","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"tachycardia","type":1},{"tag":"ventricular","type":1},{"tag":"ventricular fibrillation","type":1},{"tag":"AHA Scientific Statements","type":1},{"tag":"cardiac catheterization","type":1},{"tag":"laboratories","type":1},{"tag":"out-of-hospital cardiac arrest","type":1},{"tag":"percutaneous coronary intervention","type":1}],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["57b30ec6-0891-39fe-abbe-2a72d07386b0"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["57b30ec6-0891-39fe-abbe-2a72d07386b0"]},"dateAdded":"2020-08-26T11:05:46Z","dateModified":"2020-08-27T23:25:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/UK2XZ5KI","itemID":1637,"attachments":[{"key":"43NUA4I7","version":497,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"UK2XZ5KI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["16ea658d66d868f1c3b47c5123b937ce50383638"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:46:45Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:46:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/43NUA4I7","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/43NUA4I7/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1638/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611676,"version":0},"$loki":75},{"itemID":1767,"item":{"key":"VIPBM89S","version":409,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Inflammation is related to coronary flow reserve detected by positron emission tomography in asymptomatic male twins","abstractNote":"Objectives: This study sought to examine the relationship between inflammation and coronary microvascular function in asymptomatic individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio <2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p < 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of <2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors.

We sought to determine the long-term associations of various LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) thresholds and CVD and coronary heart disease mortality in a large, low 10-year risk cohort. Methods: The study sample included participants of the CCLS (Cooper Center Longitudinal Study) without a history of CVD or diabetes mellitus and defined as low risk (<7.5%) for 10-year atherosclerotic CVD events at baseline based on Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. The associations of fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In 36 375 participants (72% men, median age 42) followed for a median of 26.8 years, 1086 CVD and 598 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. Compared with LDL-C <100 mg/dL, LDL-C categories 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, 160 to 189.9 mg/dL, and ≥190 mg/dL were associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.7), 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.4), and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3-2.3), and mean reductions in years free of CVD death of 1.8, 1.1, 4.3, and 3.9, respectively. After adjustment for atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, LDL-C categories 160 to 189 mg/dL and ≥190 mg/dL remained independently associated with CVD mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.2) and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-2.1), respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models using non-HDL-C <130 mg/dL as the reference, non-HDL-C 160 to 189 mg/dL, 190 to 219 mg/dL, and ≥220 mg/dL were significantly associated with CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.8 (95% CI, 1.4-2.2), and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-2.0), respectively. Restricting the cohort to those with 10-year risk <5% did not diminish the associations of LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality. Conclusions: In a low 10-year risk cohort with long-term follow-up, LDL-C and non-HDL-C ≥160 mg/dL were independently associated with a 50% to 80% increased relative risk of CVD mortality. These findings may have implications for future cholesterol treatment paradigms.","date":"2018-11-20","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30571575/","accessDate":"2021-04-02","extra":"PMID: 30571575\nPublisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins\nCitation Key: Abdullah2018","volume":"138","pages":"2315-2325","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034273","issue":"21","ISSN":"15244539","creators":[{"firstName":"Shuaib M.","lastName":"Abdullah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura F.","lastName":"Defina","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Leonard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carolyn E.","lastName":"Barlow","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nina B.","lastName":"Radford","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin L.","lastName":"Willis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Rohatgi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Darren K.","lastName":"McGuire","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James A.","lastName":"De Lemos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Scott M.","lastName":"Grundy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jarett D.","lastName":"Berry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Khera","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"long-term follow-up","type":1},{"tag":"low-density lipoprotein","type":1},{"tag":"primary prevention","type":1}],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["bed18efd-fdfe-3b43-9c02-f4f9baa3eb21"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["bed18efd-fdfe-3b43-9c02-f4f9baa3eb21"]},"dateAdded":"2021-04-02T23:56:26Z","dateModified":"2021-04-03T00:03:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/FQRGEKHJ","itemID":1787,"attachments":[{"key":"7775L3KS","version":577,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"FQRGEKHJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["d6cccc88f69a22bc8c6e7373e69662295e476f1b"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:59Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:48:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/7775L3KS","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/7775L3KS/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1788/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611678,"version":0},"$loki":77},{"itemID":1908,"item":{"key":"6EA3DXZH","version":423,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heart Rate Variability for Risk Assessment of Myocardial Ischemia in Patients Without Known Coronary Artery Disease: The HRV‐DETECT (Heart Rate Variability for the Detection of Myocardial Ischemia) Study","abstractNote":"Background Detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population is complex and relies on combined assessment of traditional CAD risk factors and noninvasive testing. We hypothesized that a CAD-specific heart rate variability (HRV) algorithm can be used to improve detection of subclinical or early ischemia in patients without known CAD. Methods and Results Between 2014 and 2018 we prospectively enrolled 1043 patients with low to intermediate pretest probability for CAD who were screened for myocardial ischemia in tertiary medical centers in the United States and Israel. Patients underwent 1-hour Holter testing, with immediate HRV analysis using the HeartTrends DyDx algorithm, followed by exercise stress echocardiography (n=612) or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (n=431). The threshold for low HRV was identified using receiver operating characteristic analysis based on sensitivity and specificity. The primary end point was the presence of myocardial ischemia detected by exercise stress echocardiography or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The mean age of patients was 61 years and 38% were women. Myocardial ischemia was detected in 66 (6.3%) patients. After adjustment for CAD risk factors and exercise stress testing results, low HRV was independently associated with a significant 2-fold increased likelihood for myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.41-2.89 [P=0.01]). Adding HRV to traditional CAD risk factors significantly improved the pretest probability for myocardial ischemia. Conclusions Our data from a large prospective international clinical study show that short-term HRV testing can be used as a novel digital-health modality for enhanced risk assessment in low- to intermediate-risk individuals without known CAD.

Certain brain regions that control both emotional states and cardiac physiology may be involved in this relationship. The rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) is an important brain region that processes stress and regulates immune and autonomic functions. Changes in rmPFC activity with emotional stress (reactivity) may be informative of future risk for MACE. Methods: Participants with stable coronary artery disease underwent acute mental stress testing using a series of standardized speech/arithmetic stressors and simultaneous brain imaging with high-resolution positron emission tomography brain imaging. We defined high rmPFC activation as a difference between stress and control scans greater than the median value for the entire cohort. Interleukin-6 levels 90 minutes after stress, and high-frequency heart rate variability during stress were also assessed. We defined MACE as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. Results: We studied 148 subjects (69% male) with mean±SD age of 62±8 years. After adjustment for baseline demographics, risk factors, and baseline levels of interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability, higher rmPFC stress reactivity was independently associated with higher interleukin-6 and lower high-frequency heart rate variability with stress. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 34 subjects (21.3%) experienced a MACE. Each increase of 1 SD in rmPFC activation with mental stress was associated with a 21% increase risk of MACE (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.37]). Stress-induced interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability explained 15.5% and 32.5% of the relationship between rmPFC reactivity and MACE, respectively. Addition of rmPFC reactivity to conventional risk factors improved risk reclassification for MACE prediction, and C-statistic improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P=0.03). Conclusions: Greater rmPFC stress reactivity is associated with incident MACE. Immune and autonomic responses to mental stress may play a contributory role.","date":"2020-08-04","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044442","accessDate":"2022-06-10","extra":"PMID: 32522022\nPublisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins\nCitation Key: Moazzami2020","volume":"142","pages":"455-465","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044442","issue":"5","ISSN":"15244539","creators":[{"firstName":"Kasra","lastName":"Moazzami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew T.","lastName":"Wittbrodt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bruno B.","lastName":"Lima","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathon A.","lastName":"Nye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Puja K.","lastName":"Mehta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brad D.","lastName":"Pearce","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zakaria","lastName":"Almuwaqqat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleksiy","lastName":"Levantsevych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan V.","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Raggi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernest V.","lastName":"Garcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Margarethe","lastName":"Goetz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arshed A.","lastName":"Quyyumi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Methods and Results - We identified 5183 consecutive patients who underwent stress/rest SPECT and were followed up for the occurrence of cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Over a mean follow up of 642±226 days, 119 cardiac deaths and 158 myocardial infarctions occurred (3.0% cardiac death rate, 2.3% myocardial infarction rate). Patients with normal scans were at low risk (≤0.5%/y), and rates of both outcomes increased significantly with worsening scan abnormalities. Patients who underwent exercise stress and had mildly abnormal scans had low rates of cardiac death but higher rates of myocardial infarction (0.7%/y versus 2.6%/y; P<.05). After adjustment for prescan information, scan results provided incremental prognostic value toward the prediction of cardiac death. The identification of patients at intermediate risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and low risk for cardiac death by SPECT may result in significant cost savings when applied to a clinical testing strategy. Conclusions - Myocardial perfusion SPECT yields incremental prognostic information toward the identification of cardiac death. Patients with mildly abnormal scans after exercise stress are at low risk for cardiac death but intermediate risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction and thus may benefit from a noninvasive strategy and may not require invasive management.","date":"1998-02-17","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.CIR.97.6.535","accessDate":"2022-06-10","extra":"PMID: 9494023\nPublisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins\nCitation Key: Hachamovitch1998","volume":"97","pages":"535-543","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.97.6.535","issue":"6","ISSN":"00097322","creators":[{"firstName":"Rory","lastName":"Hachamovitch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel S.","lastName":"Berman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Leslee J.","lastName":"Shaw","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hosen","lastName":"Kiat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ishac","lastName":"Cohen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Arthur Cabico","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Friedman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"George A.","lastName":"Diamond","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Prognosis","type":1},{"tag":"Perfusion","type":1},{"tag":"Tomography","type":1}],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["bca41835-8ecb-386b-9f43-93f510e161cf"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["bca41835-8ecb-386b-9f43-93f510e161cf"]},"dateAdded":"2022-06-10T16:30:09Z","dateModified":"2022-06-14T16:53:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/RSQ2LG3Z","itemID":1961,"attachments":[{"key":"MDE8HL8C","version":428,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"RSQ2LG3Z","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["2ecc6840df284ff952ba137379ca0219fb36095b"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:49:48Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:49:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/MDE8HL8C","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/MDE8HL8C/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1962/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611683,"version":0},"$loki":80},{"itemID":1991,"item":{"key":"7KI4ZQYV","version":431,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Coronary Risk Estimation Based on Clinical Data in Electronic Health Records","abstractNote":"Background: Clinical features from electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to build a complementary tool to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) susceptibility. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an EHR score can improve CAD prediction and reclassification 1 year before diagnosis, beyond conventional clinical guidelines as determined by the pooled cohort equations (PCE) and a polygenic risk score for CAD. Methods: We applied a machine learning framework using clinical features from the EHR in a multiethnic, clinical care cohort (BioMe) comprising 555 CAD cases and 6,349 control subjects and in a population-based cohort (UK Biobank) comprising 3,130 CAD cases and 378,344 control subjects for external validation. Results: Compared with the PCE, the EHR score improved CAD prediction by 12% in the BioMe Biobank and by 9% in the UK Biobank. The EHR score reclassified 25.8% and 15.2% individuals in each cohort respectively, compared with the PCE score. We observed larger improvements in the EHR score over the PCE in a subgroup of individuals with low CAD risk, with 20% increased discrimination and 34.4% increased reclassification. In all models, the polygenic risk score for CAD did not improve CAD prediction, compared with the PCE or EHR score. Conclusions: The EHR score resulted in increased prediction and reclassification for CAD, demonstrating its potential use for population health monitoring of short-term CAD risk in large health systems.","date":"2022-03-29","url":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.01.021","accessDate":"2022-08-12","extra":"PMID: 35331410\nPublisher: American College of Cardiology Foundation Washington D.C.\nCitation Key: Petrazzini2022","volume":"79","pages":"1155-1166","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2022.01.021","issue":"12","ISSN":"15583597","creators":[{"firstName":"Ben O.","lastName":"Petrazzini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kumardeep","lastName":"Chaudhary","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carla","lastName":"Márquez-Luna","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iain S.","lastName":"Forrest","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ghislain","lastName":"Rocheleau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Judy","lastName":"Cho","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jagat","lastName":"Narula","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Girish","lastName":"Nadkarni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Do","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"coronary artery disease","type":1},{"tag":"biobank","type":1},{"tag":"electronic health record","type":1},{"tag":"polygenic risk score","type":1},{"tag":"pooled cohort equations","type":1},{"tag":"prevention","type":1}],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["d81d7061-96c1-37d5-ae7c-049671df4186"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["d81d7061-96c1-37d5-ae7c-049671df4186"]},"dateAdded":"2022-08-12T15:46:21Z","dateModified":"2022-08-12T17:22:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/7KI4ZQYV","itemID":1991,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611684,"version":0},"$loki":81},{"itemID":1992,"item":{"key":"W3EXLK34","version":431,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Utility of Nontraditional Risk Markers in Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment","abstractNote":"Background The improvement in discrimination gained by adding nontraditional cardiovascular risk markers cited in the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines to the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimator (pooled cohort equation [PCE]) is untested. Objectives This study assessed the predictive accuracy and improvement in reclassification gained by the addition of the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and family history (FH) of ASCVD to the PCE in participants of MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Methods The PCE was calibrated (cPCE) and used for this analysis. The Cox proportional hazards survival model, Harrell's C statistics, and net reclassification improvement analyses were used. ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease-related death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Results Of 6,814 MESA participants not prescribed statins at baseline, 5,185 had complete data and were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 61 years; 53.1% were women, 9.8% had diabetes, and 13.6% were current smokers. After 10 years of follow-up, 320 (6.2%) ASCVD events occurred. CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events in the multivariable Cox models. CAC score modestly improved the Harrell's C statistic (0.74 vs. 0.76; p = 0.04); ABI, hsCRP levels, and FH produced no improvement in Harrell's C statistic when added to the cPCE. Conclusions CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events.

Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms. OBJECTIVE To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease risk assessment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.","date":"2018-07-17","url":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2687225","accessDate":"2022-08-12","extra":"PMID: 29998297\nPublisher: American Medical Association\nCitation Key: Curry2018","volume":"320","pages":"272-280","publicationTitle":"JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2018.8359","issue":"3","ISSN":"15383598","creators":[{"firstName":"Susan J.","lastName":"Curry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alex H.","lastName":"Krist","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Douglas K.","lastName":"Owens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael J.","lastName":"Barry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aaron B.","lastName":"Caughey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karina W.","lastName":"Davidson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chyke A.","lastName":"Doubeni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John W.","lastName":"Epling","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alex R.","lastName":"Kemper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martha","lastName":"Kubik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C.

Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15 152 cases and 14 820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2·87 for current vs never, PAR 35·7% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3·25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49·2% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1·91, PAR 17·9%), diabetes (2·37, PAR 9·9%), abdominal obesity (1·12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1·62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20·1% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2·67, PAR 32·5%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0·70, PAR 13·7% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0·91, PAR 6·7%), and regular physical activity (0·86, PAR 12·2%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0·0001 for all risk factors and p=0·03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.","date":"2004-09-11","url":"http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673604170189/fulltext","accessDate":"2022-08-12","extra":"PMID: 15364185\nPublisher: Elsevier\nCitation Key: Yusuf2004","volume":"364","pages":"937-952","publicationTitle":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9","issue":"9438","ISSN":"01406736","creators":[{"firstName":"Prof Salim","lastName":"Yusuf","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Hawken","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Ôunpuu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Dans","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Avezum","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Lanas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"McQueen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Budaj","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Prem","lastName":"Pais","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Varigos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Lisheng","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["54333071-ae27-3f66-b5ce-aab3002240bd"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["54333071-ae27-3f66-b5ce-aab3002240bd"]},"dateAdded":"2022-08-12T15:52:34Z","dateModified":"2022-08-12T17:22:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/8QYVXUNH","itemID":1996,"attachments":[{"key":"DDJG5WC3","version":432,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673604170189/abstract","parentItem":"8QYVXUNH","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-12T15:52:34Z","dateModified":"2022-08-12T17:22:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/DDJG5WC3"},{"key":"U92PKMVV","version":431,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)17018-9/abstract","parentItem":"8QYVXUNH","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-12T15:52:34Z","dateModified":"2022-08-12T17:22:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/U92PKMVV"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611688,"version":0},"$loki":84},{"itemID":2019,"item":{"key":"QZHEZH9H","version":434,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Assessment of Nonfatal Myocardial Infarction as a Surrogate for All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality in Treatment or Prevention of Coronary Artery Disease: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials","abstractNote":"Importance: Although nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with an increased risk of mortality, evidence validating nonfatal MI as a surrogate end point for all-cause or cardiovascular (CV) mortality is lacking.

Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause or CV mortality and nonfatal MI. Results: A total of 144 articles randomizing 1211897 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Nonfatal MI did not meet the threshold for surrogacy for all-cause (R2= 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.08) or CV (R2= 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.27) mortality. Nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality in primary (R2= 0.01; 95% CI, 0.001-0.26), secondary (R2= 0.03; 95% CI, 0.00-0.20), mixed primary and secondary prevention (R2= 0.001; 95% CI, 0.00-0.08), or revascularization trials (R2= 0.21; 95% CI, 0.002-0.50). For trials enrolling patients before 2000 (R2= 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.36), between 2000 and 2009 (R2= 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.17), and from 2010 and after (R2= 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00-0.09), nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality. Nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality in randomized clinical trials with 2.0 to 3.9 (R2= 0.004; 95% CI, 0.00-0.08), 4.0 to 5.9 (R2= 0.06; 95% CI, 0.001-0.16), or 6.0 or more years of follow-up (R2= 0.30; 95% CI, 0.01-0.55). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this meta-analysis do not appear to establish nonfatal MI as a surrogate for all-cause or CV mortality in randomized clinical trials of interventions to treat or prevent coronary artery disease..","date":"2021-12-01","url":"https://jamanetwork-com.proxy.cc.uic.edu/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2785560","accessDate":"2022-09-27","extra":"PMID: 34694318\nPublisher: American Medical Association\nCitation Key: OFee2021","volume":"181","pages":"1575-1587","publicationTitle":"JAMA Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.5726","issue":"12","ISSN":"21686114","creators":[{"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"O'Fee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Deych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oriana","lastName":"Ciani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David L.","lastName":"Brown","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"myocardial infarction","type":1},{"tag":"follow-up","type":1},{"tag":"cardiovascular death","type":1},{"tag":"coronary arteriosclerosis","type":1},{"tag":"revascularization","type":1},{"tag":"surrogate endpoints","type":1}],"collections":["J8EASI8X"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["25916640-5e57-395d-93a8-589860f88f40"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["25916640-5e57-395d-93a8-589860f88f40"]},"dateAdded":"2022-09-27T18:42:32Z","dateModified":"2022-09-27T20:05:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/QZHEZH9H","itemID":2019,"attachments":[{"key":"72GHL9HA","version":571,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"QZHEZH9H","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["fa5de3e981086a94416e962e3846198c705dd0aa"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:50:26Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:50:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/72GHL9HA","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/72GHL9HA/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2020/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611689,"version":0},"$loki":85},{"itemID":2188,"item":{"key":"ITD7WIKI","version":450,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Short-term heart rate variability strongly predicts sudden cadiac death in chronic heart failure patients","abstractNote":"Background - The predictive value of heart rate variability (HRV) in chronic heart failure (CHF) has never been tested in a comprehensive multivariate model using short-term laboratory recordings designed to avoid the confounding effects of respiration and behavioral factors. Methods and Results - A multivariate survival model for the identification of sudden (presumably arrhythmic) death was developed with data from 202 consecutive patients referred between 1991 and 1995 with moderate to severe CHF (age 52±9 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 24±7%, New York Heart Association class 2.3±0.7; the derivation sample). Time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters obtained from an 8′ recording of ECG at baseline and during controlled breathing (12 to 15 breaths/min) were challenged against clinical and functional parameters. This model was then validated in 242 consecutive patients referred between 1996 and 2001 (validation sample). In the derivation sample, sudden death was independently predicted by a model that included low-frequency power (LFP) of HRV during controlled breathing ≤13 ms2 and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ≥77 mm (relative risk [RR] 3.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 9.3, and RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.3, respectively). The derivation model was also a significant predictor in the validation sample (P=0.04). In the validation sample, LFP ≤11 ms2 during controlled breathing and ≥83 ventricular premature contractions per hour on Holter monitoring were both independent predictors of sudden death (RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 7.6, and RR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 9.0, respectively). Conclusions - Reduced short-term LFP during controlled breathing is a powerful predictor of sudden death in patients with CHF that is independent of many other variables. These results refine the identification of patients who may benefit from prophylactic implantation of a cardiac defibrillator.","date":"2003-02-04","extra":"PMID: 12566367\nCitation Key: LaRovere2003","volume":"107","pages":"565-570","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.0000047275.25795.17","issue":"4","ISSN":"00097322","creators":[{"firstName":"Maria Teresa","lastName":"La Rovere","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gian Domenico","lastName":"Pinna","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Maestri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Mortara","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Soccorso","lastName":"Capomolla","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oreste","lastName":"Febo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Ferrari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mariella","lastName":"Franchini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Gnemmi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Opasich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pier Giorgio","lastName":"Riccardi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Egidio","lastName":"Traversi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Cobelli","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Prognosis","type":1},{"tag":"Respiration","type":1},{"tag":"Heart failure","type":1},{"tag":"Nervous system, autonomic","type":1},{"tag":"Death, sudden","type":1}],"collections":["RRVP5M4C"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["ba2992c5-d466-36ae-9911-0b2f37b44a29"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["ba2992c5-d466-36ae-9911-0b2f37b44a29"]},"dateAdded":"2023-04-13T17:57:30Z","dateModified":"2023-04-13T20:15:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ITD7WIKI","itemID":2188,"attachments":[{"key":"IWLKD64T","version":450,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"ITD7WIKI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"01.CIR.0000047275.25795.17.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["470b236ad54d5da9984b36f147a133eb3e66784c"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:52:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:52:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/IWLKD64T","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/IWLKD64T/01.CIR.0000047275.25795.17.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2189/01.CIR.0000047275.25795.17.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611692,"version":0},"$loki":86},{"itemID":2190,"item":{"key":"C2FRKGPA","version":451,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Stress and heart rate variability: A meta-analysis and review of the literature","abstractNote":"Objective Physical or mental imbalance caused by harmful stimuli can induce stress to maintain homeostasis. During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Methods Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal. Conclusion In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the ob-jective assessment of psychological health and stress.","date":"2018-03-01","extra":"Publisher: Korean Neuropsychiatric Association\nCitation Key: Kim2018","volume":"15","pages":"235-245","publicationTitle":"Psychiatry Investigation","DOI":"10.30773/pi.2017.08.17","issue":"3","ISSN":"19763026","creators":[{"firstName":"Hye Geum","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eun Jin","lastName":"Cheon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dai Seg","lastName":"Bai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Young Hwan","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bon Hoon","lastName":"Koo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Autonomic nervous system","type":1},{"tag":"Heart rate variability","type":1},{"tag":"Stress","type":1}],"collections":["RRVP5M4C"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["ecc86179-d755-3864-aca0-737d4bf487ce"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["ecc86179-d755-3864-aca0-737d4bf487ce"]},"dateAdded":"2023-04-13T17:57:31Z","dateModified":"2023-04-13T20:15:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/C2FRKGPA","itemID":2190,"attachments":[{"key":"SCIC8V44","version":451,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"C2FRKGPA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"kim-2017_stress-hrv-meta-analysis.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["837d0dbaef4ae006d13856e8847755cc0bbb8321"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:52:01Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:52:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/SCIC8V44","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/SCIC8V44/kim-2017_stress-hrv-meta-analysis.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2191/kim-2017_stress-hrv-meta-analysis.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611692,"version":0},"$loki":87},{"itemID":2192,"item":{"key":"MYCJG9EH","version":451,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heart rate variability in the prediction of mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis of healthy and patient populations","abstractNote":"Measures of heart rate variability (HRV) as a predictor of risk of disease and mortality have been investigated from various perspectives for more than six decades.

We examined the association between HRV and incident CHD and non-CHD mortality in a cohort of 11,654 men and women aged 45–64 years at intake, from the biracial, population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Supine, resting, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected at the baseline examination. High frequency (HF; 0.15–0.40 Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) spectral powers, LF/HF ratio, normalized HF and LF, the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN), and the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (MSSD) were used as the conventional indexes of HRV to measure cardiac autonomic control. From this cohort, 635 cases of incident CHD (including 346 cases of incident myocardial infarction [MI] and 82 cases of fatal CHD), and 623 non-CHD deaths were identified and validated after an average of 8 years of follow-up. Among individuals with diabetes, the multivariable adjusted proportional hazards ratios (95% CI) were 2.03 (1.28–3.23), 1.60 (1.12–2.27), 1.50 (0.65–3.42), and 1.27 (0.84–1.91) for incident MI, incident CHD, fatal CHD, and non-CHD deaths, respectively, comparing the lowest quartile to the upper most three quartiles of HF. A similar pattern of associations was found for LF, SDNN, and MSSD. By contrast, there was no consistent pattern of associations among individuals without diabetes. At the population level, a lower HRV (reflective of impaired cardiac autonomic control) is statistically significantly related to the development of CHD among individuals with diabetes, independent of markers of the duration/severity of the glucose metabolism impairment. These data suggest a contribution of an impaired cardiac autonomic control to the risk of CHD among individuals with diabetes.</p>","date":"2002-12-01","extra":"Citation Key: Liao2002","volume":"51","pages":"3524-3531","publicationTitle":"Diabetes","DOI":"10.2337/diabetes.51.12.3524","issue":"12","ISSN":"0012-1797","creators":[{"firstName":"Duanping","lastName":"Liao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mercedes","lastName":"Carnethon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gregory W.","lastName":"Evans","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wayne E.","lastName":"Cascio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Heiss","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RRVP5M4C"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["d8a5ff9c-067c-3f7e-b61c-c01fc61b4385"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["d8a5ff9c-067c-3f7e-b61c-c01fc61b4385"]},"dateAdded":"2023-04-13T20:17:12Z","dateModified":"2023-04-13T20:19:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/5Y2CXUBU","itemID":2194,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611695,"version":0},"$loki":89},{"itemID":2195,"item":{"key":"SAB5Y7TF","version":451,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heart Rate Variability from Short Electrocardiographic Recordings Predicts Mortality from All Causes in Middle-aged and Elderly Men: The Zutphen Study","date":"1997-05-15","extra":"Citation Key: Dekker1997","volume":"145","pages":"899-908","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009049","issue":"10","ISSN":"0002-9262","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients. © 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","date":"2002-09-01","url":"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L35266733%5Cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01394-X%5Cnhttp://sfx.library.uu.nl/utrecht?sid=EMBASE&issn=00063223&id=doi:10.1016%2FS0006-3223%2802%2901394-X&atitle=Major+depr","extra":"PMID: 12242058\nCitation Key: Yeragani2002","volume":"52","pages":"418-29","publicationTitle":"Biological psychiatry","issue":"5","ISSN":"0006-3223","creators":[{"firstName":"Vikram K","lastName":"Yeragani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vanessa","lastName":"Pesce","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anusha","lastName":"Jayaraman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Roose","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yeragani","lastName":"V.K.","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pesce","lastName":"V.","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jayaraman","lastName":"A.","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roose","lastName":"S.","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"electrocardiogram","type":1},{"tag":"heart rate variability","type":1},{"tag":"spectral analysis","type":1},{"tag":"adult","type":1},{"tag":"aged","type":1},{"tag":"article","type":1},{"tag":"awake","type":1},{"tag":"cardiovascular mortality","type":1},{"tag":"clinical trial","type":1},{"tag":"controlled clinical trial","type":1},{"tag":"controlled study","type":1},{"tag":"depression","type":1},{"tag":"disease association","type":1},{"tag":"double blind procedure","type":1},{"tag":"drug blood level","type":1},{"tag":"drug effect","type":1},{"tag":"fractal analysis","type":1},{"tag":"heart protection","type":1},{"tag":"hemodynamic monitoring","type":1},{"tag":"human","type":1},{"tag":"ischemic heart disease","type":1},{"tag":"major clinical study","type":1},{"tag":"Major depression","type":1},{"tag":"nonlinear","type":1},{"tag":"nortriptyline","type":1},{"tag":"paroxetine","type":1},{"tag":"priority journal","type":1},{"tag":"sleep","type":1},{"tag":"sleep waking cycle","type":1},{"tag":"symbolic dynamics","type":1},{"tag":"treatment outcome","type":1},{"tag":"vagus tone","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["98f8382d-5c32-427b-8105-79d7f83061c8"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["74f5225c-4ba8-328b-8eb3-1b56a5d5614b"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:52Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/LVE57ZYK","itemID":718,"attachments":[{"key":"NDJYIKM8","version":304,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"LVE57ZYK","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2002 - Vikram - Major depression with ischemic heart disease Effects of paroxetine .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["54e9e7775a429563d87a10ad92bc5cf26bd9f131"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:40:52Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:40:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/NDJYIKM8","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/NDJYIKM8/2002 - Vikram - Major depression with ischemic heart disease Effects of paroxetine .pdf","defaultPath":"files/719/2002 - Vikram - Major depression with ischemic heart disease Effects of paroxetine .pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611698,"version":0},"$loki":92},{"itemID":722,"item":{"key":"AJ9KQFXQ","version":304,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of Depressive Symptoms and Heart Rate Variability in Vietnam War–Era Twins","abstractNote":"Importance Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear. Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized β coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models (β coefficients ranging from −0.14 to −0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with β coefficients ranging from 0.05 to −0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.","date":"2018-07-01","url":"http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0747","accessDate":"2018-05-28","extra":"Citation Key: Huang2018","volume":"75","pages":"705","publicationTitle":"JAMA Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0747","issue":"7","ISSN":"2168-622X","creators":[{"firstName":"Minxuan","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shaoyong","lastName":"Su","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel J.","lastName":"Lampert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleksiy M.","lastName":"Levantsevych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lucy","lastName":"Shallenberger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Autonomic changes are often found in altered mood states and appear to be a central biological substrate linking depression to a number of physical dysfunctions. Alterations of autonomic nervous system functioning that promotes vagal withdrawal are reflected in reductions of heart rate variability (HRV) indexes. Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity. Altogether, these pieces of evidence support the idea that HRV might represent a useful endophenotype for psychological/physical comorbidities, and its routine application should be advised to assess the efficacy of prevention/intervention therapies in a number of psychosomatic and psychiatric dysfunctions. Further research, also making use of appropriate animal models, could provide a significant support to this point of view and possibly help to identify appropriate antidepressant therapies that do not interefere with physical health.","date":"2015-05-04","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26004818","accessDate":"2018-10-29","extra":"PMID: 26004818\nCitation Key: Sgoifo2015\nISBN: 1607-8888 (Electronic)\\r1025-3890 (Linking)","volume":"18","pages":"343-352","publicationTitle":"Stress","DOI":"10.3109/10253890.2015.1045868","issue":"3","ISSN":"16078888","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Sgoifo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Carnevali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria de los Angeles","lastName":"Pico Alfonso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Amore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"heart rate variability","type":1},{"tag":"depression","type":1},{"tag":"Animal models","type":1},{"tag":"autonomic function","type":1},{"tag":"cardiovascular disease","type":1},{"tag":"emotion","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["3e1bdb93-9de2-4b17-84f6-bc327945a026"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["61f49793-a60f-3986-899e-81d6e88cd46a"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:52Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/UJRX66TX","itemID":724,"attachments":[{"key":"LBVANQG3","version":304,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10253890.2015.1045868","parentItem":"UJRX66TX","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:52Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/LBVANQG3"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611701,"version":0},"$loki":94},{"itemID":726,"item":{"key":"CWAAIH4P","version":305,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Depressive symptoms and heart rate variability: Evidence for a shared genetic substrate in a study of twins","abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins.

Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.\\n\\nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV.

Design A population-based, health and nutrition prospective survey. Methods In the context of the ATTICA Study (2002-2012), 853 adult participants without previous CVD history (453 men (45+/-13 years) and 400 women (44+/-18 years)) underwent psychological evaluations through validated, self-reporting depression and anxiety questionnaires. Results After adjustment for multiple established CVD risk factors, both reported depression and anxiety levels were positively and independently associated with the 10-year CVD incidence, with depression markedly increasing the CVD risk by approximately fourfold (adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.6 (1.3, 11) for depression status; 1.03 (1.0, 1.1) for anxiety levels).

METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression.

Results from longitudinal cohort studies converge in illustrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) subsequently increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with about 80%. The impact of MDD on cardiovascular health may be partly explained by mediating mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, therapy non-compliance) and unfavorable pathophysiological disturbances (autonomic, HPA-axis, metabolic and immuno-inflammatory dysregulations). A summary of the literature findings as well as relevant results from the large-scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2981) are presented. Persons with MDD have significantly worse lifestyles as well as more pathophysiological disturbances as compared to healthy controls. Some of these differences seem to be specific for (typical versus ‘atypical’, or antidepressant treated versus drug-naive) subgroups of MDD patients. Alternative explanations are also present, namely undetected confounding, iatrogenic effects or ‘third factors’ such as genetics.","date":"2017","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.003","accessDate":"2019-02-24","extra":"Citation Key: Penninx2017","volume":"74","pages":"277-286","publicationTitle":"Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.003","ISSN":"18737528","creators":[{"firstName":"Brenda W.J.H.","lastName":"Penninx","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Epidemiology","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Cardiac autonomic control","type":1},{"tag":"Cardiovascular","type":1},{"tag":"Cortisol","type":1},{"tag":"Inflammation","type":1},{"tag":"Lifestyle","type":1},{"tag":"Metabolic syndrome","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["7cc341e0-9b7f-424c-9990-2eeadf216aff"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["bbdeef82-be8b-349e-a2b4-d97a2e59bd59"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:52Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/THD5SVTC","itemID":733,"attachments":[{"key":"XJFS27EL","version":305,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"THD5SVTC","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017 - Penninx - Depression and cardiovascular disease Epidemiological evidence on their linking mechanisms.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["bb99dee5d7ccde8a2b45d50006ca7fe878ef05a8"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:40:58Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:40:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/XJFS27EL","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/XJFS27EL/2017 - Penninx - Depression and cardiovascular disease Epidemiological evidence on their linking mechanisms.pdf","defaultPath":"files/734/2017 - Penninx - Depression and cardiovascular disease Epidemiological evidence on their linking mechanisms.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611707,"version":0},"$loki":98},{"itemID":735,"item":{"key":"VSBIMWYR","version":305,"itemType":"report","title":"Heart Rate Variability in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients With Major Depression","abstractNote":"Context: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.","date":"2007","url":"http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.9.1025","extra":"PMID: 17768267\nPublication Title: Archives of General Psychiatry\nVolume: 64\nDOI: 10.1001/archpsyc.64.9.1025\nCitation Key: Glassmana\nIssue: 9\nISBN: 0003-990X\nISSN: 0003-990X","pages":"1025","creators":[{"firstName":"Alexander H.","lastName":"Glassman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95% CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95%CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95% CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression. Further, we found a higher risk of CVD among depressed individuals with symptoms of anxious distress.","date":"2015-10-15","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26469703","accessDate":"2018-12-25","extra":"PMID: 26469703\nCitation Key: Almas2015\nISBN: 1932-6203","volume":"10","pages":"e0140742","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0140742","issue":"10","ISSN":"19326203","creators":[{"firstName":"Aysha","lastName":"Almas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yvonne","lastName":"Forsell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Romaina","lastName":"Iqbal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Imre","lastName":"Janszky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jette","lastName":"Moller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Hashimoto","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["c0e38c07-d0fd-4ded-9606-3081fed8a21e"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["7b2480ca-f65b-3822-a942-8fd8624d56d0"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:52Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/93KCWJDG","itemID":739,"attachments":[{"key":"FFJDKZWG","version":306,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4607409","parentItem":"93KCWJDG","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:52Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/FFJDKZWG"},{"key":"CZCCV2F3","version":306,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140742","parentItem":"93KCWJDG","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:52Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/CZCCV2F3"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611712,"version":0},"$loki":101},{"itemID":742,"item":{"key":"5HIYXBXK","version":306,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of depression with reduced heart rate variability in coronary artery disease","abstractNote":"Decreased heart rate (HR) variability is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiac populations.

Nineteen patients with angiographically documented CAD and either major or minor depression were compared with a sample of nondepressed CAD patients according to age, sex, and smoking status. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals was used as the primary index of HR variability.

These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. RESULTS: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P<.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1%) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P<.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.31; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.","date":"2005","extra":"PMID: 16009863\nPublication Title: Archives of Internal Medicine\nVolume: 165\nDOI: 10.1001/archinte.165.13.1486\nCitation Key: Carney\nIssue: 13\nISBN: 0003-9926 (Print)\\r0003-9926\nISSN: 00039926","pages":"1486-1491","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James A.","lastName":"Blumenthal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Phyllis K.","lastName":"Stein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"William B.","lastName":"Howells","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lisa F.","lastName":"Berkman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lana L.","lastName":"Watkins","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan M.","lastName":"Czajkowski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Junichiro","lastName":"Hayano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter P.","lastName":"Domitrovich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Allan S.","lastName":"Jaffe","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Male","type":1},{"tag":"Electrocardiography","type":1},{"tag":"epidemiology","type":1},{"tag":"mortality","type":1},{"tag":"heart rate variability","type":1},{"tag":"Heart Rate","type":1},{"tag":"adult","type":1},{"tag":"aged","type":1},{"tag":"article","type":1},{"tag":"clinical trial","type":1},{"tag":"controlled clinical trial","type":1},{"tag":"controlled study","type":1},{"tag":"depression","type":1},{"tag":"human","type":1},{"tag":"ischemic heart disease","type":1},{"tag":"major clinical study","type":1},{"tag":"priority journal","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Ambulatory","type":1},{"tag":"Circadian Rhythm","type":1},{"tag":"comparative study","type":1},{"tag":"complications","type":1},{"tag":"confidence interval","type":1},{"tag":"death","type":1},{"tag":"electrocardiography","type":1},{"tag":"female","type":1},{"tag":"Female","type":1},{"tag":"follow up","type":1},{"tag":"Follow-Up Studies","type":1},{"tag":"hazard assessment","type":1},{"tag":"heart infarction","type":1},{"tag":"male","type":1},{"tag":"Middle Aged","type":1},{"tag":"Myocardial Infarction","type":1},{"tag":"physiology","type":1},{"tag":"physiopathology","type":1},{"tag":"Proportional Hazards Models","type":1},{"tag":"Retrospective Studies","type":1},{"tag":"risk assessment","type":1},{"tag":"risk factor","type":1},{"tag":"Risk Factors","type":1},{"tag":"Severity of Illness Index","type":1},{"tag":"survival","type":1},{"tag":"Survival Rate","type":1},{"tag":"United States","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["ca1bfee8-d125-44dc-8c38-c595b758aadc"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["5e688641-cb08-36ab-a319-1152e8da50d6"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/CIZN5GHC","itemID":752,"attachments":[{"key":"IH9IZVAE","version":307,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","url":"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L41058028%5Cnhttp://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/165/13/1486.pdf%5Cnhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.13.1486%5Cnhttp://sfx.library.uu.nl/utrecht?sid=EMBASE&issn=00039926&i","parentItem":"CIZN5GHC","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/IH9IZVAE"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611720,"version":0},"$loki":107},{"itemID":754,"item":{"key":"672RAIFR","version":307,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Exploring the path between depression, anxiety and 10-year cardiovascular disease incidence, among apparently healthy Greek middle-aged adults: The ATTICA study","abstractNote":"Objectives Although there is substantial evidence that psychological factors play an important role in the onset and course of cardiovascular disease (CVD), less is known about their combined effect and the pathways by which they affect cardiovascular health. The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002–2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 ± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as “Psychological distress”; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results “Psychological distress” was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, “Psychological distress” mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: −7.1, 95% CI: −9.7, −4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.","date":"2017-12","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29150168","accessDate":"2018-12-25","extra":"PMID: 29150168\nCitation Key: Kollia2017\nISBN: 2047-4873","volume":"106","pages":"73-79","publicationTitle":"Maturitas","DOI":"10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.09.005","ISSN":"18734111","creators":[{"firstName":"Natasa","lastName":"Kollia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Demosthenes","lastName":"Panagiotakos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ekavi","lastName":"Georgousopoulou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Chrysohoou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Yannakoulia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christodoulos","lastName":"Stefanadis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Somnath","lastName":"Chatterji","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Josep Maria","lastName":"Haro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Charalabos","lastName":"Papageorgiou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Pitsavos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cardiovascular disease","type":1},{"tag":"CVD risk factors","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Anxiety","type":1},{"tag":"Mediation","type":1},{"tag":"Psychological distress","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["7eef366a-c8df-4441-a89b-0720449d8e12"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["e86f873d-3c83-351c-80d1-4c6164afcc71"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/672RAIFR","itemID":754,"attachments":[{"key":"WURCHI2C","version":307,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378512217307442","parentItem":"672RAIFR","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WURCHI2C"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611721,"version":0},"$loki":108},{"itemID":756,"item":{"key":"W87H7X3Q","version":308,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Depressive symptoms predict heart rate recovery after exercise treadmill testing in patients with coronary artery disease: Results from the psychophysiological investigations of myocardial ischemia study","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with low heart rate variability (HRV) and prolonged HR recovery after exercise testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50% blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5% of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p < .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.","date":"2008","extra":"PMID: 18434491\nCitation Key: Hughes2008\nISBN: 0033-3174","volume":"70","pages":"456-460","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e31816fcab3","issue":"4","ISSN":"15347796","creators":[{"firstName":"Joel W.","lastName":"Hughes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kaki M.","lastName":"York","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David S.","lastName":"Sheps","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Autonomic nervous system","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Coronary disease","type":1},{"tag":"Heart rate recovery","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["d64f72fa-f5c4-4f80-a986-dfe04419fb7c"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["5dc06e50-5d7b-331b-8ee9-f19b9392ae42"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/W87H7X3Q","itemID":756,"attachments":[{"key":"WY7AT5K3","version":308,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"W87H7X3Q","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2008 - Hughes et al. - Depressive symptoms predict heart rate recovery after exercise treadmill testing in patients with coronary artery.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["767d69609446959e2a98896f16613f4f7d087a39"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:41:06Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:41:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WY7AT5K3","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WY7AT5K3/2008 - Hughes et al. - Depressive symptoms predict heart rate recovery after exercise treadmill testing in patients with coronary artery.pdf","defaultPath":"files/757/2008 - Hughes et al. - Depressive symptoms predict heart rate recovery after exercise treadmill testing in patients with coronary artery.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611722,"version":0},"$loki":109},{"itemID":758,"item":{"key":"P378XQ2H","version":308,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Clinical and non-clinical depression and anxiety in young people: A scoping review on heart rate variability","abstractNote":"Background Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of cardiac autonomic nervous system functioning, has emerged as a physiological indicator for emotional regulation and psychological well-being. HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10–24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).","date":"2017-12","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870754","accessDate":"2018-10-29","extra":"PMID: 28870754\nCitation Key: Paniccia2017\nISBN: 1872-7484 (Electronic) 1566-0702 (Linking)","volume":"208","pages":"1-14","publicationTitle":"Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical","DOI":"10.1016/j.autneu.2017.08.008","ISSN":"18727484","creators":[{"firstName":"Melissa","lastName":"Paniccia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Paniccia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Thomas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Taha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Reed","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Autonomic nervous system","type":1},{"tag":"Heart rate variability","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Anxiety","type":1},{"tag":"Young people","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["8d7f3470-d466-429c-a8dd-e1ef0f1676c1"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["7dc3f7a4-5ac9-3b04-b057-ef85515994fc"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/P378XQ2H","itemID":758,"attachments":[{"key":"FXNILHCE","version":308,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1566070216302181","parentItem":"P378XQ2H","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/FXNILHCE"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611723,"version":0},"$loki":110},{"itemID":760,"item":{"key":"WA2YNCZH","version":308,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Heart and soul: Heart rate variability and major depression","abstractNote":"There is a bidirectional relationship between affective disorders and cardiovascular abnormalities, often described as a downward spiral, whereas major depressive disorders (MDD, and anxiety disorders) significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD); CVD are also associated with increased risk of developing MDD (and anxiety disorders). Moreover, the prognosis and progression of CVD is significantly worsened in the presence of MDD. Heart rate variability (HRV) has often been suggested as a potential mediator in this comorbidity. In this review, we discuss HRV alterations in MDD. However, we mainly focus on the direct relationship between HRV alterations and psychiatric symptoms, rather than its relationship with CVD, as this has been reviewed elsewhere. After a general introduction to HRV and how it can be measured, we review how HRV is altered in MDD. We subsequently describe how antidepressant drugs affect HRV, showing that some classes (such as tricyclics) generally worsen HRV, whereas others (most notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have a more positive influence. We also review the effects of several other treatments, with a special focus on vagal nerve stimulation, finishing with some further considerations and recommendation for further research, both in humans and animals., Copyright (C) 2018 YEAR Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

High QT interval variability is a risk factor for arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression is associated with increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. METHODS: Twenty patients with major depression recovering from a recent myocardial infarction were matched with 20 nondepressed post-myocardial infarction patients on age and sex, and all underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on average heart rate, heart rate variability, or other electrocardiographic measures. However, the QT interval showed significantly greater variability in the depressed than in the nondepressed group, especially at midnight and at 6:00 AM. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed post-myocardial infarction patients may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. More work is needed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of QT variability in these patients.","date":"2003","extra":"PMID: 12651984\nCitation Key: Carney2003\nISBN: 1534-7796 (Electronic)","volume":"65","pages":"177-180","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/01.PSY.0000033129.21715.4B","issue":"2","ISSN":"00333174","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Phyllis K.","lastName":"Stein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lana L.","lastName":"Watkins","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Diane","lastName":"Catellier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Allan S.","lastName":"Jaffe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vikram K.","lastName":"Yeragani","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"QT interval","type":1},{"tag":"Myocardial infarction","type":1},{"tag":"Psychiatric depression","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["b5a789c4-29ff-41b7-9990-0950c635fd3d"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["9063ee12-df20-3ce9-a7a2-ed696649cc9d"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/LTIBYZCJ","itemID":765,"attachments":[{"key":"MXVV9Y62","version":309,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"LTIBYZCJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2003 - Carney et al. - Effects of depression on QT interval variability after myocardial infarction.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["494231adda26395d70f2052f585cb43080efdc87"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:41:10Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:41:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/MXVV9Y62","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/MXVV9Y62/2003 - Carney et al. - Effects of depression on QT interval variability after myocardial infarction.pdf","defaultPath":"files/766/2003 - Carney et al. - Effects of depression on QT interval variability after myocardial infarction.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611724,"version":0},"$loki":112},{"itemID":767,"item":{"key":"BT2E84FX","version":309,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sertraline treatment of major depression in patients with acute MI or unstable angina","abstractNote":"CONTEXT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in 15% to 23% of patients with acute coronary syndromes and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. However, no published evidence exists that antidepressant drugs are safe or efficacious in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001. PATIENTS: A total of 369 patients with MDD (64% male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74%; unstable angina, 26%). INTERVENTION: After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD. RESULTS: Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54% [10%]; week 16, 54% [11%]; placebo: baseline, 52% [13%]; week 16, 53% [13%]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) runs (sertraline: 13.1%; placebo: 12.9%), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at end point (sertraline: 12%; placebo: 13%), or other cardiac measures. All comparisons were statistically nonsignificant (P> or = .05). The incidence of severe cardiovascular adverse events was 14.5% with sertraline and 22.4% with placebo. In the total randomized sample, the CGI-I (P =.049), but not the HAM-D (P =.14), favored sertraline.

The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions.

Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

There are few data concerning depression as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12%. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.0).

The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95% CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95% CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.","date":"2007","extra":"PMID: 17167127\nCitation Key: Carney2007a\nISBN: 0033-3174","volume":"69","pages":"4-9","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/01.psy.0000249733.33811.00","issue":"1","ISSN":"00333174","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"William B.","lastName":"Howells","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James A.","lastName":"Blumenthal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Phyllis K.","lastName":"Stein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lisa F.","lastName":"Berkman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lana L.","lastName":"Watkins","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan M.","lastName":"Czajkowski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Steinmeyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Junichiro","lastName":"Hayano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter P.","lastName":"Domitrovich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew M.","lastName":"Burg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Allan S.","lastName":"Jaffe","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Acute myocardial infarction","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Heart rate turbulence","type":1},{"tag":"Survival","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["93753746-50be-41fd-be29-1544dba6a66d"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["62723f2d-ddbb-3738-b56c-bbefdfb2eb7d"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:54Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WVDF8CE6","itemID":784,"attachments":[{"key":"VQ6CU4VC","version":310,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"WVDF8CE6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2007 - Carney et al. - Heart rate turbulence, depression, and survival after acute myocardial infarction.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["5533b1a6a603846269a77960b2a9528a2cf2600a"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:41:20Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:41:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/VQ6CU4VC","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VQ6CU4VC/2007 - Carney et al. - Heart rate turbulence, depression, and survival after acute myocardial infarction.pdf","defaultPath":"files/785/2007 - Carney et al. - Heart rate turbulence, depression, and survival after acute myocardial infarction.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611729,"version":0},"$loki":117},{"itemID":786,"item":{"key":"62PMADWW","version":311,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sex and age differences in the association of depression with obstructive coronary artery disease and adverse cardiovascular events","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Young women with coronary heart disease have high rates of depression and a higher risk of adverse events than men of similar age. Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged ≤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years or women aged >55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged ≤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years and women aged >55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected or established CAD, depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of death, particularly in young women. This group may be especially vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of depression.","date":"2014-06-18","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24943475","accessDate":"2018-03-17","extra":"PMID: 24943475\nPublisher: American Heart Association, Inc.\nCitation Key: Shah2014\nISBN: 2047-9980","volume":"3","pages":"e000741","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.113.000741","issue":"3","ISSN":"20479980","creators":[{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Ghasemzadeh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elisa","lastName":"Zaragoza-Macias","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Riyaz","lastName":"Patel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Danny J.","lastName":"Eapen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ian J.","lastName":"Neeland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik M.","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.

Recently, large prospective epidemiologic studies and smaller basic science studies have firmly established a connection between CVD and several psychological conditions, including depression, chronic psychological stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. In addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article, we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD, focusing on findings from the last 5 years. For each mental health condition, we first examine the epidemiologic evidence establishing a link with CVD.

This study examined the relationship between depressive and anxiety disorder and use of antidepressants with T-wave amplitude (TWA) and QT-interval. Methods: Data was obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n = 1,383). Depression/anxiety was diagnosed with the DSM-IV based Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established. T-wave amplitude and QT-interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were obtained from an ECG measured in a type II axis configuration. Results: Compared to controls, persons with depression or anxiety disorders did not show a significantly different TWA (p = 0.58; Cohen's d = 0.046) or QTc (p = 0.48; Cohen's d = -0.057). In spite of known sympathomimetic effects, TCA use (p = 0.26; Cohen's d = -0.162) and SNRI use (p = 0.70; Cohen's d = -0.055) were not significantly associated with a lower TWA. TCA use (p = 0.12; Cohen's d = 0.225) and SNRI use (p = 0.11; Cohen's d = 0.227) were also not significantly associated with a prolonged QTc. Conclusion: We did not find evidence that either depressive/anxiety disorder or antidepressant use is associated with abnormalities in TWA or QTc. Earlier found sympathomimetic effects of TCAs and SNRIs are not evident in these measures of cardiac repolarization.","date":"2018","url":"www.frontiersin.org","accessDate":"2018-10-24","extra":"PMID: 29922124\nCitation Key: Hu2018","volume":"12","pages":"375","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2018.00375","issue":"JUN","ISSN":"1662453X","creators":[{"firstName":"Mandy X","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Femke","lastName":"Lamers","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brenda W.J.H.","lastName":"Penninx","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eco J.C.","lastName":"de Geus","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Autonomic nervous system","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Anxiety","type":1},{"tag":"Antidepressant","type":1},{"tag":"Cardiac repolarization","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["f7183d9a-e525-487a-896a-18cd755a9086"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["0ba84b5c-5ae2-379c-bb7c-a705559f9bcf"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:55Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/C3JST5IC","itemID":830,"attachments":[{"key":"QJSMIDZR","version":315,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"C3JST5IC","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2018 - Hu et al. - Association between depression, anxiety, and antidepressant use with T-Wave amplitude and QT-interval.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["de35956e1b4d41c4233a9a9aa743a28b48f9afef"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:41:37Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:41:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/QJSMIDZR","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/QJSMIDZR/2018 - Hu et al. - Association between depression, anxiety, and antidepressant use with T-Wave amplitude and QT-interval.pdf","defaultPath":"files/831/2018 - Hu et al. - Association between depression, anxiety, and antidepressant use with T-Wave amplitude and QT-interval.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611733,"version":0},"$loki":121},{"itemID":832,"item":{"key":"IAL3ERHE","version":315,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effect of Escitalopram vs Placebo Treatment for Depression on Long-term Cardiac Outcomes in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome","abstractNote":"Importance Depression has been associated with poorer medical outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but there are few data on the effects of antidepressant treatment on long-term prognosis. Objective To investigate the effect on long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of escitalopram treatment of depression in patients with recent ACS. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 300 patients with recent ACS and depression enrolled from May 2007 to March 2013, with follow-up completed in June 2017, at Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram in flexible dosages of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d (n = 149) or matched placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Four secondary outcomes were the individual MACE components of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and PCI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3%]), 100% completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9%) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.96;P = .03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8% vs 24.5% (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.51-1.33;P = .43), for cardiac death, 10.7% vs 13.2% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.41-1.52;P = .48); for MI, 8.7% vs 15.2% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-0.96;P = .04), and for PCI, 12.8% vs 19.9% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.33-1.04;P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.

Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) may explain why depressed patients are at increased risk. Studies of medically well, depressed psychiatric patients have found elevated levels of plasma catecholamines and other markers of altered ANS function compared with controls. Studies of depressed patients with CHD have also uncovered evidence of ANS dysfunction, including elevated heart rate, low heart rate variability, exaggerated heart rate responses to physical stressors, high variability in ventricular repolarization, and low baroreceptor sensitivity. All of these indicators of ANS dysfunction have been associated with increased risks of mortality and cardiac morbidity in patients with CHD. Further research is needed to determine whether ANS dysfunction mediates the effects of depression on the course and outcome of CHD, and to develop clinical interventions that improve cardiovascular autonomic regulation while relieving depression in patients with CHD.","date":"2005-05","url":"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-200505001-00008","accessDate":"2018-05-19","extra":"PMID: 15953797\nCitation Key: Carney2005\nISBN: 1534-7796 (Electronic)\\r1534-7796 (Linking)","volume":"67","pages":"S29-S33","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/01.psy.0000162254.61556.d5","issue":"SUPPL. 1","ISSN":"00333174","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard C.","lastName":"Veith","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mortality","type":1},{"tag":"Myocardial infarction","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomic nervous system","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Coronary disease","type":1},{"tag":"Depressive disorder","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["270731d4-6af5-421c-b6b3-7a669671ede2"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["ea45ae18-a0c7-3238-b655-89c864709e30"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:55Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/VFJRED8W","itemID":838,"attachments":[{"key":"I6Q3BP9Z","version":316,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"VFJRED8W","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2005 - Carney, Freedland, Veith - Depression, the autonomic nervous system, and coronary heart disease.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["4ab6e7b3a650c849a4ee9aa6c82b8886e161cb82"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:41:42Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:41:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/I6Q3BP9Z","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/I6Q3BP9Z/2005 - Carney, Freedland, Veith - Depression, the autonomic nervous system, and coronary heart disease.pdf","defaultPath":"files/839/2005 - Carney, Freedland, Veith - Depression, the autonomic nervous system, and coronary heart disease.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611734,"version":0},"$loki":123},{"itemID":842,"item":{"key":"7W4GG9QU","version":316,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory: Twenty-five years of evaluation","abstractNote":"Research studies focusing on the psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with psychiatric and nonpsychiatric samples were reviewed for the years 1961 through June, 1986.

Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-α was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14% lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006). The CFR in the dizygotic twins with MDD was also lower than in the control twins. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for a shared genetic pathway between MDD and microvascular dysfunction.

Patients discontinued β-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as \"0\" (not at all) to \"3\" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.","date":"2001-09","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11556941","accessDate":"2019-03-03","extra":"PMID: 11556941\nCitation Key: Kroenke2001","volume":"16","pages":"606-13","publicationTitle":"Journal of general internal medicine","issue":"9","ISSN":"0884-8734","creators":[{"firstName":"K","lastName":"Kroenke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"R L","lastName":"Spitzer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J B","lastName":"Williams","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["68f586a9-fb34-4128-bd99-f13db07f7a56"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["b603e4c2-3a0c-3fe1-a95d-3f124c1d0b92"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:55Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/GH7GHDK3","itemID":862,"attachments":[{"key":"QNNU48NC","version":318,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1495268","parentItem":"GH7GHDK3","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:55Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/QNNU48NC"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611741,"version":0},"$loki":129},{"itemID":870,"item":{"key":"4B2P6X3S","version":319,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Anxiety, Depression, and Cardiac Outcomes after a first Acute Coronary Syndrome","abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE Depression is an established risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with an impact on cardiac prognosis; nonetheless, the literature disagrees on the role played by anxiety. No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95% CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7% = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.","date":"2009","extra":"PMID: 19834052\nCitation Key: Bosch2009\nISBN: 6060600980","volume":"71","pages":"944-950","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181bc756b","issue":"9","ISSN":"00333174","creators":[{"firstName":"Nienke M.","lastName":"Bosch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harriëtte","lastName":"Riese","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Dietrich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Ormel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frank C.","lastName":"Verhulst","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Albertine J.","lastName":"Oldehinkel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Baroreflex","type":1},{"tag":"Heart rate","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomic function","type":1},{"tag":"Cortisol","type":1},{"tag":"Children","type":1},{"tag":"Depressive symptoms","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["d7608568-d334-4cbc-880e-4dac8c7ec3eb"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["e16d18f1-758e-39d7-bcfe-cbf33554c6e1"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:56Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ZSB6D3SR","itemID":874,"attachments":[{"key":"8ES9D8QE","version":607,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"ZSB6D3SR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2009 - Bosch et al. - Preadolescents' somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related to cardiac autonomi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["d48fb8010bb83b3e7a5da952169f94184e433909"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:41:58Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:41:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/8ES9D8QE","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/8ES9D8QE/2009 - Bosch et al. - Preadolescents' somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related to cardiac autonomi.pdf","defaultPath":"files/875/2009 - Bosch et al. - Preadolescents' somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related to cardiac autonomi.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611744,"version":0},"$loki":131},{"itemID":876,"item":{"key":"6SZMPR8I","version":320,"itemType":"report","title":"Change in heart rate and heart rate variability during treatment for depression in patients with coronary heart disease","abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.","date":"2000","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11020093","extra":"PMID: 11020093\nPublication Title: Psychosomatic Medicine\nVolume: 62\nDOI: 10.1097/00006842-200009000-00007\nCitation Key: Carney2000\nIssue: 5\nISBN: 0033-3174\nISSN: 00333174","pages":"639-647","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Phyllis K.","lastName":"Stein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Judith A.","lastName":"Skala","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Hoffman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Allan S.","lastName":"Jaffe","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heart rate variability","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Coronary heart disease","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["40342f6f-d6d6-48a4-aa80-40697dffafa2"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["b7e29523-665f-367c-9339-248e359e9d15"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T00:02:56Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/6SZMPR8I","itemID":876,"attachments":[{"key":"C6B2XQY7","version":320,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"6SZMPR8I","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2000 - Carney et al. - Change in heart rate and heart rate variability during treatment for depression in patients with coronary heart d.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["526d1d95d0b4c6bf24c60b3b8b4ef0ecf3897c3f"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:41:59Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:42:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/C6B2XQY7","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/C6B2XQY7/2000 - Carney et al. - Change in heart rate and heart rate variability during treatment for depression in patients with coronary heart d.pdf","defaultPath":"files/877/2000 - Carney et al. - Change in heart rate and heart rate variability during treatment for depression in patients with coronary heart d.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611745,"version":0},"$loki":132},{"itemID":998,"item":{"key":"GD32JPHC","version":332,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Depression as a risk factor for poor prognosis among patients with acute coronary syndrome: Systematic review and recommendations: A scientific statement from the american heart association","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND - : Although prospective studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have documented an association between depression and increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of cardiac populations, depression has not yet achieved formal recognition as a risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome by the American Heart Association and other health organizations. The purpose of this scientific statement is to review available evidence and recommend whether depression should be elevated to the status of a risk factor for patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS - : Writing group members were approved by the American Heart Association's Scientific Statement and Manuscript Oversight Committees. A systematic literature review on depression and adverse medical outcomes after acute coronary syndrome was conducted that included all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and composite outcomes for mortality and nonfatal events. The review assessed the strength, consistency, independence, and generalizability of the published studies. A total of 53 individual studies (32 reported on associations with all-cause mortality, 12 on cardiac mortality, and 22 on composite outcomes) and 4 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of the demographic composition of study samples, definition and measurement of depression, length of follow-up, and covariates included in the multivariable models. Despite limitations in some individual studies, our review identified generally consistent associations between depression and adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS - : Despite the heterogeneity of published studies included in this review, the preponderance of evidence supports the recommendation that the American Heart Association should elevate depression to the status of a risk factor for adverse medical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","date":"2014-03-25","accessDate":"2019-10-19","extra":"Publisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins\nCitation Key: Lichtman2014","volume":"129","pages":"1350-1369","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIR.0000000000000019","issue":"12","ISSN":"15244539","creators":[{"firstName":"Judith H.","lastName":"Lichtman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erika S.","lastName":"Froelicher","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James A.","lastName":"Blumenthal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lynn V.","lastName":"Doering","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Frasure-Smith","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Allan S.","lastName":"Jaffe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erica C.","lastName":"Leifheit-Limson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David S.","lastName":"Sheps","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lawson","lastName":"Wulsin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"depression","type":1},{"tag":"coronary heart disease","type":1},{"tag":"acute coronary syndrome","type":1},{"tag":"AHA Scientific Statements","type":1},{"tag":"risk factors","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["f03e4939-63e2-3e28-a5c3-48c868a287da"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["f03e4939-63e2-3e28-a5c3-48c868a287da"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T13:55:48Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/GD32JPHC","itemID":998,"attachments":[{"key":"C3UV69LE","version":332,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"GD32JPHC","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["43e9d6355e00f6eea440fff2b44771c03b4e8bcd"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:42:50Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:42:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/C3UV69LE","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/C3UV69LE/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/999/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611746,"version":0},"$loki":133},{"itemID":1000,"item":{"key":"Y8PSZLLQ","version":332,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Screening and Management of Depression in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease: JACC State-of-the-Art Review","abstractNote":"Depression is a common problem in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with increased mortality, excess disability, greater health care expenditures, and reduced quality of life.

As such, standardized screening pathways for depression in patients with CVD offer the potential for early identification and optimal management of depression to improve health outcomes.

Method: A systematic literature search was performed (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO; 1975-2011) without language restrictions. Studies investigating the impact of post-MI depression on cardiovascular outcome, defined as all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality and cardiac events within 24 months after the index MI, were identified. Depression had to be assessed within 3 months after MI using established instruments. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random effects model. Results: A total of 29 studies were identified, resulting in 41 comparisons. Follow-up (on average 16 months) was described for 16,889 MI patients. Post-MI depression was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [(OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-2.93; P<.001], cardiac mortality (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.68-4.36; P<.001) and cardiac events (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.37-1.85; P<.001). ORs proved robust in subgroup analyses but declined over the years for cardiac events.

Patients with CVD have more depression than the general population. Persons with depression are more likely to eventually develop CVD and also have a higher mortality rate than the general population. Patients with CVD, who are also depressed, have a worse outcome than those patients who are not depressed. There is a graded relationship: the more severe the depression, the higher the subsequent risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events. It is possible that depression is only a marker for more severe CVD which so far cannot be detected using our currently available investigations. However, given the increased prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, a causal relationship with either CVD causing more depression or depression causing more CVD and a worse prognosis for CVD is probable. There are many possible pathogenetic mechanisms that have been described, which are plausible and that might well be important. However, whether or not there is a causal relationship, depression is the main driver of quality of life and requires prevention, detection, and management in its own right. Depression after an acute cardiac event is commonly an adjustment disorder than can improve spontaneously with comprehensive cardiac management. Additional management strategies for depressed cardiac patients include cardiac rehabilitation and exercise programmes, general support, cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressant medication, combined approaches, and probably disease management programmes. © The Author 2013.","date":"2014-06-01","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282187","accessDate":"2019-10-19","extra":"PMID: 24282187\nCitation Key: Hare2014","volume":"35","pages":"1365-1372","publicationTitle":"European Heart Journal","DOI":"10.1093/eurheartj/eht462","issue":"21","ISSN":"15229645","creators":[{"firstName":"David L","lastName":"Hare","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samia R","lastName":"Toukhsati","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Johansson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tiny","lastName":"Jaarsma","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Prognosis","type":1},{"tag":"Management","type":1},{"tag":"Cardiovascular disease","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Quality of life","type":1},{"tag":"Screening","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["19fb3bbd-a344-38a4-9204-973f0e6b1685"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["19fb3bbd-a344-38a4-9204-973f0e6b1685"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T15:07:51Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/J45YMAKQ","itemID":1007,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611751,"version":0},"$loki":137},{"itemID":1008,"item":{"key":"B6RCNTK9","version":333,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effects of antidepressant treatment following myocardial infarction","abstractNote":"Background: Depression following myocardial infarction is associated with poor cardiac prognosis.

Objective: To determine whether mortality and recurrent infarction are reduced by treatment of depression and LPSS with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), supplemented with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant when indicated, in patients enrolled within 28 days after MI. Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted from October 1996 to April 2001 in 2481 MI patients (1084 women, 1397 men) enrolled from 8 clinical centers. Major or minor depression was diagnosed by modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and severity by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); LPSS was determined by the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) Social Support Instrument (ESSI). Random allocation was to usual medical care or CBT-based psychosocial intervention. Intervention: Cognitive behavior therapy was initiated at a median of 17 days after the index MI for a median of 11 individual sessions throughout 6 months, plus group therapy when feasible, with SSRIs for patients scoring higher than 24 on the HRSD or having a less than 50% reduction in Beck Depression Inventory scores after 5 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Composite primary end point of death or recurrent MI; secondary outcomes included change in HRSD (for depression) or ESSI scores (for LPSS) at 6 months. Results: Improvement in psychosocial outcomes at 6 months favored treatment: mean (SD) change in HRSD score, -10.1 (7.8) in the depression and psychosocial intervention group vs -8.4 (7.7) in the depression and usual care group (P<.001); mean (SD) change in ESSI score, 5.1 (5.9) in the LPSS and psychosocial intervention group vs 3.4 (6.0) in the LPSS and usual care group (P<.001). After an average follow-up of 29 months, there was no significant difference in event-free survival between usual care (75.9%) and psychosocial intervention (75.8%). There were also no differences in survival between the psychosocial intervention and usual care arms in any of the 3 psychosocial risk groups (depression, LPSS, and depression and LPSS patients). Conclusions: The intervention did not increase event-free survival. The intervention improved depression and social isolation, although the relative improvement in the psychosocial intervention group compared with the usual care group was less than expected due to substantial improvement in usual care patients.","date":"2003-06-18","accessDate":"2019-10-19","extra":"Publisher: American Medical Association\nCitation Key: Berkman2003","volume":"289","pages":"3106-3116","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.289.23.3106","issue":"23","ISSN":"00987484","creators":[{"firstName":"Lisa F.","lastName":"Berkman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Blumenthal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Burg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Diane","lastName":"Catellier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie J.","lastName":"Cowan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan M.","lastName":"Czajkowski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"De Busk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Hosking","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Allan","lastName":"Jaffe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter G.","lastName":"Kaufmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pamela","lastName":"Mitchell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Norman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lynda H.","lastName":"Powell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James M.","lastName":"Raczynski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Schneiderman","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"Raczynski","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["f85f9a8f-d19b-335b-8cde-a7e783424af2"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["f85f9a8f-d19b-335b-8cde-a7e783424af2"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T15:11:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/L9CGN7BC","itemID":1009,"attachments":[{"key":"9RLD58NE","version":333,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"L9CGN7BC","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["b33e7ffe77c709e5cb5f13c396fa85b13471c65c"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:42:53Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:42:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9RLD58NE","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/9RLD58NE/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1010/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611752,"version":0},"$loki":139},{"itemID":1037,"item":{"key":"UNRIKZRN","version":336,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effect of Depression Screening after Acute Coronary Syndromes on Quality of Life: The CODIACS-QoL Randomized Clinical Trial","abstractNote":"Importance: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated depressive symptoms are at increased risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality, worse quality of life, and higher health care costs. These observational findings prompted multiple scientific panels to advise universal depression screening in survivors of ACS prior to evidence from randomized screening trials. Objective: To determine whether systematically screening for depression in survivors of ACS improves quality of life and depression compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-group multisite randomized trial enrolled 1500 patients with ACS from 4 health care systems between November 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, with follow-up ending July 31, 2018. Patients were eligible if they had been hospitalized for ACS in the previous 2 to 12 months and had no prior history of depression. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: Patients with ACS were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive (1) systematic depression screening using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with notification of primary care clinicians and provision of centralized, patient-preference, stepped depression care for those with positive screening results (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10; screen, notify, and treat, n = 499); (2) systematic depression screening, with notification of primary care clinicians for those with positive screening results (screen and notify, n = 501); and (3) usual care (no screening, n = 500). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in quality-adjusted life-years. The secondary outcome was depression-free days. Adverse effects and mortality were assessed by patient interview and hospital records. Results: A total of 1500 patients (424 women and 1076 men; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [11.5] years) were randomized in the 18-month trial. Only 71 of 1000 eligible survivors of ACS (7.1%) had elevated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores indicating depressive symptoms at screening. There were no differences in mean (SD) change in quality-adjusted life-years (screen, notify and treat, -0.06 [0.20]; screen and notify, -0.06 [0.20]; no screen, -0.06 [0.18]; P =.98) or cumulative mean (SD) depression-free days (screen, notify and treat, 343.1 [179.0] days; screen and notify, 351.3 [175.0] days; no screen, 339.0 [176.6] days; P =.63). Harms including death, bleeding, or sleep difficulties did not differ among groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with ACS without a history of depression, systematic depression screening with or without providing depression treatment did not alter quality-adjusted life-years, depression-free days, or harms.

We performed a literature search of the CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases from January 1966 to June 2013 and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved articles and included meeting abstracts and unpublished results from experts in the field. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with inverse-variance-weighted random-effect models. The systematic review included nine independent case-crossover studies of anger outbursts and MI/ACS (four studies), ischaemic stroke (two studies), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (one study), and ventricular arrhythmia (two studies). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 92.5% for MI/ACS and 89.8% for ischaemic stroke).

An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p<.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","date":"2013","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.01.019","extra":"PMID: 23434412\narXiv: NIHMS150003\nPublisher: Elsevier\nCitation Key: Shah2013\nISBN: 1873-2402 (Electronic) 0006-3223 (Linking)","volume":"73","pages":"1103-1110","publicationTitle":"Biological Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.01.019","issue":"11","ISSN":"00063223","creators":[{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Lampert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emir","lastName":"Veledar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Studies have suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may result in cardiovascular disease. However, many past studies had important methodological limitations to their designs.\\n\\nMETHOD: Using Cox regressions, we assessed PTSD, age, race, intelligence, family history, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, antisocial personality, and depression in predicting HD mortality at follow-up in December 31, 2000. The men were <65 years old at follow-up.\\n\\nRESULTS: Using two PTSD measures, a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition (DSM-III) measure (D-PTSD) and one developed by Keane (K-PTSD), we found that among Vietnam theater and era veterans combined (era veterans had no Vietnam service), having PTSD was associated with HD mortality for D-PTSD (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25, p = .045) and approached significance for K-PTSD (HR = 2.16, p = .066). However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20% increase in mortality risk (all p < .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline. This study suggests that early-age HD may be an outcome after military service among PTSD-positive veterans.","date":"2008-07","url":"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-200807000-00007","accessDate":"2018-10-27","extra":"PMID: 18596248\nCitation Key: Boscarino2008\nISBN: 1534-7796 (Electronic)\\r0033-3174 (Linking)","volume":"70","pages":"668-676","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e31817bccaf","issue":"6","ISSN":"00333174","creators":[{"firstName":"Joseph A","lastName":"Boscarino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cardiovascular disease","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","type":1},{"tag":"Survival analysis","type":1},{"tag":"Veterans","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["c58ef7b4-d93c-4242-8ed1-ac36baeb9be0"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["cb9f2e41-57cd-3045-ae58-6556cfeface6"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-30T01:51:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/MKF2ZJ5X","itemID":1051,"attachments":[{"key":"XCHHKVL6","version":337,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18596248","parentItem":"MKF2ZJ5X","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-30T01:51:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/XCHHKVL6"},{"key":"UYRRI7KT","version":337,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3552245","parentItem":"MKF2ZJ5X","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-30T01:51:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/UYRRI7KT"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611758,"version":0},"$loki":144},{"itemID":1054,"item":{"key":"R3Y4QXVF","version":338,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Long-Term Trajectories of PTSD in Vietnam-Era Veterans: The Course and Consequences of PTSD in Twins","abstractNote":"What do we know about resilience in crime victimization?

However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P<.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.","date":"1995-10-01","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7671353","accessDate":"2018-05-31","extra":"PMID: 7671353\nPublisher: American Heart Association, Inc.\nCitation Key: Mittleman1995\nISBN: 0009-7322 (Print)\\r0009-7322 (Linking)","volume":"92","pages":"1720-1725","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.92.7.1720","issue":"7","ISSN":"00097322","creators":[{"firstName":"Murray A","lastName":"Mittleman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Malcolm","lastName":"Maclure","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jane B","lastName":"Sherwood","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard P","lastName":"Mulry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Geoffrey H","lastName":"Tofler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sue C","lastName":"Jacobs","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Friedman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Benson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James E","lastName":"Muller","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"myocardial infarction","type":1},{"tag":"anger","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["78363bd8-e949-4dc9-bd9a-1d44323307d7"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["ea17e99c-d2df-39e6-835f-3ae1b686ecf3"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-30T01:51:53Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:36:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9BYMXUQ3","itemID":1059,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611766,"version":0},"$loki":146},{"itemID":1060,"item":{"key":"3KG2WQFD","version":338,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Anger proneness predicts coronary heart disease risk: Prospective analysis from the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Increased research attention is being paid to the negative impact of anger on coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of \"hard\" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) was 1.54 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.64) for \"hard\" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of \"hard\" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger. The multivariate-adjusted HR of CHD for high versus low anger was 2.20 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.55) and for moderate versus low anger was 1.32 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.84). For \"hard\" events, the multivariate-adjusted HRs were 2.69 (95% CI 1.48 to 4.90) and 1.35 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.10), respectively. No statistically significant association between trait anger and incident CHD risk was observed among hypertensive individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Proneness to anger places normotensive middle-aged men and women at significant risk for CHD morbidity and death independent of the established biological risk factors.","date":"2000","url":"http://www.circulationaha.org","accessDate":"2019-06-03","extra":"Citation Key: Williams2000","volume":"101","pages":"2034-2039","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.101.17.2034","issue":"17","ISSN":"00097322","creators":[{"firstName":"Janice E","lastName":"Williams","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Catherine C","lastName":"Paton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ilene C","lastName":"Siegler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marsha L","lastName":"Eigenbrodt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"F.

Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia. Methods [99mTc]-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography was performed at rest, after mental stress (a social stressor with a speech task) and after exercise/pharmacologic stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed-difference score, the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used to assess different anger dimensions. Results The mean age was 50 years, 50% were female, and 60% were non-white. After adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, coronary artery disease severity, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, each IQR increment in state-anger score was associated with 0.36 U-adjusted increase in ischemia as measured by the summed-difference score (95% CI 0.14-0.59); the corresponding association for trait anger was 0.95 (95% CI 0.21-1.69). Anger expression scales were not associated with ischemia. None of the anger dimensions was related to ischemia during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Conclusion Anger, both as an emotional state and as a personality trait, is significantly associated with propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress but not during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Patients with this psychologic profile may be at increased risk for silent ischemia induced by emotional stress, and this may translate into worse prognosis.

We examined whether patients with CAD who suppress their anger are at risk of adverse events. At baseline, 644 patients with CAD completed measures of anger, anger-in (reluctance to express anger), and Type D personality (tendency to experience distress and to be inhibited). The combination of high anger and anger-in scores was used to identify the presence of suppressed anger. The end points were major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. After an average follow-up of 6.3 years (range 5 to 10), 126 patients (20%) had experienced a major adverse cardiac event, and 59 (9%) had experienced cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Anger (p = 0.009) and suppressed anger (p = 0.011) were associated with future major adverse cardiac events, but these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, suppressed anger remained associated with the more rigorous end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.87, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 7.15, p = 0.024) after controlling for decreased systolic function, poor exercise tolerance, extent of CAD, and revascularization. Anger alone was not independently associated with this end point. Patients with a Type D personality had a fourfold rate of suppressed anger, and an adjustment for a Type D personality attenuated the observed association between suppressed anger and adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, patients with CAD who suppress their anger were at increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and this was accounted for by individual differences in Type D personality. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We therefore assessed the extent to which the association between social isolation and mortality is mediated by loneliness. We assessed social isolation in terms of contact with family and friends and participation in civic organizations in 6,500 men and women aged 52 and older who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2004-2005. A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March 2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox proportional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. However, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.09). The association of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with social isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely to be more relevant to mortality.","date":"2013-04-09","accessDate":"2019-10-29","extra":"PMID: 23530191\nCitation Key: Steptoe2013a","volume":"110","pages":"5797-5801","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1219686110","issue":"15","ISSN":"00278424","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Steptoe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aparna","lastName":"Shankar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Panayotes","lastName":"Demakakos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Wardle","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["7a56e6d2-0a1e-3694-ad37-7ed5a90fadb2"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["7a56e6d2-0a1e-3694-ad37-7ed5a90fadb2"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-30T01:53:41Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/DN7TL4U4","itemID":1068,"attachments":[{"key":"KAB52QHD","version":339,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"DN7TL4U4","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["874f120b84ab2a3a3c9f13d795cfc24b9cd12aa3"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:43:10Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:43:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/KAB52QHD","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/KAB52QHD/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1069/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611772,"version":0},"$loki":152},{"itemID":1071,"item":{"key":"R2ABEC34","version":339,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Associations of psychosocial factors with heart rate and its short-term variability: Multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis","abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of psychosocial factors with heart rate (HR) and its variability across multiple ethnic groups and by gender. Increased HR and reduced HR variability are markers of increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2002, 6814 men and women (2624 Whites, 1895 African-Americans, 1492 Hispanics, and 803 Chinese) aged 45 to 84 years took part in the first examination of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Associations of psychosocial variables with mean values of HR and its short-term variability were tested, using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: In age, gender, race/ethnicity, and risk factor-adjusted analyses, a depressive symptom score was positively associated with HR and inversely associated with HR variability (standard deviation of normal-to-normal (N-N) interbeat intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in N-N intervals (RMSSD)). The adjusted mean differences per 1-SD (8 points) increment of depression score for HR, RMSSD, and SDNN were 0.5 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2-0.7), -0.8 (95% CI, -1.5 to -0.2), and -0.7 (95% CI, -1.1 to -0.2). The social support score was inversely associated with HR, but nonsignificantly associated with RMSSD and SDNN. There was no association of trait anger or trait anxiety with HR, RMSSD, or SDNN. Associations were generally consistent in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings generally support the hypothesis that depression may be associated with increased HR and reduced HR variability, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Methods: This 10-week, acute, randomized, controlled, masked trial compared adjunctive VNS with sham treatment in 235 outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (n = 210) or nonpsychotic, depressed phase, bipolar disorder (n = 25). In the current episode, participants had not responded adequately to between two and six research-qualified medication trials. A two-week, single-blind recovery period (no stimulation) and then 10 weeks of masked active or sham VNS followed implantation. Medications were kept stable. Primary efficacy outcome among 222 evaluable participants was based on response rates (<50% reduction from baseline on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD 24]).

Although standards antidepressants are more effective than placebo, up to 35% of patients do not respond to 4 or more conventional treatments and are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Considerable effort has been devoted to trying to find effective treatments for TRD. This review focuses on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), approved for TRD in 2005 by the Food and Drugs Administration. Stimulation is carried by bipolar electrodes on the left cervical vagus nerve, which are attached to an implanted stimulator generator. The vagus bundle contains about 80% of afferent fibers terminating in the medulla, from which there are projections to many areas of brain, including the limbic forebrain. Various types of brain imaging studies reveal widespread functional effects in brain after either acute or chronic VNS. Although more randomized control trials of VNS need to be carried out before a definitive conclusion can be reached about its efficacy, the results of open studies, carried out over period of 1 to 2 years, show much more efficacy when compared with results from treatment as usual studies. There is an increase in clinical response to VNS between 3 and 12 months, which is quite different from that seen with standard antidepressant treatment of MDD. Preclinically, VNS affects many of the same brain areas, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) and signal transduction mechanisms (brain-derived neurotrophic factor–tropomyosin receptor kinase B) as those found with traditional antidepressants. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which VNS benefits patients nonresponsive to conventional antidepressants is unclear, with further research needed to clarify this.","date":"2017-07-01","accessDate":"2019-11-12","extra":"Publisher: Springer New York LLC\nCitation Key: Carreno2017b","volume":"14","pages":"716-727","publicationTitle":"Neurotherapeutics","DOI":"10.1007/s13311-017-0537-8","issue":"3","ISSN":"18787479","creators":[{"firstName":"Flavia R.","lastName":"Carreno","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Frazer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"BDNF-TrkB","type":1},{"tag":"Monoamines","type":1},{"tag":"TRD","type":1},{"tag":"VNS","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["20cbbd1f-ea8d-3c24-b503-335cbec56e65"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["20cbbd1f-ea8d-3c24-b503-335cbec56e65"]},"dateAdded":"2019-11-13T02:41:45Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/X5BT2CTD","itemID":1076,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611774,"version":0},"$loki":155},{"itemID":1084,"item":{"key":"LPPMZWM7","version":341,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Depression Is the Leading Cause of Disability Around the World","abstractNote":"The proportion of the global population living with depression is estimated to be 322 million people—4.4% of the world’s population—according to a new report, “Depression and Other Common Mental Disorders: Global Health Estimates,” released by the World Health Organization.

Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory (\"Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test\", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed (\"Digit Symbol Substitution Test\", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function (\"Stroop interference\"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7% female, 42.2% Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: β = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: β = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: β = 1.19 points better, P < 0.05; and quartile2: β = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: β = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: β = 1.72 points better, P < 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that higher quartile SDDN is associated with better executive function in midlife, above, and beyond cardiovascular risk factors.","date":"2018","extra":"PMID: 28985245\nCitation Key: ZekiAlHazzouri2018c","volume":"31","pages":"27-34","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Hypertension","DOI":"10.1093/ajh/hpx125","issue":"1","ISSN":"19417225","creators":[{"firstName":"Adina","lastName":"Zeki Al Hazzouri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tali","lastName":"Elfassy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mercedes R","lastName":"Carnethon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Donald M","lastName":"Lloyd-Jones","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristine","lastName":"Yaffe","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["c86ad12b-6b6a-408c-8119-1b240e1db29b"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["63412268-493d-3943-a642-8e2a34fa79b9"]},"dateAdded":"2019-11-20T00:55:13Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/735NKLW6","itemID":1088,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611776,"version":0},"$loki":157},{"itemID":1089,"item":{"key":"57XYVHIB","version":341,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The economic burden of adults with major depressive disorder in the United States (2005 and 2010)","abstractNote":"Background: The economic burden of depression in the United States-including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia-was estimated at $83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders. Method: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010. Results: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5% (from $173.2 billion to $210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45% attributable to direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 50% to workplace costs. Only 38% of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.","date":"2015-02-01","accessDate":"2019-11-20","extra":"PMID: 25742202\nPublisher: Physicians Postgraduate Press Inc.\nCitation Key: Greenberg2015b","volume":"76","pages":"155-162","publicationTitle":"Journal of Clinical Psychiatry","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.14m09298","issue":"2","ISSN":"01606689","creators":[{"firstName":"Paul E.","lastName":"Greenberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andree Anne","lastName":"Fournier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tammy","lastName":"Sisitsky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Crystal T.","lastName":"Pike","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronald C.","lastName":"Kessler","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["64bee70f-ff58-3c82-9fae-b8eabae9f440"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["64bee70f-ff58-3c82-9fae-b8eabae9f440"]},"dateAdded":"2019-11-21T00:26:24Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/57XYVHIB","itemID":1089,"attachments":[{"key":"U45462NQ","version":341,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"57XYVHIB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["e8268b32b2365acf66068c589ccd12cc7f076f2b"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:43:16Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:43:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/U45462NQ","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/U45462NQ/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1090/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611777,"version":0},"$loki":158},{"itemID":1092,"item":{"key":"6S45N3CH","version":341,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sympathetic Nervous System Activity in Major Depression: Basal and Desipramine-Induced Alterations in Plasma Norepinephrine Kinetics","date":"1994","accessDate":"2019-11-21","extra":"Citation Key: Veith1994b","volume":"51","pages":"411-422","publicationTitle":"Archives of General Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1001/archpsyc.1994.03950050071008","issue":"5","ISSN":"15383636","creators":[{"firstName":"Richard C.","lastName":"Veith","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Lewis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oscar A.","lastName":"Linares","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert F.","lastName":"Barnes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Murray A.","lastName":"Raskind","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Enrique C.","lastName":"Villacres","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.

Significant group by trial interaction effects was found for systolic blood pressure following administration of verbal fluency [F(1,54) = 5.86, p < 0.05] and nonverbal fluency stressors [F(1,54) = 13.68, p < .001]. Similar interactions were seen for systolic heart rate following administration of verbal fluency [F(1,54) = 5.86, p < .005] and nonverbal fluency stressors [F(1,54) = 13.68, p < .001]. The corresponding results are discussed in terms of functional cerebral systems and potential implications for physiological models of anger. Given the association between anger and negative physical health outcomes, there is a clear need to better understand the physiological components of anger. The results of this experiment indicate that a repressive “anger in” expression style is associated with deregulation of the right frontal region. This same region has been shown to be intimately involved in cardiovascular recovery, glucose metabolism, and blood pressure regulation.","date":"2017-12-01","accessDate":"2020-01-16","extra":"Publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg\nCitation Key: Cox2017b","volume":"4","pages":"231-239","publicationTitle":"Brain Informatics","DOI":"10.1007/s40708-017-0068-4","issue":"4","ISSN":"21984026","creators":[{"firstName":"David E.","lastName":"Cox","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin B.","lastName":"DeVore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patti Kelly","lastName":"Harrison","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David W.","lastName":"Harrison","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Anger","type":1},{"tag":"Brain asymmetry","type":1},{"tag":"Cardiovascular response","type":1},{"tag":"Hostility","type":1},{"tag":"Laterality","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["d87500cb-2ac7-3343-8323-6baf8fb3e202"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["d87500cb-2ac7-3343-8323-6baf8fb3e202"]},"dateAdded":"2020-01-17T00:48:56Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:36:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/FCZBATVT","itemID":1159,"attachments":[{"key":"JL4NJGE4","version":348,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"FCZBATVT","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["a1c5c4887c487b9e6aa78128c307d344004143fa"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:43:40Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:43:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/JL4NJGE4","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/JL4NJGE4/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1160/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611779,"version":0},"$loki":161},{"itemID":1169,"item":{"key":"EZISSM7D","version":349,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Efficacy of HRV-biofeedback as additional treatment of depression and PTSD.","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND Heartrate variability biofeedback (HRVB) is a non-invasive treatment in which patients are assumed to self-regulate a physiological dysregulated vagal nerve. Although the therapeutic approach of HRVB is promising in various stress-related disorders, it has only been offered on a regular basis in a few mental health treatment settings. AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy. More research needs to be done with larger groups and further efforts are needed to integrate HRVB into treatment of stress-related disorders in psychiatry.

The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29% (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.26; P≥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes. Comprehensive screening and treatment of both somatic and cognitive symptoms may be necessary to optimize depression recognition and treatment in AMI patients.

Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9<10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7%) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4%) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1% versus 6.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8% versus 6.1%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.62). CONCLUSIONS Although depression in patients with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to patients with untreated depression.","date":"2017","accessDate":"2018-10-24","extra":"PMID: 28209727\nCitation Key: Smolderen2017\nISBN: 8169325846","volume":"135","pages":"1681-1689","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.025140","issue":"18","ISSN":"15244539","creators":[{"firstName":"Kim G.","lastName":"Smolderen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Donna M.","lastName":"Buchanan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kensey","lastName":"Gosch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Whooley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul S.","lastName":"Chan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Parashar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P.

Methods: We examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and 1-month biomarker levels (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], white blood cell [WBC], platelet counts) in 1265 AMI patients. Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. Results: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B per SD increase =.02, 95% confidence interval:.00;.05, p =.07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B per SD increase =.28, 95% confidence interval:.12;.44, p <.001).

Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.","date":"2018-12","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584618305839?dgcid=rss_sd_all","extra":"Citation Key: Locci2018","publicationTitle":"Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.014","ISSN":"02785846","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Locci","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Graziano","lastName":"Pinna","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["99c9bac8-afb6-4eca-869e-84bba0f7a383"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["0736bc3c-6710-3b3a-aad4-5762291e9915"]},"dateAdded":"2020-03-26T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/KV375SFE","itemID":1441,"attachments":[{"key":"JPPWWM9E","version":377,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278584618305839","parentItem":"KV375SFE","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-03-26T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/JPPWWM9E"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611785,"version":0},"$loki":166},{"itemID":1450,"item":{"key":"AJ5YC2TB","version":377,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genomic predictors of combat stress vulnerability and resilience in U.S. Marines: A genome-wide association study across multiple ancestries implicates PRTFDC1 as a potential PTSD gene","abstractNote":"Background: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. Methods: Participants (. N=. 3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: The array produced >800K directly genotyped and >21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04×10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p<5×10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. Conclusions: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups. We found evidence for PRTFDC1 as a potential novel PTSD gene, a finding that awaits further replication. Our findings indicate that the genetic architecture of PTSD may be determined by many SNPs with small effects, and overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders, consistent with current findings from large GWAS of other psychiatric disorders.","date":"2015-01","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25456346","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 25456346\nCitation Key: Nievergelt2015\nISBN: 0306-4530","volume":"51","pages":"459-471","publicationTitle":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","DOI":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.10.017","ISSN":"18733360","creators":[{"firstName":"Caroline M.","lastName":"Nievergelt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adam X.","lastName":"Maihofer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Mustapic","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kate A.","lastName":"Yurgil","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicholas J.","lastName":"Schork","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark W.","lastName":"Miller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark W.","lastName":"Logue","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark A.","lastName":"Geyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Victoria B.","lastName":"Risbrough","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel T.","lastName":"O'Connor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dewleen G.","lastName":"Baker","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Meta-analysis","type":1},{"tag":"PTSD","type":1},{"tag":"Bipolar disorder","type":1},{"tag":"GWAS","type":1},{"tag":"Ancestry","type":1},{"tag":"GxE","type":1},{"tag":"Pleiotropy","type":1},{"tag":"Polygenic risk score","type":1},{"tag":"Trauma","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4","48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["09e7c1a6-8372-4e29-8bcb-7dcdb5c174af"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["1356dfaa-5edd-38b0-b407-10d8ec337038"]},"dateAdded":"2020-03-26T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/AJ5YC2TB","itemID":1450,"attachments":[{"key":"GZWAKM7D","version":377,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306453014004016","parentItem":"AJ5YC2TB","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-03-26T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/GZWAKM7D"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611786,"version":0},"$loki":167},{"itemID":1470,"item":{"key":"NVR58R6X","version":379,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A brief measure of social support: Practical and theoretical implications","abstractNote":"Two studies leading to the development of a short form of the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ) are reported.

It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure contributes to the risk for development of PTSD. OBJECTIVE To examine whether HRV before combat deployment is associated with increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment when accounting for deployment-related combat exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between July 14, 2008, and May 24, 2012, active-duty Marines were assessed 1 to 2 months before a combat deployment and again 4 to 6 months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Participants in the second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to April 16, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predeployment HRVwas measured via finger photoplethysmography during a 5-minute period of rest. Frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. Diagnosis of PTSD was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. RESULTS After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, lower HRV before deployment as measured by an increased low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) ratio of HRV was associated with risk of PTSD diagnosis after deployment (combined MRS-I and MRS-II cohortmeta-analysis odds ratio, 1.47; 95%CI, 1.10-1.98; P = .01). The prevalence of postdeployment PTSD was higher in participants with high predeployment LF:HF ratios (15.8% [6 of 38 participants]) compared with participants who did not have high LF:HF ratios (3.7%[78 of 2122 participants]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This prospective longitudinal study provides initial and modest evidence that an altered state of autonomic nervous system functioning contributes to PTSD vulnerability, taking into account other key risk factors. If these findings are replicated, interventions that change autonomic nervous system function may open novel opportunities for prevention and treatment of PTSD.","date":"2015-10-01","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26353072/","accessDate":"2020-08-28","extra":"PMID: 26353072\nPublisher: American Medical Association\nCitation Key: Minassian2015","volume":"72","pages":"979-986","publicationTitle":"JAMA Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0922","issue":"10","ISSN":"2168622X","creators":[{"firstName":"Arpi","lastName":"Minassian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adam X.","lastName":"Maihofer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dewleen G.","lastName":"Baker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Caroline M.","lastName":"Nievergelt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark A.","lastName":"Geyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Victoria B.","lastName":"Risbrough","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard L.","lastName":"Hauger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mingxiong","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jennifer A.","lastName":"Murphy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert K.","lastName":"Naviaux","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kate","lastName":"Yurgil","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anjana","lastName":"Patel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"De La Rosa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Gorman","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Male","type":1},{"tag":"Adult","type":1},{"tag":"Prospective Studies","type":1},{"tag":"Risk","type":1},{"tag":"Research Support","type":1},{"tag":"U.S. Gov't","type":1},{"tag":"MEDLINE","type":1},{"tag":"National Center for Biotechnology Information","type":1},{"tag":"National Institutes of Health","type":1},{"tag":"National Library of Medicine","type":1},{"tag":"NCBI","type":1},{"tag":"NIH","type":1},{"tag":"NLM","type":1},{"tag":"PubMed Abstract","type":1},{"tag":"2003-2011","type":1},{"tag":"Adam X Maihofer","type":1},{"tag":"Afghan Campaign 2001-","type":1},{"tag":"Arpi Minassian","type":1},{"tag":"Cohort Studies","type":1},{"tag":"doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0922","type":1},{"tag":"Extramural","type":1},{"tag":"Heart Rate / physiology*","type":1},{"tag":"Iraq War","type":1},{"tag":"Logistic Models","type":1},{"tag":"Longitudinal Studies","type":1},{"tag":"Marine Resiliency Study Team","type":1},{"tag":"Military Personnel / psychology*","type":1},{"tag":"Multivariate Analysis","type":1},{"tag":"N.I.H.","type":1},{"tag":"Non-P.H.S.","type":1},{"tag":"Photoplethysmography","type":1},{"tag":"pmid:26353072","type":1},{"tag":"Post-Traumatic / epidemiology*","type":1},{"tag":"Prevalence","type":1},{"tag":"Stress Disorders","type":1},{"tag":"Young Adult","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["7be86bf4-a71d-31e7-9b90-dc4765556894"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["7be86bf4-a71d-31e7-9b90-dc4765556894"]},"dateAdded":"2020-08-28T12:37:27Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:37:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/JVNXTZXE","itemID":1643,"attachments":[{"key":"39W958F8","version":479,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"JVNXTZXE","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["1efc007eeeb00d318a017797dab912c1f966e5b7"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:46:48Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:46:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/39W958F8","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/39W958F8/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1644/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611789,"version":0},"$loki":169},{"itemID":1728,"item":{"key":"QLWJMY46","version":405,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The role of inflammation in core features of depression: Insights from paradigms using exogenously-induced inflammation","abstractNote":"A wealth of evidence has implicated inflammation in the development of depression. Yet, the heterogeneous nature of depression has impeded efforts to understand, prevent, and treat the disease. The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize the connections between inflammation and established core features of depression that exhibit more homogeneity than the syndrome itself: exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward processing, decreased cognitive control, and somatic syndrome. For each core feature, we first provide a brief overview of its relevance to depression and neurobiological underpinnings, and then review evidence investigating a potential role of inflammation. We focus primarily on findings from experimental paradigms of exogenously-induced inflammation. We conclude that inflammation likely plays a role in exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward reactivity, and somatic symptoms. There is less evidence supporting an effect of inflammation on cognitive control as assessed by standard neuropsychological measures. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and recommendationsfor how to test the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of heterogeneous psychiatric disorders.","date":"2018-11-01","url":"/pmc/articles/PMC6192535/?report=abstract","accessDate":"2020-11-04","extra":"PMID: 30201219\nPublisher: Elsevier Ltd\nCitation Key: Dooley2018","volume":"94","pages":"219-237","publicationTitle":"Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.09.006","ISSN":"18737528","creators":[{"firstName":"Larissa N.","lastName":"Dooley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kate R.","lastName":"Kuhlman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Theodore F.","lastName":"Robles","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Naomi I.","lastName":"Eisenberger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michelle G.","lastName":"Craske","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Julienne E.","lastName":"Bower","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"Inflammation","type":1},{"tag":"Mood","type":1},{"tag":"Cognitive control","type":1},{"tag":"Endophenotype","type":1},{"tag":"Reward","type":1},{"tag":"Somatic","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["89c97912-e41f-3186-ab40-9533ab970647"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["89c97912-e41f-3186-ab40-9533ab970647"]},"dateAdded":"2020-11-05T02:50:42Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/QLWJMY46","itemID":1728,"attachments":[{"key":"XXT7DHW9","version":405,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6192535/","parentItem":"QLWJMY46","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-11-05T02:50:42Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/XXT7DHW9"},{"key":"WR6PD25Q","version":405,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"QLWJMY46","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["a0eb4ab962cc978c1942aafea03156522573dc23"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:35Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:47:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WR6PD25Q","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WR6PD25Q/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1730/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611790,"version":0},"$loki":170},{"itemID":1734,"item":{"key":"ABKLAATF","version":406,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"High cardiac vagal control protects against future depressive symptoms under conditions of high social support","abstractNote":"High cardiac vagal control (as measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) is associated with lower depression. Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association. This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA. To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults. Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms. Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms. Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support. The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement. These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes.

There are many ways that the dysregulation of the HPA axis can be assessed: by sampling diurnal basal secretion and/or in response to a stress task, pharmacological challenge, and awakening. Here, we focus on the association between cortisol awakening response (CAR), as one index of HPA axis function, and MDD, given that the nature of this association is particularly unclear. Indeed, in the following selective review, we attempt to reconcile sometimes-divergent evidence of the role of CAR in the pathway to depression. We first examine association of CAR with psychological factors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to develop depression. Then, we summarize the findings regarding the CAR profile in those with current depression, and evaluate evidence for the role of CAR following depression resolution and continued vulnerability. Finally, we showcase longitudinal studies showing the role of CAR in predicting depression onset and recurrence. Overall, the studies reveal an important, but complex, association between CAR and vulnerability to depression.","date":"2015-05-14","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25999722/","accessDate":"2021-04-02","extra":"Publisher: Dove Medical Press Ltd.\nCitation Key: Dedovic2015","volume":"11","pages":"1181-1189","publicationTitle":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","DOI":"10.2147/NDT.S62289","ISSN":"11782021","creators":[{"firstName":"Katarina","lastName":"Dedovic","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Janice","lastName":"Ngiam","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"MDD","type":1},{"tag":"Daily hassles","type":1},{"tag":"Environmental factors","type":1},{"tag":"Genetic influence","type":1},{"tag":"HPA axis","type":1},{"tag":"SCN","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["46d9e51f-be02-3fb7-8635-b7ce61f48110"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["46d9e51f-be02-3fb7-8635-b7ce61f48110"]},"dateAdded":"2021-04-02T23:40:44Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9IBVNCXN","itemID":1782,"attachments":[{"key":"MX65XP7Z","version":410,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25999722/?dopt=Abstract","parentItem":"9IBVNCXN","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-04-02T23:40:44Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/MX65XP7Z"},{"key":"ZA3JC2FJ","version":410,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"9IBVNCXN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["11fd749d9e6cf6ec5f6bd6394dacd04f5ff1d199"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:56Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:47:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ZA3JC2FJ","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/ZA3JC2FJ/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1784/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611793,"version":0},"$loki":173},{"itemID":1867,"item":{"key":"X2B2E9Y5","version":419,"itemType":"bookSection","title":"Ventricular tachycardia and psychiatric depression in patients with coronary artery disease","abstractNote":"purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between psychiatric depression and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The hypothesis was that depressed patients with CAD would have a higher prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) than nondepressed patients with CAD. patients and methods: One hundred three patients who were found to have significant CAD by elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization were administered a standardized psychiatric interview and underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. results: Twenty-one patients (20%) met the criteria for either major or minor depression. There were no significant differences between depressed and nondepressed patients with CAD in severity of CAD or in ventricular function. Five (23.8%) of the depressed patients and three (3.7%) of the nondepressed patients exhibited episodes of VT during 24 hours of Holter monitoring (p <0.008). This difference remained significant even after controlling for relevant covariates. conclusions: We conclude that there is a higher prevalence of VT among patients with CAD and depression than among those CAD patients without depression. This may help to explain the increased risk for cardiac mortality in depressed patients with CAD. © 1993.","date":"1993-07","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/000293439390228H","accessDate":"2022-02-21","extra":"PMID: 8328494\nDOI: 10.1016/0002-9343(93)90228-H\nCitation Key: Callans2004\nIssue: 1\nISSN: 00029343","volume":"95","ISBN":"978-0-7216-0323-0","pages":"23-28","bookTitle":"The American Journal of Medicine","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert M.","lastName":"Carney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth E.","lastName":"Freedland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael W.","lastName":"Rich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laurie J.","lastName":"Smith","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Allan S.","lastName":"Jaffe","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["aae54650-02df-3198-9141-a88725fbbfca"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["aae54650-02df-3198-9141-a88725fbbfca"]},"dateAdded":"2022-02-22T03:04:51Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:38:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/X2B2E9Y5","itemID":1867,"attachments":[{"key":"WVQPLSYH","version":419,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"X2B2E9Y5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["cf8534f6fa72c329f7c301974e247471bebd985e"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:48:43Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:48:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WVQPLSYH","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WVQPLSYH/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1868/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611794,"version":0},"$loki":174},{"itemID":1934,"item":{"key":"XWGMVHQX","version":425,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Post-traumatic stress disorder, coronary atherosclerosis, and mortality","abstractNote":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of multiple medical problems including myocardial infarction. However, a direct link between PTSD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been made. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an excellent method to detect atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association of PTSD to atherosclerotic CAD and mortality. Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 ± 9 years of age, 12.2% women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1% vs 59%, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p <0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1%, vs 57, 10.4%, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score >0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores <400, p <0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, PTSD is associated with presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis and predicts mortality independent of age, gender, and conventional risk factors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Background: Anger can precipitate spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and induce TWA. Whether anger-induced TWA predicts future arrhythmias is unknown. Methods: Sixty-two patients with ICDs underwent ambulatory electrocardiography during a mental stress protocol, 3 months after the ICD was implanted. T-wave alternans was analyzed using time-domain methods. After a ≥1 year follow-up, ICD stored data was reviewed to determine incidence of ICD-terminated ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. Results: Patients with ICD-terminated arrhythmias during follow-up (n = 10) had higher TWA induced by anger, 13.2 μV (interquartile range [IQR] 9.3 to 16 μV), compared with those patients without future ventricular arrhythmias, 9.3 μV (IQR 7.5 to 11.5 μV, p < 0.01). Patients in the highest quartile of anger-induced TWA (>11.9 μV, n = 15) were more likely to experience arrhythmias by 1 year than those in the lower quartiles (33% vs. 4%) and during extended follow-up (40% vs. 9%, p < 0.01 for both). In multivariable regression controlling for ejection fraction, prior clinical arrhythmia, and wide QRS, anger-induced TWA remained a significant predictor of arrhythmia, with likelihood in the top quartile 10.8 times that of other patients (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 113, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Anger-induced TWA predicts future ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ICDs, suggesting that emotion-induced repolarization instability may be 1 mechanism linking stress and sudden death. Whether there is a clinical role for anger-induced TWA testing requires further study. © 2009 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","date":"2009-03-03","url":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2008.10.053","accessDate":"2022-11-08","extra":"PMID: 19245968\nPublisher: American College of Cardiology FoundationWashington, D.C.\nCitation Key: Lampert2009","volume":"53","pages":"774-778","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2008.10.053","issue":"9","ISSN":"07351097","creators":[{"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Lampert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Shusterman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Burg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"McPherson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"William","lastName":"Batsford","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Soufer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"anger","type":1},{"tag":"implantable cardioverter-defibrillator","type":1},{"tag":"tachyarrhythmias (ventricular)","type":1}],"collections":["48M3RYJX"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["18dbc34e-c635-3836-af29-819cd6946499"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["18dbc34e-c635-3836-af29-819cd6946499"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-09T00:17:51Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T23:36:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/P6ZH8DRL","itemID":2036,"attachments":[{"key":"J2SQFI5H","version":435,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"P6ZH8DRL","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["b186b8d96ed1f2b3f2c445f519be9e6f743f578a"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:50:40Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:50:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/J2SQFI5H","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/J2SQFI5H/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2037/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611798,"version":0},"$loki":176},{"itemID":2052,"item":{"key":"7IVU34KV","version":437,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Mindfulness meditation, well-being, and heart rate variability: A preliminary investigation into the impact of intensive vipassana meditation","abstractNote":"Mindfulness meditation has beneficial effects on brain and body, yet the impact of Vipassana, a type of mindfulness meditation, on heart rate variability (HRV) - a psychophysiological marker of mental and physical health - is unknown. We hypothesised increases in measures of well-being and HRV, and decreases in ill-being after training in Vipassana compared to before (time effects), during the meditation task compared to resting baseline (task effects), and a time by task interaction with more pronounced differences between tasks after Vipassana training. HRV (5-minute resting baseline vs. 5-minute meditation) was collected from 36 participants before and after they completed a 10-day intensive Vipassana retreat. Changes in three frequency-domain measures of HRV were analysed using 2 (Time; pre- vs. post-Vipassana). ×. 2 (Task; resting baseline vs. meditation) within subjects ANOVA. These measures were: normalised high-frequency power (HF n.u.), a widely used biomarker of parasympathetic activity; log-transformed high frequency power (ln HF), a measure of RSA and required to interpret normalised HF; and Traube-Hering-Mayer waves (THM), a component of the low frequency spectrum linked to baroreflex outflow. As expected, participants showed significantly increased well-being, and decreased ill-being. ln HF increased overall during meditation compared to resting baseline, while there was a time. *. task interaction for THM. Further testing revealed that pre-Vipassana only ln HF increased during meditation (vs. resting baseline), consistent with a change in respiration. Post-Vipassana, the meditation task increased HF n.u. and decreased THM compared to resting baseline, suggesting post-Vipassana task-related changes are characterised by a decrease in absolute LF power, not parasympathetic-mediated increases in HF power. Such baroreflex changes are classically associated with attentional load, and our results are interpreted in light of the concept of 'flow' - a state of positive and full immersion in an activity. These results are also consistent with changes in normalised HRV reported in other meditation studies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","date":"2013-09","extra":"PMID: 23797150\nCitation Key:

We aimed to assess the association of adiponectin-related genetic variants resulting from GWAS in East Asians (loci in/near CDH13, ADIPOQ, WDR11FGF, CMIP and PEPD) with LVMI, and to examine whether sleep duration modified these genetic associations in youth. The 559 subjects aged 15–28 years were recruited from the Beijing Child and Adolescent Metabolic Syndrome study. Among the six loci, CDH13 rs4783244 was significantly correlated with adiponectin levels (p = 8.07 × 10−7). The adiponectin-rising allele in rs4783244 locus was significantly associated with decreased LVMI (p = 6.99 × 10−4) after adjusting for classical cardiovascular risk factors, and further for adiponectin levels, while no significant association was found between the other loci and LVMI. Moreover, we observed a significant interaction effect between rs4783244 and sleep duration (p =.005) for LVMI; the genetic association was more evident in long sleep duration while lost in short sleep duration. Similar interaction was found in the subgroup analysis using longitudinal data (p =.025 for interaction). In this young Chinese population, CDH13 rs4783244 represents a key locus for cardiac structure, and confers stronger cardio-protection in longer sleep duration when contrasted with short sleep duration.","date":"2018-06-01","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29903569","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 29903569\nPublisher: Elsevier\nCitation Key: Li2018","volume":"32","pages":"164-171","publicationTitle":"EBioMedicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.05.033","ISSN":"23523964","creators":[{"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Feng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Junling","lastName":"Fu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lanwen","lastName":"Han","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lujiao","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Struan F.A.","lastName":"Grant","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mingyao","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Adiponectin","type":1},{"tag":"Adiponectin-associated locus","type":1},{"tag":"CDH13","type":1},{"tag":"Left ventricular mass index","type":1},{"tag":"Sleep time","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["a329d8fc-506f-42de-bcef-6f7486681354"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["f75ea477-8f18-3786-9ade-90397be63c20"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:03Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/5BNQ84RU","itemID":1382,"attachments":[{"key":"35JYE63R","version":371,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6020797","parentItem":"5BNQ84RU","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:03Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/35JYE63R"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611802,"version":0},"$loki":181},{"itemID":1384,"item":{"key":"FFTK8HVF","version":371,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Associations between polymorphisms of the CXCL12 and CNNM2 gene and hypertension risk: A case-control study","abstractNote":"Background: Hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The study found that CXCL12 and CNNM2 gene affects the risk of coronary heart disease, but the relationship with hypertension is unclear. The aim of this research is to explore the association between CXCL12 and CNNM2 gene and hypertension in Chinese Han population. Methods: Genotypes at 11 CHD-relevant SNPs were determined in 350 Hypertension patients and 483 controls in Chinese Han population using χ2test, genetic model analysis and haplotype analysis. Results: In the allele model, CXCL12 rs1065297 “G” allele, CXCL12 rs4948878 “G” allele and CXCL12 rs10793538 “T” allele were associated with decreased risk of hypertension (rs1065297: OR = 0.53, p = 0.005; rs4948878: OR = 0.51, p = 0.004; rs10793538: OR = 0.58, p = 0.005). CNNM2 rs12413409 “A” allele and CNNM2 rs11191514 “T” allele were also associated with reduced risk of hypertension (rs12413409: OR = 0.71, p = 0.003; rs11191514: OR = 0.70, p = 0.002). Further stratified analysis by sex and age found that CXCL12, CNNM2 gene also influence the risk of hypertension. Model analysis found that CXCL12 rs1093538 TA-TT genotype was associated with decreased risk of hypertension in the dominant model (OR = 0.57, p = 0.0015); Log-additive model revealed that rs1065297 and rs4948878 in CXCL12 gene have a potential association with essential hypertension (rs1065297: OR = 0.54, p = 0.005; rs4948878: OR = 0.52, p = 0.0038). For CNNM2 gene, rs12413409 GA-AA genotype and rs11191514 CT-TT genotype was associated with reduced risk of hypertension in the dominant model (rs12413409: OR = 0.64, p = 0.012; rs11191514: OR = 0.63, p = 0.0082).

To identify genetic variants associated with each of the five dimensions of personality we performed a genome-wide association (GWA) scan of 3972 individuals from a genetically isolated population within Sardinia, Italy. On the basis of the analyses of 362 129 single-nucleotide polymorphisms we found several strong signals within or near genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders. They include the association of neuroticism with SNAP25 (rs362584, P=5 x 10(-5)), extraversion with BDNF and two cadherin genes (CDH13 and CDH23; Ps<5 x 10(-5)), openness with CNTNAP2 (rs10251794, P=3 x 10(-5)), agreeableness with CLOCK (rs6832769, P=9 x 10(-6)) and conscientiousness with DYRK1A (rs2835731, P=3 x 10(-5)). Effect sizes were small (less than 1% of variance), and most failed to replicate in the follow-up independent samples (N up to 3903), though the association between agreeableness and CLOCK was supported in two of three replication samples (overall P=2 x 10(-5)). We infer that a large number of loci may influence personality traits and disorders, requiring larger sample sizes for the GWA approach to confidently identify associated genetic variants.","date":"2010-06-28","url":"http://www.nature.com/articles/mp2008113","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 18957941\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group\nCitation Key: Terracciano2010a\nISBN: 1476-5578 (Electronic)\\r1359-4184 (Linking)","volume":"15","pages":"647-656","publicationTitle":"Molecular Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1038/mp.2008.113","issue":"6","ISSN":"13594184","creators":[{"firstName":"A","lastName":"Terracciano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S","lastName":"Sanna","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M","lastName":"Uda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"B","lastName":"Deiana","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G","lastName":"Usala","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"F","lastName":"Busonero","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A","lastName":"Maschio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M","lastName":"Scally","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"N","lastName":"Patriciu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"W.

We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Methods: We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples. Findings: SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers. Interpretation: Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.","date":"2013-04-20","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453885","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 23453885\narXiv: NIHMS150003\nCitation Key: Smoller2013\nISBN: 1474-547X (Electronic)\\r0140-6736 (Linking)","volume":"381","pages":"1371-1379","publicationTitle":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62129-1","issue":"9875","ISSN":"01406736","creators":[{"firstName":"Jordan W.","lastName":"Smoller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Kendler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Craddock","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Phil Hyoun","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin M.","lastName":"Neale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John N.","lastName":"Nurnberger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Ripke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan","lastName":"Santangelo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick S.","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin N.","lastName":"Neale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shaun","lastName":"Purcell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Anney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Buitelaar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Fanous","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephen F.","lastName":"Faraone","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Witte","lastName":"Hoogendijk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Klaus Peter","lastName":"Lesch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Douglas L.","lastName":"Levinson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roy P.","lastName":"Perlis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marcella","lastName":"Rietschel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brien","lastName":"Riley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Edmund","lastName":"Sonuga-Barke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Schachar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas S.","lastName":"Schulze","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anita","lastName":"Thapar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth K.","lastName":"Kendler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jordan S.","lastName":"Smoller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Neale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Perlis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Bender","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Cichon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark D.","lastName":"Daly","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Kelsoe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Lehner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Levinson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mick","lastName":"O'Donovan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Gejman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Sebat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pamela","lastName":"Sklar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Daly","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bernie","lastName":"Devlin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"O'Donovan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["447e6c17-28cc-42da-955e-f00327b73faa"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["08ca825a-0daa-3c88-82a1-77c315571714"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/4X8RTBTA","itemID":1390,"attachments":[{"key":"H5VI5QCK","version":372,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3714010","parentItem":"4X8RTBTA","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/H5VI5QCK"},{"key":"5ND5L3YP","version":371,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673612621291","parentItem":"4X8RTBTA","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/5ND5L3YP"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611805,"version":0},"$loki":186},{"itemID":1393,"item":{"key":"BIWAQBGY","version":372,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Intracellular clusterin interacts with brain isoforms of the bridging integrator 1 and with the microtubule-associated protein Tau in Alzheimer's Disease","abstractNote":"Sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to affect 50% of individuals reaching 85 years of age.

Because CLU has been implicated in brain amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance in mouse models of amyloid deposition, we sought to investigate whether an AD-linked SNP in the CLU gene altered Aβ42 biomarker levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, we found that the CLU rs11136000 SNP modified CSF levels of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in AD patients. We also found that an intracellular form of CLU (iCLU) was upregulated in the brain of Tau overexpressing Tg4510 mice, but not in Tg2576 amyloid mouse model. By overexpressing iCLU and Tau in cell culture systems we discovered that iCLU was a Tau-interacting protein and that iCLU associated with brain-specific isoforms of BIN1, also recently identified as a Tau-binding protein. Through expression analysis of CLU and BIN1 variants, we found that CLU and BIN1 interacted via their coiled-coil motifs. In co-immunoprecipitation studies using human brain tissue, we showed that iCLU and the major BIN1 isoform expressed in neurons were associated with modified Tau species found in AD. Finally, we showed that expression of certain coding CLU variants linked to AD risk led to increased levels of iCLU. Together, our findings suggest that iCLU and BIN1 interaction might impact Tau function in neurons and uncover potential new mechanisms underlying the etiology of Tau pathology in AD.","date":"2014-07-22","url":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103187","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 25051234\nPublisher: Public Library of Science\nCitation Key: Zhou2014\nISBN: 1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)","volume":"9","pages":"e103187","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0103187","issue":"7","ISSN":"19326203","creators":[{"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ikuo","lastName":"Hayashi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jacky","lastName":"Wong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Tugusheva","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John J.","lastName":"Renger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Celina","lastName":"Zerbinatti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jürgen","lastName":"Götz","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["0d3808e7-eea0-4211-9968-171368a4763b"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["b06c8b63-7cf6-3fe3-b469-b802f481e8df"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/BIWAQBGY","itemID":1393,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611806,"version":0},"$loki":187},{"itemID":1394,"item":{"key":"7Q5TSPVJ","version":372,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genome-Wide associations of global electrical heterogeneity ECG phenotype: The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study)","abstractNote":"© 2018 The Authors. Background--ECG global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is associated with sudden cardiac death. We hypothesized that a genomewide association study would identify genetic loci related to GEH. Methods and Results--We tested genotyped and imputed variants in black (N=3057) and white (N=10 769) participants in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study). GEH (QRS-T angle, sum absolute QRST integral, spatial ventricular gradient magnitude, elevation, azimuth) was measured on 12-lead ECGs. Linear regression models were constructed with each GEH variable as an outcome, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, study site, and principal components to account for ancestry. GWAS identified 10 loci that showed genome-wide significant association with GEH in whites or joint ancestry. The strongest signal (rs7301677, near TBX3) was associated with QRS-T angle (white standardized β+0.16 [95% CI 0.13-0.19]; P=1.5×10 -26 ), spatial ventricular gradient elevation (+0.11 [0.08-0.14]; P=2.1×10 -12 ), and spatial ventricular gradient magnitude (-0.12 [95% CI -0.15 to -0.09]; P=5.9×10 -15 ). Altogether, GEH-SNPs explained 1.1% to 1.6% of GEH variance. Loci on chromosomes 4 (near HMCN2), 5 (IGF1R), 11 (11p11.2 region cluster), and 7 (near ACTB) are novel ECG phenotype-associated loci. Several loci significantly associated with gene expression in the left ventricle (HMCN2 locus-with HMCN2; IGF1R locus-with IGF1R), and atria (RP11-481J2.2 locus-with expression of a long non-coding RNA and NDRG4). Conclusions--We identified 10 genetic loci associated with ECG GEH. Replication of GEH GWAS findings in independent cohorts is warranted. Further studies of GEH-loci may uncover mechanisms of arrhythmogenic remodeling in response to cardiovascular risk factors.","date":"2018","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29622589","accessDate":"2019-09-26","extra":"PMID: 29622589\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell\nCitation Key: Tereshchenko2018","volume":"7","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.117.008160","issue":"8","ISSN":"20479980","creators":[{"firstName":"Larisa G","lastName":"Tereshchenko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nona","lastName":"Sotoodehnia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Colleen M","lastName":"Sitlani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Foram N","lastName":"Ashar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muammar","lastName":"Kabir","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mary L","lastName":"Biggs","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael P","lastName":"Morley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan W","lastName":"Waks","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elsayed Z","lastName":"Soliman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alfred E","lastName":"Buxton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tor","lastName":"Biering-Sørensen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Scott D","lastName":"Solomon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wendy S","lastName":"Post","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas P","lastName":"Cappola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David S","lastName":"Siscovick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dan E","lastName":"Arking","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Electrocardiography","type":1},{"tag":"ECG","type":1},{"tag":"Genome wide association study","type":1},{"tag":"Global electrical heterogeneity","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial ventricular gradient","type":1},{"tag":"Sum absolute QRST integral","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["77baa780-27b5-44bf-841b-d717b7e046e6"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["c65d7ed5-190f-3821-ac2e-d9928a25d042"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-23T15:17:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/7Q5TSPVJ","itemID":1394,"attachments":[{"key":"CMFIJQ6Y","version":372,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6015433","parentItem":"7Q5TSPVJ","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-23T15:17:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/CMFIJQ6Y"},{"key":"NJ68XBGH","version":372,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"7Q5TSPVJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2018 - Tereshchenko et al. - Genome-Wide associations of global electrical heterogeneity ECG phenotype The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["101ef2a053b803b38ab09136e6777e258f5b12d9"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:45:10Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:45:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/NJ68XBGH","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/NJ68XBGH/2018 - Tereshchenko et al. - Genome-Wide associations of global electrical heterogeneity ECG phenotype The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1396/2018 - Tereshchenko et al. - Genome-Wide associations of global electrical heterogeneity ECG phenotype The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611807,"version":0},"$loki":188},{"itemID":1397,"item":{"key":"MH7C9JZ2","version":372,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Coordinated Proliferation and Differentiation of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Progenitor Cells Depend on Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Regulation by GREMLIN 2","abstractNote":"Heart development depends on coordinated proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), but how the two processes are synchronized is not well understood. Here, we show that the secreted Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonist GREMLIN 2 (GREM2) is induced in CPCs shortly after cardiac mesoderm specification during differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. GREM2 expression follows cardiac lineage differentiation independently of the differentiation method used, or the origin of the pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that GREM2 is linked to cardiogenesis. Addition of GREM2 protein strongly increases cardiomyocyte output compared to established procardiogenic differentiation methods. Our data show that inhibition of canonical BMP signaling by GREM2 is necessary to promote proliferation of CPCs. However, canonical BMP signaling inhibition alone is not sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation, which depends on subsequent JNK pathway activation specifically by GREM2. These findings may have broader implications in the design of approaches to orchestrate growth and differentiation of pluripotent stem cell-derived lineages that depend on precise regulation of BMP signaling.","date":"2017-05-01","url":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/scd.2016.0226","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 28125926\nPublisher: Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA\nCitation Key: Bylund2017\nISBN: 1557-8534 (Electronic)\\r1547-3287 (Linking)","volume":"26","pages":"678-693","publicationTitle":"Stem Cells and Development","DOI":"10.1089/scd.2016.0226","issue":"9","ISSN":"1547-3287","creators":[{"firstName":"Jeffery B.","lastName":"Bylund","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Linh T.","lastName":"Trinh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cassandra P.","lastName":"Awgulewitsch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David T.","lastName":"Paik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Jetter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rajneesh","lastName":"Jha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristof","lastName":"Nolan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chunhui","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas B.","lastName":"Thompson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Timothy J.","lastName":"Kamp","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Antonis K.","lastName":"Hatzopoulos","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"BMP signaling","type":1},{"tag":"cardiomyocyte differentiation","type":1},{"tag":"GREMLIN 2","type":1},{"tag":"human pluripotent stem cells","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["6203e763-a2a2-407e-a579-19eec3d3770f"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["305ad7ec-b8c8-3187-b0ed-1a0f8b6869f2"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/MH7C9JZ2","itemID":1397,"attachments":[{"key":"CZ49P2I3","version":372,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/scd.2016.0226","parentItem":"MH7C9JZ2","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/CZ49P2I3"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611808,"version":0},"$loki":189},{"itemID":1399,"item":{"key":"VAJI4ASQ","version":372,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Cadherin-13 gene is associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder","abstractNote":"Several efforts have been made to find new genetic risk variants which explain the high heritability of ADHD.

The main goal of this study is to test the association between SNPs in CDH13 and CTNNA2 genes and ADHD across the life cycle in subjects with ADHD.

Background: No study has examined the effects of these genetic variants on CHD in diabetic patients. Methods: We genotyped 15 genetic markers of 12 loci in 3 studies of diabetic patients: the prospective Nurses' Health Study (309 CHD cases, and 544 control subjects) and Health Professional Follow-up Study (345 CHD cases, and 451 control subjects) and the cross-sectional Joslin Heart Study (422 CHD cases, and 435 control subjects). Results: Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs4977574 (CDKN2A/2B), rs12526453 (PHACTR1), rs646776 (CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1), rs2259816 (HNF1A), and rs11206510 (PCSK9) showed directionally consistent associations with CHD in the 3 studies, with combined odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.17 to 1.25 (p = 0.03 to 0.0002). None of the other single-nucleotide polymorphisms reached significance in individual or combined analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created by combining the risk alleles of the 5 significantly associated loci. The OR of CHD/GRS unit was 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 1.26; p < 0.0001). Individuals with GRS <8 (19% of diabetic subjects) had almost a 2-fold increase in CHD risk (OR: 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.60 to 2.35) as compared with individuals with GRS ≤5 (30% of diabetic subjects). Prediction of CHD was significantly improved (p < 0.001) when the GRS was added to a model including clinical predictors in the combined samples.

In ventricular cardiomyocytes, the membrane deformation protein cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1 or BIN1+13+17) creates transverse-tubule (t-tubule) membrane microfolds, which facilitate ion channel trafficking and modulate local ionic concentrations. The microfold-generated microdomains continuously reorganize, adapting in response to stress to modulate the calcium signaling apparatus. We explored the possibility that cBIN1-microfolds are externally released from cardiomyocytes. Using electron microscopy imaging with immunogold labeling, we found in mouse plasma that cBIN1 exists in membrane vesicles about 200 nm in size, which is consistent with the size of MPs. In mice with cardiac-specific heterozygous Bin1 deletion, flow cytometry identified 47% less cBIN1-MPs in plasma, supporting cardiac origin. Cardiac release was also evidenced by the detection of cBIN1-MPs in medium bathing a pure population of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. In human plasma, osmotic shock increased cBIN1 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cBIN1 level decreased in humans with heart failure, a condition with reduced cardiac muscle cBIN1, both of which support cBIN1 release in MPs from human hearts. Exploring putative mechanisms of MP release, we found that the membrane fission complex endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B) colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with cBIN1, an interaction enhanced by actin stabilization. In HeLa cells with cBIN1 overexpression, knockdown of CHMP4B reduced the release of cBIN1-MPs. Using truncation mutants, we identified that the N-terminal BAR (N-BAR) domain in cBIN1 is required for CHMP4B binding and MP release. This study links the BAR protein superfamily to the ESCRT pathway for MP biogenesis in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells, identifying elements of a pathway by which cytoplasmic cBIN1 is released into blood.","date":"2017-08-14","url":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002354","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 28806752\nPublisher: Public Library of Science\nCitation Key: Xu2017\nISBN: 1111111111","volume":"15","pages":"e2002354","publicationTitle":"PLoS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.2002354","issue":"8","ISSN":"15457885","creators":[{"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Fu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sosse","lastName":"Agvanian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert C.","lastName":"Wirka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Baum","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robin M.","lastName":"Shaw","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ting Ting","lastName":"Hong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cecilia","lastName":"Lo","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["a981000d-2cbc-4c20-a0c2-dcef55db2624"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["32d50e9d-7c42-36f4-93ed-a2e3e7befbd9"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ZZCKHFVX","itemID":1403,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611811,"version":0},"$loki":192},{"itemID":1404,"item":{"key":"ZFIBSU42","version":373,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genome-Wide association study of a heart failure related metabolomic profile among african americans in the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study","abstractNote":"Both the prevalence and incidence of heart failure (HF) are increasing, especially among African Americans, but no large-scale, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HF-related metabolites has been reported.

GWASs of three metabolites identified previously as risk factors for incident HF (pyroglutamine, dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid, and X-11787, being either hydroxy-leucine or hydroxy-isoleucine) were performed in 1,260 African Americans free of HF at the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.

Further use of metabolomics technology will facilitate replication of these findings in independent samples.","date":"2013-12-01","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/gepi.21752","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 23934736\narXiv: NIHMS150003\nPublisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\nCitation Key: Yu2013\nISBN: 1098-2272 (Electronic)\\r0741-0395 (Linking)","volume":"37","pages":"840-845","publicationTitle":"Genetic Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1002/gepi.21752","issue":"8","ISSN":"07410395","creators":[{"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zheng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Danny","lastName":"Alexander","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Teri A.","lastName":"Manolio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Alonso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jennifer A.","lastName":"Nettleton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Boerwinkle","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heart failure","type":1},{"tag":"Genome-wide association","type":1},{"tag":"African Americans","type":1},{"tag":"Metabolomics","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["17b5b44e-869d-49f4-af83-7ef5345bb039"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["908b2f73-8cb2-3df5-ae00-f08cab9e2fbe"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ZFIBSU42","itemID":1404,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611812,"version":0},"$loki":193},{"itemID":1405,"item":{"key":"S8W3ZYV2","version":373,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genetic variants identified in a European genome-wide association study that were found to predict incident coronary heart disease in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study","abstractNote":"In 2007, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) performed a genome-wide association study in 2,000 British coronary heart disease (CHD) cases and 3,000 controls after genotyping 469,557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Seven variants associated with CHD were initially identified, and 5 SNPs were later found in replication studies. In the current study, the authors aimed to determine whether the 12 SNPs reported by the WTCCC predicted incident CHD through 2004 in a biracial, prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) comprising 15,792 persons aged 45-64 years who had been selected by probability sampling from 4 different US communities in 1987-1989. Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age and gender were used to estimate CHD hazard rate ratios (HRRs) over a 17-year period (1,362 cases in whites and 397 cases in African Americans) under an additive genetic model. The results showed that 3 SNPs in whites (rs599839, rs1333049, and rs501120; HRRs were 1.10 (P = 0.044), 1.14 (P < 0.001), and 1.14 (P = 0.030), respectively) and 1 SNP in African Americans (rs7250581; HRR = 1.60, P = 0.05) were significantly associated with incident CHD. This study demonstrates that genetic variants revealed in a case-control genome-wide association study enriched for early disease onset may play a role in the genetic etiology of CHD in the general population.","date":"2010-01-01","url":"https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/aje/kwp377","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 19955471\nPublisher: Oxford University Press\nCitation Key: Bressler2010\nISBN: 1476-6256 (Electronic) 0002-9262 (Linking)","volume":"171","pages":"14-23","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/aje/kwp377","issue":"1","ISSN":"00029262","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Bressler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aaron R.","lastName":"Folsom","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David J.","lastName":"Couper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kelly A.","lastName":"Volcik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Boerwinkle","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Myocardial infarction","type":1},{"tag":"Coronary disease","type":1},{"tag":"Genetic variation","type":1},{"tag":"Genetics","type":1},{"tag":"Genomics","type":1},{"tag":"Heart diseases","type":1},{"tag":"Polymorphism","type":1},{"tag":"single nucleotide","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["77c793b6-410a-41c7-84d7-daa7def3799f"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["e48a0fa1-fc85-3588-b695-ae78fffc5f28"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-20T22:14:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/S8W3ZYV2","itemID":1405,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611812,"version":0},"$loki":194},{"itemID":1406,"item":{"key":"RPFIZJ6F","version":373,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new susceptibility loci for migraine","abstractNote":"Migraine is the most common brain disorder, affecting approximately 14% of the adult population, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.

localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules","abstractNote":"The BAR domain protein superfamily is involved in membrane invagination and endocytosis, but its role in organizing membrane proteins has not been explored. In particular, the membrane scaffolding protein BIN1 functions to initiate T-tubule genesis in skeletal muscle cells. Constitutive knockdown of BIN1 in mice is perinatal lethal, which is associated with an induced dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the functional role of BIN1 in cardiomyocytes is not known. An important function of cardiac T-tubules is to allow L-type calcium channels (Cav1.2) to be in close proximity to sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors to initiate the intracellular calcium transient. Efficient excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and normal cardiac contractility depend upon Cav1.2 localization to T-tubules. We hypothesized that BIN1 not only exists at cardiac T-tubules, but it also localizes Cav1.2 to these membrane structures. We report that BIN1 localizes to cardiac T-tubules and clusters there with Cav1.2. Studies involve freshly acquired human and mouse adult cardiomyocytes using complementary immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy with dual immunogold labeling, and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we use surface biotinylation and live cell confocal and total internal fluorescence microscopy imaging in cardiomyocytes and cell lines to explore delivery of Cav1.2 to BIN1 structures. We find visually and quantitatively that dynamic microtubules are tethered to membrane scaffolded by BIN1, allowing targeted delivery of Cav1.2 from the microtubules to the associated membrane. Since Cav1.2 delivery to BIN1 occurs in reductionist non-myocyte cell lines, we find that other myocyte-specific structures are not essential and there is an intrinsic relationship between microtubule-based Cav1.2 delivery and its BIN1 scaffold. In differentiated mouse cardiomyocytes, knockdown of BIN1 reduces surface Cav1.2 and delays development of the calcium transient, indicating that Cav1.2 targeting to BIN1 is functionally important to cardiac calcium signaling. We have identified that membrane-associated BIN1 not only induces membrane curvature but can direct specific antegrade delivery of microtubule-transported membrane proteins. Furthermore, this paradigm provides a microtubule and BIN1-dependent mechanism of Cav1.2 delivery to T-tubules. This novel Cav1.2 trafficking pathway should serve as an important regulatory aspect of EC coupling, affecting cardiac contractility in mammalian hearts.","date":"2010-02-16","url":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312","accessDate":"2018-12-24","extra":"PMID: 20169111\nPublisher: Public Library of Science\nCitation Key: Hong2010\nISBN: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312","volume":"8","pages":"e1000312","publicationTitle":"PLoS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312","issue":"2","ISSN":"15449173","creators":[{"firstName":"Ting Ting","lastName":"Hong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James W.","lastName":"Smyth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Danchen","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kevin Y.","lastName":"Chu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jacob M.","lastName":"Vogan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tina S.","lastName":"Fong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brian C.","lastName":"Jensen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henry M.","lastName":"Colecraft","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robin M.","lastName":"Shaw","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenneth R.","lastName":"Chien","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["5c98e217-26a6-4907-b1db-d540d29de5dd"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["1bd2a467-639b-32b7-b50f-2e7d9f4f9a4e"]},"dateAdded":"2020-02-20T22:14:04Z","dateModified":"2020-02-23T15:17:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/PW8BWGW8","itemID":1409,"attachments":[{"key":"D93USNMU","version":373,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"PW8BWGW8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2010 - Hong et al. - BIN1 localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["5fe7d2f939eafa60eba905dd3b149e6e7fb2bbb6"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:45:12Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:45:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/D93USNMU","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/D93USNMU/2010 - Hong et al. - BIN1 localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1410/2010 - Hong et al. - BIN1 localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611814,"version":0},"$loki":196},{"itemID":1411,"item":{"key":"RE8IYKRJ","version":373,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genome-wide association scan of trait depression","abstractNote":"Background Independent of temporal circumstances, some individuals have greater susceptibility to depressive affects, such as feelings of guilt, sadness, hopelessness, and loneliness.

Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices. None of the studied genome-wide significant variants had any major effect on cardiovascular or total mortality in patients referred for coronary angiography.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: AGXT2 has an important role in SDMA metabolism in humans.

Methods: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52% women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51% women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10, call rate ≥ 80%, Hardy-Weinberg p-value ≥ 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN). Results: Associations at p < 10-3 were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values < 10-3; lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 × 10-4) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007. Conclusion: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population. © 2007 Newton-Cheh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","date":"2007-09-19","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17903306","accessDate":"2020-03-09","extra":"Citation Key: Newton-Cheh2007a","volume":"8","pages":"S7","publicationTitle":"BMC Medical Genetics","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2350-8-S1-S7","issue":"SUPPL. 1","ISSN":"14712350","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Newton-Cheh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chao Yu","lastName":"Guo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas J.","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christopher J.","lastName":"O, Donnell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Levy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin G.","lastName":"Larson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["1a790a47-b587-3879-9734-fe35e1c49513"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["1a790a47-b587-3879-9734-fe35e1c49513"]},"dateAdded":"2020-03-09T15:17:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-13T04:29:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/TQI688KQ","itemID":1413,"attachments":[{"key":"R2WECVWW","version":374,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1995612","parentItem":"TQI688KQ","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-03-09T15:17:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-13T04:29:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/R2WECVWW"},{"key":"8G4CR3KS","version":609,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"TQI688KQ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["88c952b4662e7f4de014c8fc970bda5e031005ac"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:45:13Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:45:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/8G4CR3KS","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/8G4CR3KS/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1415/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611818,"version":0},"$loki":199},{"itemID":1416,"item":{"key":"S24UH5EX","version":374,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genome-wide association study of heart rate and its variability in Hispanic/Latino cohorts","abstractNote":"Background Although time–domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) are used to estimate cardiac autonomic tone and disease risk in multiethnic populations, the genetic epidemiology of HRV in Hispanics/Latinos has not been characterized. Objective The purpose of this study was to conduct a genome-wide association study of heart rate (HR) and its variability in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Women's Health Initiative Hispanic SNP-Health Association Resource project (n = 13,767). Methods We estimated HR (bpm), standard deviation of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (SDNN, ms), and root mean squared difference in successive, normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (RMSSD, ms) from resting, standard 12-lead ECGs. We estimated associations between each phenotype and 17 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accounting for relatedness and adjusting for age, sex, study site, and ancestry. Cohort-specific estimates were combined using fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analysis. We investigated replication for select SNPs exceeding genome-wide (P <5 × 10–8) or suggestive (P <10–6) significance thresholds. Results Two genome-wide significant SNPs replicated in a European ancestry cohort, 1 one for RMSSD (rs4963772; chromosome 12) and another for SDNN (rs12982903; chromosome 19). A suggestive SNP for HR (rs236352; chromosome 6) replicated in an African-American cohort. Functional annotation of replicated SNPs in cardiac and neuronal tissues identified potentially causal variants and mechanisms. Conclusion This first genome-wide association study of HRV and HR in Hispanics/Latinos underscores the potential for even modestly sized samples of non-European ancestry to inform the genetic epidemiology of complex traits.","date":"2017-11-01","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610988","accessDate":"2020-03-09","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier B.V.\nCitation Key: Kerr2017","volume":"14","pages":"1675-1684","publicationTitle":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.06.018","issue":"11","ISSN":"15563871","creators":[{"firstName":"Kathleen F.","lastName":"Kerr","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christy L.","lastName":"Avery","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henry J.","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura M.","lastName":"Raffield","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qian S.","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brian L.","lastName":"Browning","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sharon R.","lastName":"Browning","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew P.","lastName":"Conomos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephanie M.","lastName":"Gogarten","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cathy C.","lastName":"Laurie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamar","lastName":"Sofer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Timothy A.","lastName":"Thornton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chancellor","lastName":"Hohensee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rebecca D.","lastName":"Jackson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Kooperberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Raúl","lastName":"Méndez-Giráldez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marco V.","lastName":"Perez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ulrike","lastName":"Peters","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander P.","lastName":"Reiner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhu Ming","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nona","lastName":"Sotoodehnia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kent D.","lastName":"Taylor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xiuqing","lastName":"Guo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Leslie A.","lastName":"Lange","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elsayed Z.","lastName":"Soliman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James G.","lastName":"Wilson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jerome I.","lastName":"Rotter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan R.","lastName":"Heckbert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deepti","lastName":"Jain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric A.","lastName":"Whitsel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Epidemiology","type":1},{"tag":"Autonomic nervous system","type":1},{"tag":"Electrocardiogram","type":1},{"tag":"Genetic association studies","type":1},{"tag":"Ion channels/membrane transport","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["a2a6b5ff-6f12-3c46-8cff-5f7c6c215a9d"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["a2a6b5ff-6f12-3c46-8cff-5f7c6c215a9d"]},"dateAdded":"2020-03-09T15:17:33Z","dateModified":"2020-03-11T16:22:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/S24UH5EX","itemID":1416,"attachments":[{"key":"2HSLK3PZ","version":374,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5671896","parentItem":"S24UH5EX","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-03-09T15:17:33Z","dateModified":"2020-03-11T16:22:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/2HSLK3PZ"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611819,"version":0},"$loki":200},{"itemID":1459,"item":{"key":"59V2HGGU","version":378,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Genetic loci associated with heart rate variability and their effects on cardiac disease risk","abstractNote":"Reduced cardiac vagal control reflected in low heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with greater risks for cardiac morbidity and mortality. In two-stage meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for three HRV traits in up to 53,174 individuals of European ancestry, we detect 17 genome-wide significant SNPs in eight loci. HRV SNPs tag non-synonymous SNPs (in NDUFA11 and KIAA1755), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (influencing GNG11, RGS6 and NEO1), or are located in genes preferentially expressed in the sinoatrial node (GNG11, RGS6 and HCN4). Genetic risk scores account for 0.9 to 2.6% of the HRV variance. Significant genetic correlation is found for HRV with heart rate (-0.74<r g <-0.55) and blood pressure (-0.35<r g <-0.20). These findings provide clinically relevant biological insight into heritable variation in vagal heart rhythm regulation, with a key role for genetic variants (GNG11, RGS6) that influence G-protein heterotrimer action in GIRK-channel induced pacemaker membrane hyperpolarization.","date":"2017-06-14","accessDate":"2020-02-10","extra":"PMID: 28613276\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group\nCitation Key: Nolte2017a","volume":"8","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms15805","ISSN":"20411723","creators":[{"firstName":"Ilja M.","lastName":"Nolte","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.

It is one of the largest national twin registries in the US and currently has subjects living in all 50 states. Initially formed to address questions about the long-term health effects of service in Vietnam the Registry has evolved into a resource for genetic epidemiologic studies of mental and physical health conditions. The management and administration of the VET Registry is described with particular attention given to the processes involved with database maintenance and study coordination. Several waves of mail and telephone surveys have collected a wealth of health-related information on Registry twins. More recent data collection efforts have focused on specific sets of twin pairs and conducted detailed clinical or laboratory testing. New Registry initiatives for the future include the construction of a web site and the development of a DNA repository. © 2002 Cambridge University Press.","date":"2002-10-01","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12537880/","accessDate":"2021-03-07","extra":"PMID: 12537880\nPublisher: Twin Res\nCitation Key: Goldberg2002","volume":"5","pages":"476-481","publicationTitle":"Twin Research","DOI":"10.1375/136905202320906318","issue":"5","ISSN":"13690523","creators":[{"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Birute","lastName":"Curran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mary Ellen","lastName":"Vitek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"William G.","lastName":"Henderson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Edward J.","lastName":"Boyko","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Humans","type":1},{"tag":"Male","type":1},{"tag":"Review","type":1},{"tag":"Research Support","type":1},{"tag":"U.S. Gov't","type":1},{"tag":"MEDLINE","type":1},{"tag":"National Center for Biotechnology Information","type":1},{"tag":"National Institutes of Health","type":1},{"tag":"National Library of Medicine","type":1},{"tag":"NCBI","type":1},{"tag":"NIH","type":1},{"tag":"NLM","type":1},{"tag":"PubMed Abstract","type":1},{"tag":"Non-P.H.S.","type":1},{"tag":"Birute Curran","type":1},{"tag":"Data Collection","type":1},{"tag":"Databases","type":1},{"tag":"Diseases in Twins / epidemiology*","type":1},{"tag":"Diseases in Twins / genetics*","type":1},{"tag":"doi:10.1375/136905202320906318","type":1},{"tag":"Edward J Boyko","type":1},{"tag":"Factual / statistics & numerical data","type":1},{"tag":"Health Status","type":1},{"tag":"Health Surveys","type":1},{"tag":"Jack Goldberg","type":1},{"tag":"Molecular Epidemiology","type":1},{"tag":"pmid:12537880","type":1},{"tag":"Registries* / statistics & numerical data","type":1},{"tag":"Surveys and Questionnaires","type":1},{"tag":"Twin Studies as Topic / methods*","type":1},{"tag":"Twin Studies as Topic / statistics & numerical dat","type":1},{"tag":"Twins* / genetics","type":1},{"tag":"Twins* / psychology","type":1},{"tag":"Twins* / statistics & numerical data","type":1},{"tag":"United States / epidemiology","type":1},{"tag":"Veterans* / psychology","type":1},{"tag":"Veterans* / statistics & numerical data","type":1},{"tag":"Vietnam","type":1},{"tag":"Warfare","type":1}],"collections":["MRHZHMA4"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["903178da-9bb7-30c6-8c92-06a003b9361b"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["903178da-9bb7-30c6-8c92-06a003b9361b"]},"dateAdded":"2021-03-08T04:07:29Z","dateModified":"2021-03-09T00:40:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/HU9PVQKJ","itemID":1763,"attachments":[{"key":"2H789XRJ","version":463,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"HU9PVQKJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["bec3bebe935a8ff62c297218e8b5184446f82615"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:47Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:47:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/2H789XRJ","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/2H789XRJ/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1764/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611821,"version":0},"$loki":202},{"itemID":2021,"item":{"key":"VCIQ4N84","version":434,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Cells of the adult human heart","abstractNote":"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require a deeper understanding of the molecular processes involved in the healthy heart. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle. Our human cardiac cell atlas improves our understanding of the human heart and provides a valuable reference for future studies.","date":"2020-12-17","url":"/pmc/articles/PMC7681775/","accessDate":"2022-10-03","extra":"PMID: 32971526\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group\nCitation Key: Litvinukova2020","volume":"588","pages":"466-472","publicationTitle":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2797-4","issue":"7838","ISSN":"14764687","creators":[{"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Litviňuková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Talavera-López","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henrike","lastName":"Maatz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Reichart","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Catherine L.","lastName":"Worth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric L.","lastName":"Lindberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Kanda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Polanski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Heinig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emily R.","lastName":"Nadelmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenny","lastName":"Roberts","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Liz","lastName":"Tuck","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eirini S.","lastName":"Fasouli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel M.","lastName":"DeLaughter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"McDonough","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hiroko","lastName":"Wakimoto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshua M.","lastName":"Gorham","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Samari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krishnaa T.","lastName":"Mahbubani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kourosh","lastName":"Saeb-Parsy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giannino","lastName":"Patone","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joseph J.","lastName":"Boyle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anissa","lastName":"Viveiros","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gavin Y.","lastName":"Oudit","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Omer Ali","lastName":"Bayraktar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

The neuropeptide Y system is one of the best-known modulators of the stress response, and some of its effects are mediated through the neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R). The functional NPY2R variant rs6857715 (C-599T) has been implicated in both obesity and AD, but with opposing alleles. The present study explored whether rs6857715 is also associated with MDD. Analysis of the overall sample (595 MDD cases; 1295 controls) showed an association with the AD risk allele C [P=0.020, odds ratio (OR) (C-allele)=1.18]. The association remained significant after excluding MDD patients with AD/alcohol abuse [P=0.038, OR (C-allele)=1.18]; increased weight/appetite [P=0.006, OR (C-allele)=1.23]; or both [P=0.008, OR (Callele)= 1.25].

Here we report that variants in genes for galanin (GAL) and its receptors (GALR1, GALR2, GALR3), despite their disparate genomic loci, conferred increased risk of depression and anxiety in people who experienced childhood adversity or recent negative life events in a European white population cohort totaling 2,361 from Manchester, United Kingdom and Budapest, Hungary. Bayesian multivariate analysis revealed a greater relevance of galanin system genes in highly stressed subjects compared with subjects with moderate or low life stress. Using the same method, the effect of the galanin system genes was stronger than the effect of the well-studied 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). Conventional multivariate analysis using general linear models demonstrated that interaction of galanin system genes with life stressors explained more variance (1.7%, P = 0.005) than the life stress-only model. This effect replicated in independent analysis of the Manchester and Budapest subpopulations, and in males and females. The results suggest that the galanin pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in humans by increasing the vulnerability to early and recent psychosocial stress. Correcting abnormal galanin function in depression could prove to be a novel target for drug development. The findings further emphasize the importance of modeling environmental interaction in finding new genes for depression.","date":"2014-04-22","extra":"PMID: 24706871\nPublisher: National Academy of Sciences\nCitation Key: Juhasz2014","volume":"111","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1403649111","issue":"16","ISSN":"10916490","creators":[{"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Juhasz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabor","lastName":"Hullam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nora","lastName":"Eszlari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xenia","lastName":"Gonda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Antal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ian Muir","lastName":"Anderson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tomas G.M.","lastName":"Hökfelt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women with stable CHD are more likely than their male peers to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 686 patients (191 women) with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients underwent (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and with both mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress testing. We compared quantitative (by automated software) and visual parameters of inducible ischemia between women and men and assessed age as an effect modifier. Women had a more-adverse psychosocial profile than men whereas there were few differences in medical history and CHD risk factors. Both quantitative and visual indicators of ischemia with mental stress were disproportionally larger in younger women. For each 10 years of decreasing age, the total reversibility severity score with mental stress was 9.6 incremental points higher (interaction, P<0.001) and the incidence of MSIMI was 82.6% higher (interaction, P=0.004) in women than in men. Incidence of MSIMI in women ≤50 years was almost 4-fold higher than in men of similar age and older patients. These results persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and medical risk factors, psychosocial factors, and medications. There were no significant sex differences in inducible ischemia with conventional stress. CONCLUSIONS Young women with stable CHD are susceptible to MSIMI, which could play a role in the prognosis of this group.","date":"2016","accessDate":"2018-10-17","extra":"PMID: 27559072\nCitation Key: Vaccarino2016a","volume":"5","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.116.003630","issue":"9","ISSN":"20479980","creators":[{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kobina","lastName":"Wilmot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibhar Al","lastName":"Mheid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernest V","lastName":"Garcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Nye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ward","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kutner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Long","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Douglas Bremner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Esteves","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Raggi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arshed A","lastName":"Quyyumi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"done"},{"tag":"Sex differences","type":1},{"tag":"Ischemia","type":1},{"tag":"Ischemic heart disease","type":1},{"tag":"Stress","type":1},{"tag":"Women","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["10a94d88-ff25-4c86-b299-dc6b3c623390"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["acca8630-d64f-39b4-b126-bdfb092abfb7"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:46Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:50:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/KUAFKY9L","itemID":937,"attachments":[{"key":"NIXVJXNR","version":326,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","url":"https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.library.emory.edu/pmc/articles/PMC5079026/pdf/JAH3-5-e003630.pdf","parentItem":"KUAFKY9L","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"m-api-2896729a-5be2-a715-39c8-e3e6b9a413d5.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["21ee86174f6b5203fdbde1013093ff6e734de840"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:42:30Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:42:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/NIXVJXNR","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/NIXVJXNR/m-api-2896729a-5be2-a715-39c8-e3e6b9a413d5.pdf","defaultPath":"files/938/m-api-2896729a-5be2-a715-39c8-e3e6b9a413d5.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611825,"version":0},"$loki":206},{"itemID":939,"item":{"key":"WL59WXVK","version":326,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sympathoneural and adrenomedullary responses to mental stress","abstractNote":"This concept-based review provides historical perspectives and updates about sympathetic noradrenergic and sympathetic adrenergic responses to mental stress.

Significant interaction effects were observed with more pronounced increases in mean HR (TSST) and LFHF-ratio (DEX–CRH) in the healthy control participants. No significant main effects of group were observed. Overall, our results indicate ‘‘normal’’ HRV parameters in patients with PD. The HRV of PD patients is no worse than that of healthy control participants since the HRV profiles were similar between the study groups.

However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P < 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58% in patients versus 52% in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22% in patients versus 27% in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P < 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P < 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14% +/- 17%) than in healthy volunteers (29% +/- 14%) (P = 0.01). The increase in MBF during mental stress correlated significantly with changes in cardiac work in healthy volunteers (r = 0.77; P < 0.001) but not in patients. CONCLUSION Despite similar increases in cardiac work and comparable sympathetic stimulation in CAD patients and healthy volunteers, CAD patients exhibit an attenuated blood flow response to mental stress that may contribute to mental stress-induced ischemic episodes in daily life.","date":"2000-01","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10647599","accessDate":"2018-12-01","extra":"PMID: 10647599\nCitation Key: Schoder2000a","volume":"41","pages":"11-6","publicationTitle":"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","issue":"1","ISSN":"0161-5505","creators":[{"firstName":"H","lastName":"Schöder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"D H","lastName":"Silverman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"R","lastName":"Campisi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H","lastName":"Karpman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M E","lastName":"Phelps","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H R","lastName":"Schelbert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J","lastName":"Czernin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["60fe16d6-397d-4a49-ad26-5c21a9474dd9"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["3e50852f-a891-3b37-8776-3efd99afd9ac"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:47Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/GFQNCRJ8","itemID":945,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611830,"version":0},"$loki":210},{"itemID":946,"item":{"key":"YIYVU7VJ","version":327,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Chest Pain and Mental Stress–Induced Myocardial Ischemia: Sex Differences","abstractNote":"Background: Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia is a frequent phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease. Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37%) reported angina; 112 (12%) developed mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29%) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (19% vs 10%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11% vs 11%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.","date":"2018-05","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29224740","accessDate":"2018-11-25","extra":"PMID: 8943244\nCitation Key: Pimple2018\nISBN: 0021-9258 (Print)\\r0021-9258 (Linking)","volume":"131","pages":"540-547.e1","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjmed.2017.11.026","issue":"5","ISSN":"15557162","creators":[{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kobina","lastName":"Wilmot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibhar","lastName":"Al Mheid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleksiy","lastName":"Levantsevych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samaah","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernest V.","lastName":"Garcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Nye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ward","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Puja","lastName":"Mehta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Raggi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p <.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p <.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.","date":"2018","extra":"Citation Key: Bremner2018\nISBN: 0000000000000","volume":"80","pages":"515-525","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0000000000000597","issue":"6","ISSN":"15347796","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia. Methods: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients. Results: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 ± 9 years, 76% male), 99 (16.3%) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p <0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI. Results in the replication sample were similar. Conclusion: Mental stress is associated with acute increases in several inflammatory markers. However, neither the baseline inflammatory status nor the magnitude of the inflammatory response to mental stress over 90 min were significantly associated with MSIMI.","date":"2018-02-01","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159117304579","accessDate":"2018-12-16","extra":"PMID: 28986223\nPublisher: Academic Press\nCitation Key: Hammadah2018a","volume":"68","pages":"90-97","publicationTitle":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2017.10.004","ISSN":"10902139","creators":[{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samaah","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brad","lastName":"Pearce","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibhar","lastName":"Al Mheid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kobina","lastName":"Wilmot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman Samman","lastName":"Tahhan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wesley T.","lastName":"O'Neal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Malik","lastName":"Obideen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Alkhoder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Naser","lastName":"Abdelhadi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Heval","lastName":"Mohamed Kelli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohamad Mazen","lastName":"Ghafeer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Sandesara","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kareem Mohammed","lastName":"Hosny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ward","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yi An","lastName":"Ko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan V.","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Weng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kutner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

We sought to examine whether mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI), but not exercise-induced ischemia, is more common in young women with previous myocardial infarction (MI) than in men.\\n\\nMETHODS: We studied 98 post-MI patients (49 women and 49 men) aged 38 to 60 years. Women and men were matched for age, MI type, and months since MI. Patients underwent technetium-99m sestamibi perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Perfusion defect scores were obtained with observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify ischemia under both stress conditions.\\n\\nRESULTS: Women 50 years or younger, but not older women, showed a more adverse psychosocial profile than did age-matched men but did not differ for conventional risk factors and tended to have less angiographic coronary artery disease. Compared with age-matched men, women 50 years or younger exhibited a higher SDS with mental stress (3.1 versus 1.5, p = .029) and had twice the rate of MSIMI (SDS ≥ 3; 52% versus 25%), whereas ischemia with physical stress did not differ (36% versus 25%). In older patients, there were no sex differences in MSIMI.

These sex differences are not observed in post-MI patients who are older than 50 years.","date":"2014-04","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608039","accessDate":"2018-11-25","extra":"PMID: 24608039\nCitation Key: Vaccarino2014\nISBN: 0000000000000","volume":"76","pages":"171-180","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0000000000000045","issue":"3","ISSN":"15347796","creators":[{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cherie","lastName":"Rooks","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ijeoma","lastName":"Ibeanu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathon A.","lastName":"Nye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amy","lastName":"Salerno","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"D'Marco","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Karohl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James Douglas","lastName":"Bremner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Raggi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cardiovascular diseases","type":1},{"tag":"Ischemia","type":1},{"tag":"Stress","type":1},{"tag":"Sex","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["03e3372a-d321-45e0-a325-00808d81bab5"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["05af2bb4-ce30-3a97-8398-5f6f5ccc050e"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:47Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/9WGR2U3F","itemID":953,"attachments":[{"key":"FGNYXH7I","version":327,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4008686","parentItem":"9WGR2U3F","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:47Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/FGNYXH7I"},{"key":"GZG98U8R","version":327,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-201404000-00007","parentItem":"9WGR2U3F","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:47Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/GZG98U8R"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611835,"version":0},"$loki":214},{"itemID":956,"item":{"key":"FZ9C6T9R","version":328,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Meta-analysis of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia and subsequent cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease","abstractNote":"Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether this is a uniform finding across different studies has not been described. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the association between MSIMI and adverse outcome events in patients with stable CAD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of <200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85% male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0%, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. Methods: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [99mTc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50% were female and 60% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.","date":"2016-03","url":"http://heart.bmj.com/","accessDate":"2018-12-17","extra":"PMID: 25727240\narXiv: 15334406\nPublisher: Springer International Publishing\nCitation Key: Arri2016\nPlace: Cham\nISBN: 9783319324807","volume":"102","pages":"472-480","publicationTitle":"Heart","DOI":"10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307306","issue":"6","ISSN":"1355-6037","creators":[{"firstName":"S S","lastName":"Arri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M","lastName":"Ryan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S R","lastName":"Redwood","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M S","lastName":"Marber","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["1cad77df-b6b0-4eb6-84fb-ed80dcba240f"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["362fdd6d-d056-3ee7-97cf-890f00fa05fc"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:50:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/3DFA7H7D","itemID":958,"attachments":[{"key":"ZZBBXV95","version":328,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-32480-7_8","parentItem":"3DFA7H7D","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:50:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ZZBBXV95"},{"key":"D2VSIV57","version":328,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://heart.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307306","parentItem":"3DFA7H7D","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:50:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/D2VSIV57"},{"key":"VVUPBR2G","version":328,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"3DFA7H7D","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2016 - Arri et al. - Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["42041f857f620e1ced4c1b6d96cbfbdfccd44a78"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:42:37Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:42:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/VVUPBR2G","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/VVUPBR2G/2016 - Arri et al. - Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia.pdf","defaultPath":"files/961/2016 - Arri et al. - Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611837,"version":0},"$loki":216},{"itemID":962,"item":{"key":"2NT47UIQ","version":328,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The mental stress ischemia prognosis study: Objectives, study design, and prevalence of inducible ischemia","abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but contemporary studies of its prognostic significance and its underlying pathophysiology are limited. METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed CAD in the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent mental stress testing using a standardized public speaking task, and ischemia was detected by Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging. Patients also underwent conventional stress testing for myocardial ischemia (CSIMI) using exercise or pharmacological stress testing. Furthermore, digital microvascular flow, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood sample collections were performed before, during, and after mental stress. Two-year adverse clinical outcomes are being assessed. RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-five patients completed baseline enrollment in the MIPS. Their mean (standard deviation) age was 62.9 (9.1) years, 72% were men, 30% were African American, and 32% had a history myocardial infarction. The prevalence of MSIMI and CSIMI is 16.1% and 34.7%, respectively. A total of 151 patients (22.9%) had only CSIMI, 28 (4.2%) had only MSIMI, and 78 (11.8%) had both MSIMI and CSIMI. Patients with ischemia had a lower ejection fraction and higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those without inducible ischemia (p < .050). The prevalence of obstructive CAD was not statistically different between patients with and without MSIMI (p = .426); in contrast, it was higher in patients with CSIMI (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS The MIPS data will provide useful information to assess the prognostic significance and underlying mechanisms of MSIMI.","date":"2017-04","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28002382","accessDate":"2018-12-16","extra":"PMID: 28002382\nPublisher: NIH Public Access\nCitation Key: Hammadah2017a\nISBN: 0033-3174","volume":"79","pages":"311-317","publicationTitle":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0000000000000442","issue":"3","ISSN":"15347796","creators":[{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibhar","lastName":"Al Mheid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kobina","lastName":"Wilmot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brad","lastName":"Pearce","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernest V","lastName":"Garcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kutner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J Douglas","lastName":"Bremner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Esteves","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Raggi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David S","lastName":"Sheps","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arshed A","lastName":"Quyyumi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Prognosis","type":1},{"tag":"Coronary artery disease","type":1},{"tag":"Mental stress","type":1},{"tag":"Myocardial ischemia","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["cb05208c-10d6-4c0f-b6e3-5e44d7cee091"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["1ec02dac-2fef-35e0-a08b-8ab7eab1d302"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:50:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/2NT47UIQ","itemID":962,"attachments":[{"key":"PVWGQYHU","version":328,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5373992","parentItem":"2NT47UIQ","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:50:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/PVWGQYHU"},{"key":"WQMY4QM8","version":328,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"2NT47UIQ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017 - Hammadah et al. - The mental stress ischemia prognosis study Objectives, study design, and prevalence of inducible ischemia.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["5bd6d1160247bfac1b8009b8a6284d39c4ecaa20"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:42:39Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:42:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WQMY4QM8","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/WQMY4QM8/2017 - Hammadah et al. - The mental stress ischemia prognosis study Objectives, study design, and prevalence of inducible ischemia.pdf","defaultPath":"files/964/2017 - Hammadah et al. - The mental stress ischemia prognosis study Objectives, study design, and prevalence of inducible ischemia.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611838,"version":0},"$loki":217},{"itemID":965,"item":{"key":"MZ9PMI8R","version":328,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Coronary and peripheral vasomotor responses to mental stress","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND Coronary microvascular dysfunction may contribute to myocardial ischemia during mental stress (MS). However, the role of coronary epicardial and microvascular function in regulating coronary blood flow (CBF) responses during MS remains understudied. We hypothesized that coronary vasomotion during MS is dependent on the coronary microvascular endothelial function and will be reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22% (±23%) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9% (-10.5%, -2.6%) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5% (8.1%, 91.3%), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1% [-10.9%, 8.2%], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.","date":"2018","url":"http://jaha.ahajournals.org/content/7/10/e008532/DC1/embed/inline-supplementary-","accessDate":"2018-12-17","extra":"PMID: 29728013\nCitation Key: Hammadah2018b","volume":"7","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.118.008532","issue":"10","ISSN":"20479980","creators":[{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeong Hwan","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibhar","lastName":"Al Mheid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman Samman","lastName":"Tahhan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kobina","lastName":"Wilmot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Alkhoder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Khayata","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Girum","lastName":"Mekonnen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleksiy","lastName":"Levantsevych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yasir","lastName":"Bouchi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Belal","lastName":"Kaseer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fahad","lastName":"Choudhary","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohamad M","lastName":"Gafeer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frank E","lastName":"Corrigan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ward","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kutner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

In patients with coronary artery disease, mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia. However, even the determinants of the physiological myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to mental stress are poorly understood. Twenty-four individuals (12 males/12 females, mean age 49 +/- 13 yr, range 31-74 yr) with a low likelihood for coronary artery disease were studied. Serum catecholamines, cardiac work, and MBF (measured quantitatively with N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography) were assessed. During mental stress (arithmetic calculation) MBF increased significantly from 0.70 +/- 0.14 to 0.92 +/- 0.21 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (P < 0.01). Mental stress caused significant increases (P < 0.01) in serum epinephrine (26 +/- 16 vs. 42 +/- 17 pg/ml), norepinephrine (272 +/- 139 vs. 322 +/- 136 pg/ml), and cardiac work [rate-pressure product (RPP) 8,011 +/- 1,884 vs. 10,416 +/- 2,711]. Stress-induced changes in cardiac work were correlated with changes in MBF (r = 0.72; P < 0.01). Multiple-regression analysis revealed stress-induced changes in the RPP as the only significant (P = 0.0001) predictor for the magnitude of mental stress-induced increases in MBF in healthy individuals. Data from this group of healthy individuals should prove useful to investigate coronary vasomotion in individuals at risk for or with documented coronary artery disease.","date":"2000-02","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10666065","accessDate":"2018-12-01","extra":"PMID: 10666065\nCitation Key: Schoder2000","volume":"278","pages":"H360-H366","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology","DOI":"10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.2.H360","issue":"2","ISSN":"0363-6135","creators":[{"firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Schöder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel H.","lastName":"Silverman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roxana","lastName":"Campisi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James W.","lastName":"Sayre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael E.","lastName":"Phelps","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Heinrich R.","lastName":"Schelbert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Czernin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["58d9b7ec-0f84-49b7-a80c-11797ca7bf44"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["d7518df3-f4f9-3eaf-ab55-f8fd21f9529e"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/LN64NL8M","itemID":967,"attachments":[{"key":"5PX8BWGN","version":329,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.2.H360","parentItem":"LN64NL8M","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/5PX8BWGN"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611840,"version":0},"$loki":219},{"itemID":969,"item":{"key":"U3NC4EQH","version":329,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on immunologic and cardiovascular changes induced by mental stress.","abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.","date":"1994-02-12","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7508828","accessDate":"2018-04-24","extra":"PMID: 7508828\nPublisher: American Heart Association, Inc.\nCitation Key: Benschop1994\nISBN: 0009-7322 (Print)","volume":"89","pages":"762-769","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.89.2.762","issue":"2","ISSN":"0009-7322","creators":[{"firstName":"R J","lastName":"Benschop","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E E","lastName":"Nieuwenhuis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E A","lastName":"Tromp","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G L","lastName":"Godaert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"R E","lastName":"Ballieux","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"L J","lastName":"van Doornen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"acute mental","type":1},{"tag":"cells","type":1},{"tag":"increases in cardiovascular variables","type":1},{"tag":"like","type":1},{"tag":"lymphocytes","type":1},{"tag":"rapid and transient","type":1},{"tag":"stress is accompanied by","type":1},{"tag":"studies have shown that","type":1},{"tag":"w m f any","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["20b376ce-3c0a-497a-b9df-4aebf58ddc20"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["5ebd1b8d-a8ac-383a-9ca8-f3b52bb8f9ac"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/U3NC4EQH","itemID":969,"attachments":[{"key":"Z5ESW4KD","version":329,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"U3NC4EQH","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1994 - Benschop et al. - Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on immunologic and cardiovascular changes induced by mental stress.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["46041739d3214bb3404590cb4ad2d21690bc87de"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:42:41Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:42:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/Z5ESW4KD","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/Z5ESW4KD/1994 - Benschop et al. - Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on immunologic and cardiovascular changes induced by mental stress.pdf","defaultPath":"files/970/1994 - Benschop et al. - Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on immunologic and cardiovascular changes induced by mental stress.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611841,"version":0},"$loki":220},{"itemID":971,"item":{"key":"HKHRPJ3D","version":329,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Angina and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia","abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50% were female and 60% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.","date":"2015-05","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727240","accessDate":"2018-11-25","extra":"PMID: 25727240\narXiv: 15334406\nCitation Key: Pimple2015\nISBN: 0022-3999","volume":"78","pages":"433-437","publicationTitle":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.02.007","issue":"5","ISSN":"00223999","creators":[{"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cherie","lastName":"Rooks","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Douglas Bremner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Nye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ijeoma","lastName":"Ibeanu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Raggi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cancer","type":1},{"tag":"Breast","type":1},{"tag":"Ductal","type":1},{"tag":"Invasive","type":1},{"tag":"Man","type":1},{"tag":"Papillary","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["bafed38a-a901-4173-87d0-d9cc1aa66666"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["6f018c8c-db9f-35d5-b74c-d5e9d87f3898"]},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/HKHRPJ3D","itemID":971,"attachments":[{"key":"66HW7VLG","version":329,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4380582","parentItem":"HKHRPJ3D","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/66HW7VLG"},{"key":"WFATFA9N","version":329,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022399915000422","parentItem":"HKHRPJ3D","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T02:49:48Z","dateModified":"2019-10-19T02:49:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WFATFA9N"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611841,"version":0},"$loki":221},{"itemID":974,"item":{"key":"F63EQ28D","version":329,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Ultra short term analysis of heart rate variability for monitoring mental stress in mobile settings","abstractNote":"Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is commonly used as a quantitative marker depicting the activity of autonomous nervous system (ANS) that may be related to mental stress.

APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios <1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32% (95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23% (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite. Future studies should examine these pathways on long-term outcomes.","date":"2018-02","url":"http://atvb.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1161/ATVBAHA.117.309535/-/DC1.","accessDate":"2018-10-17","extra":"PMID: 29269515\nCitation Key: Sullivan2018a\nISBN: 0000000000000","volume":"38","pages":"473-480","publicationTitle":"Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology","DOI":"10.1161/ATVBAHA.117.309535","issue":"2","ISSN":"15244636","creators":[{"firstName":"Samaah","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibhar","lastName":"Al Mheid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kobina","lastName":"Wilmot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Alkhoder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nino","lastName":"Isakadze","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleksiy","lastName":"Levantsevych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik M.","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kutner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ward","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernest V.","lastName":"Garcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Nye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Puja K.","lastName":"Mehta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tené T.","lastName":"Lewis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.","date":"2018-02-20","url":"http://ahajournals.org","accessDate":"2018-10-17","extra":"PMID: 29459465\nCitation Key: Vaccarino2018","volume":"137","pages":"794-805","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030849","issue":"8","ISSN":"15244539","creators":[{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samaah","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kobina","lastName":"Wilmot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ibhar","lastName":"Al Mheid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lisa","lastName":"Elon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pratik M.","lastName":"Pimple","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernest V.","lastName":"Garcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Nye","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J.","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Alkhoder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleksiy","lastName":"Levantsevych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hawkins","lastName":"Gay","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Malik","lastName":"Obideen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Minxuan","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tené T.","lastName":"Lewis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates basal coronary blood flow in healthy humans and mediates mental stress-induced vasodilation in the forearm. However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 ± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter. Mental stress increased coronary flow by 34 ± 7.0% over the preceding baseline during saline infusion (P < 0.01), and this was reduced to 26 ± 7.0% in the presence of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.625 µmol/min, P < 0.001). Mental stress increased coronary artery diameter by 6.9 ± 3.7% (P = 0.02) and 0.5 ± 2.8% (P = 0.51) in the presence of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline. The response to substance P did not predict the response to mental stress (r(2) = -0.22, P = 0.83). nNOS mediates the human coronary vasodilator response to mental stress, predominantly through actions at the level of coronary resistance vessels.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Acute mental stress induces vasodilation of the coronary microvasculature.

We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P < 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55±0.36 versus 0.76±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.","date":"2013","url":"http://jaha.ahajournals.org/","accessDate":"2019-10-18","extra":"Citation Key: Ramadan2013a","volume":"2","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.113.000321","issue":"5","ISSN":"20479980","creators":[{"firstName":"Ronnie","lastName":"Ramadan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Sheps","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Esteves","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.

Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia (MSIMI) is analogous to exercise stress ischaemia, except that the stimulus is psychological rather than physical. MSIMI has been studied with a number of different imaging techniques and with a range of stressful stimuli. But several investigations have involved small numbers of patients, and the medication status of patients has been variable. This has resulted in diverse findings concerning the prevalence of MSIMI, the conditions in which it is elicited, the type of patients who are most susceptible, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, and its clinical significance. In an effort to clarify these issues, we have conducted a systematic review of studies in which myocardial ischaemic responses have been measured in response to standardized mental stressors in the laboratory and clinic. Relevant articles were identified from searches of PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)between 1980 and 2002. Only articles in English language peer-reviewed publications were examined. We included studies that examined the link between standardized mental stress tests and myocardial ischaemic responses. Studies involving patients with CAD and healthy volunteers or patients without CAD were included. To ensure comprehensive data location, further searches were made for authors published in this field and review articles were used as sources.

Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising such markers. The apparently easy derivation of this measure has popularized its use. As many commercial devices now provide automated measurement of HRV, the cardiologist has been pro- vided with a seemingly simple tool for both research and clinical studies[5].

Although definitions vary, most include both tangible components (e.g., financial assistance and physical aid) and intangible components (e.g., encouragement and guidance). Social support has been implicated in the mediation of stressful life events, recovery from illness, and increased program adherence. There are many inconsistent findings in the literature, however, and it is difficult to resolve discrepancies because measures of social support vary widely from study to study. To guide in the selection of measurement methods for research and applied work, 23 techniques for assessing social support are reviewed and evaluated. Criteria for favorable evaluation included reliability coefficients greater than .8 and documentation of validity. Correlations between various social support and criterion measures are simulated in order to demonstrate the consequences of choosing a measure with low reliability. Scale developers reported reliability data for 19 of the reviewed measures. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from .31 to .98. Test-retest coefficients ranged from .22 to .96. At least some validity documentation was available for 13 of the scales. Discriminant validity evidence, however, is almost universally absent. Despite psychometric weaknesses and variability among the scales, researchers have several instruments available to them.","date":"1988","accessDate":"2019-08-11","extra":"PMID: 3277843\nCitation Key: Heitzmann1988","volume":"7","pages":"75-109","publicationTitle":"Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association","DOI":"10.1037/0278-6133.7.1.75","issue":"1","ISSN":"02786133","creators":[{"firstName":"Carma A","lastName":"Heitzmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert M","lastName":"Kaplan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["84d60c0b-3919-415a-a60e-c0ce1a7383bf"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["41173528-e350-338d-85e9-508bda363280"]},"dateAdded":"2020-03-26T17:40:26Z","dateModified":"2020-03-26T17:40:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/7MSMSF8C","itemID":1471,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611852,"version":0},"$loki":232},{"itemID":1472,"item":{"key":"EN5UCNLF","version":380,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Stress and cardiovascular disease","abstractNote":"The physiological reaction to psychological stress, involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenomedullary axes, is well characterized, but its link to cardiovascular disease risk is not well understood. Epidemiological data show that chronic stress predicts the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Employees who experience work-related stress and individuals who are socially isolated or lonely have an increased risk of a first CHD event. In addition, short-term emotional stress can act as a trigger of cardiac events among individuals with advanced atherosclerosis. A stress-specific coronary syndrome, known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning cardiomyopathy or stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, also exists. Among patients with CHD, acute psychological stress has been shown to induce transient myocardial ischemia and long-term stress can increase the risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality.

Understanding such mechanisms may help formulate prevention strategies. We therefore sought to evaluate potential physiologic effects of psychosocial factors by studying their associations with heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Hypothesis: Higher psychosocial stress levels are associated with lower HRV cross-sectionally in a diverse community sample. Methods: We included ARIC cohort participants with information on psychosocial factors in 1990-1992 into our analysis. Psychosocial factors were assessed using validated instruments, including: 1) vital exhaustion, a somatic manifestation of chronic stress and depression, 2) anger proneness, a personality trait, and 3) perceived social support, a potential buffering factor for stress. Short-term time and frequency domain HRV were measured from a two-minute electrocardiographic recording in 1987-1989. Linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We included 9,332 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 5.7 years, 55% women, and 25% black) in the analysis. Only vital exhaustion was consistently associated with HRV, as per the table, which shows the change in ln(HRV) per point increase in score. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of vital exhaustion was associated with a 13.3% (95% CI, 3.9% - 21.3%) decrease in low frequency HRV in adjusted models. By comparison, each year of added age was associated with a 3.7% (95% CI, 3.1% to 4.2%) decrease in LF HRV. Conclusion: A high level of vital exhaustion was associated with low HRV, while anger proneness and social support were not. The inverse vital exhaustion-HRV association raises concern regarding the somatic manifestations of stress, a potential target for preventive interventions.","date":"2020-03-03","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.P542","accessDate":"2020-03-31","rights":"All rights reserved","extra":"Citation Key: Shah2020a","volume":"141","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.p542","issue":"Suppl_1","ISSN":"0009-7322","creators":[{"firstName":"Anish S","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Alonso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric A","lastName":"Whitsel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elsayed Z","lastName":"Soliman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["c79f9e27-5876-3373-a99c-f92b852c6eb8"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["c79f9e27-5876-3373-a99c-f92b852c6eb8"]},"inPublications":true,"dateAdded":"2020-04-01T02:18:44Z","dateModified":"2020-12-04T02:20:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/GZCW3QPV","itemID":1478,"attachments":[{"key":"AEZJWF7M","version":380,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.P542","parentItem":"GZCW3QPV","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"inPublications":true,"dateAdded":"2020-04-01T02:18:44Z","dateModified":"2020-12-04T02:20:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/AEZJWF7M"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611854,"version":0},"$loki":234},{"itemID":1480,"item":{"key":"4L8QVRYN","version":380,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Psychosocial Factors and Risk of Incident Heart Failure: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis","abstractNote":"Heart failure (HF) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Psychosocial factors have frequently been studied as risk factors for coronary heart disease but not for HF. Methods and Results-We examined the relationship between psychological status and incident HF among 6782 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Anger, anxiety, chronic stress, depressive symptoms, and hostility were measured using validated scales, and physician reviewers adjudicated incident HF events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for relevant demographic, behavioral, and physiological covariates. Interactions by age, race, sex, and self-reported health were examined in exploratory analyses. During a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, 242 participants developed incident HF. There was no association between psychosocial factors and HF hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest quartile: anger=1.14 (0.81-1.60), anxiety=0.74 (0.51-1.07), chronic stress = 1.25 (0.90-1.72), depressive symptoms= 1.19 (0.76-1.85), and hostility = 0.95 (0.62-1.42). In exploratory analysis, among the participants reporting fair/poor health at baseline, those reporting high versus low levels of anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms had 2-fold higher risk of incident HF, but there was no association for those with good/very good/excellent self-reported health. Conclusions-Overall, these psychosocial factors were not significantly associated with incident HF. However, for participants reporting poor health at baseline, there was evidence that anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of HF. Future research with greater statistical power is necessary to replicate these findings and seek explanations.","date":"2016-01-01","accessDate":"2020-03-31","extra":"Publisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins\nCitation Key: Ogilvie2016","volume":"9","publicationTitle":"Circulation: Heart Failure","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002243","issue":"1","ISSN":"19413297","creators":[{"firstName":"Rachel P.","lastName":"Ogilvie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan A.","lastName":"Everson-Rose","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"W.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: 12 681 white and African-American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and two ancillary studies. Methods: Participants provided information on SES and place of residence in childhood and young (30-40 years) and mature (45+) adulthood. Residences were linked to census data for neighbourhood SES information. Multiple imputation (MI) was used for missing data. Linear regression and adjusted geometric means were used to estimate the effects of SES on inflammatory risk marker levels. Results: Graded, statistically significant associations were observed between greater cumulative life-course exposure to low education and social class and elevated levels of fibrinogen and WBC among white participants. Stronger graded, statistically significant associations were observed between low adult education, social class and neighbourhood SES and elevated inflammatory levels. Associations were weaker and less consistent in African-Americans. Covariate adjustment attenuated results but many associations remained strong. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cumulative exposure to adverse SES conditions across the life course and low adult SES are associated with an elevated systemic inflammatory burden in adulthood. Chronic systemic inflammation may be one pathway linking low life-course SES and elevated cardiovascular disease risk.","date":"2008-06","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18477746/","accessDate":"2020-10-15","extra":"PMID: 18477746\nPublisher: J Epidemiol Community Health\nCitation Key: Pollitt2008","volume":"62","pages":"484-491","publicationTitle":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health","DOI":"10.1136/jech.2006.054106","issue":"6","ISSN":"0143005X","creators":[{"firstName":"R.

Humans exposed to aversive or stressful experiences show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in their responses. However, the majority does not develop stress-related psychiatric disorders. The dynamic processes encompassing positive and functional adaptation in the face of significant adversity have been broadly defined as resilience. Traditionally, the assessment of resilience has been confined to self-report measures, both within the general community and putative high-risk populations. Although this approach has value, it is highly susceptible to subjective bias and may not capture the dynamic nature of resilience, as underlying construct. Recognizing the obvious benefits of more objective measures of resilience, research in the field has just started investigating the predictive value of several potential biological markers. This review provides an overview of theoretical views and empirical evidence suggesting that individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of resting cardiac vagal outflow, may underlie different levels of resilience toward the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Following this line of thought, recent studies describing associations between regional brain morphometric characteristics and resting state vagally-mediated HRV are summarized. Existing studies suggest that the structural morphology of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), particularly its cortical thickness, is implicated in the expression of individual differences in HRV. These findings are discussed in light of emerging structural neuroimaging research, linking morphological characteristics of the ACC to psychological traits ascribed to a high-resilient profile and abnormal structural integrity of the ACC to the psychophysiological expression of stress-related mental health consequences. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach integrating brain structural imaging with HRV monitoring could offer novel perspectives about brain-body pathways in resilience and adaptation to psychological stress.","date":"2018-04-06","url":"/pmc/articles/PMC5897537/?report=abstract","accessDate":"2020-11-05","extra":"Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.\nCitation Key: Carnevali2018","volume":"12","pages":"228","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2018.00228","issue":"APR","ISSN":"1662453X","creators":[{"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Carnevali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Koenig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Sgoifo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Ottaviani","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heart rate variability","type":1},{"tag":"Depression","type":1},{"tag":"PTSD","type":1},{"tag":"Stress","type":1},{"tag":"Anterior cingulate cortex","type":1},{"tag":"Cortical thickness","type":1},{"tag":"Resilience","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["d9ac0241-a362-37d1-ab26-e968bf145253"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["d9ac0241-a362-37d1-ab26-e968bf145253"]},"dateAdded":"2020-11-06T01:55:14Z","dateModified":"2020-11-06T02:20:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/GK24YBYX","itemID":1731,"attachments":[{"key":"D4RLXIVK","version":405,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5897537/","parentItem":"GK24YBYX","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-11-06T01:55:14Z","dateModified":"2020-11-06T02:20:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/D4RLXIVK"},{"key":"4LSVFX9P","version":514,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"GK24YBYX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["020755658c1a7f05522917088a7844db675f008c"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:37Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:47:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/4LSVFX9P","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/4LSVFX9P/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1733/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611858,"version":0},"$loki":238},{"itemID":1737,"item":{"key":"IFBAJRNX","version":406,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Touch attenuates infants' physiological reactivity to stress","abstractNote":"Animal studies demonstrate that maternal touch and contact regulate infant stress, and handling during periods of maternal deprivation attenuates the stress response. To measure the effects of touch on infant stress reactivity during simulated maternal deprivation, 53 dyads were tested in two paradigms: still-face (SF) and still-face with maternal touch (SF+T). Maternal and infant cortisol levels were sampled at baseline, reactivity, and recovery and mother's and infant's cardiac vagal tone were measured during the free play, still-face, and reunion episodes of the procedure. Cortisol reactivity was higher among infants in the SF condition and while cortisol decreased at recovery for infants in the SF+T, it further increased for those in the SF. Vagal tone showed a greater suppression when SF was not accompanied by maternal touch. Touch synchrony during free play was associated with higher infant vagal tone, whereas touch myssynchrony - maternal tactile stimulation while the infant gaze averts - correlated with higher maternal and infant cortisol. In humans, as in mammals, the provision of touch during moments of maternal unavailability reduces infants' physiological reactivity to stress. © 2009 The Authors.

Method: A national sample of adults (N = 949) aged 34-84 rated their relationships with spouse, family, and friends at 2 time points 10 years apart. At the second time point, participants completed a biological protocol in which indices of autonomic, hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal axis, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic function were obtained and used to create an AL summary score. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations among 3 aspects of social relationships-social support, social negativity, and frequency of social contact-and AL. Results: Higher levels of spouse negativity, family negativity, friend contact, and network level contact were each associated with higher AL, and higher levels of spouse support were associated with lower AL, independent of age, sociodemographic factors, and health covariates. Tests for age interactions suggested that friend support and network support were each associated with higher AL among older adults, but at younger ages there appeared to be no association between friend support and AL and a negative association between network support and AL. For network negativity, there was a marginal interaction such that network negativity was associated with higher AL among younger adults but there was no association among older adults. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that structural and functional aspects of the social environment are associated with AL, and extend previous work by demonstrating that these associations vary based on the type of relationship assessed and by age.","date":"2014","url":"/pmc/articles/PMC4104264/?report=abstract","accessDate":"2020-11-05","extra":"PMID: 24447186\nPublisher: American Psychological Association Inc.\nCitation Key: Brooks2014","volume":"33","pages":"1373-1381","publicationTitle":"Health Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/a0034528","issue":"11","ISSN":"19307810","creators":[{"firstName":"Kathryn P.","lastName":"Brooks","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tara","lastName":"Gruenewald","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Karlamangla","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peifung","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Koretz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Teresa E.","lastName":"Seeman","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Social support","type":1},{"tag":"Aging","type":1},{"tag":"Allostatic load","type":1},{"tag":"Relationships","type":1},{"tag":"Social negativity","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["de6b7fb9-5c79-3b23-bd8f-5062005c5cb7"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["de6b7fb9-5c79-3b23-bd8f-5062005c5cb7"]},"dateAdded":"2020-11-06T02:27:10Z","dateModified":"2020-11-18T23:29:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/88P8CK35","itemID":1740,"attachments":[{"key":"57WEGTZH","version":406,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4104264/","parentItem":"88P8CK35","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-11-06T02:27:10Z","dateModified":"2020-11-18T23:29:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/57WEGTZH"},{"key":"TSIPJCCQ","version":406,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"88P8CK35","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["0f2680dfd2e2d21ebe9193d2548cb03cd6867549"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:40Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:47:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/TSIPJCCQ","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/TSIPJCCQ/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1742/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611860,"version":0},"$loki":240},{"itemID":1765,"item":{"key":"CI47379U","version":409,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Ischemic, hemodynamic, and neurohormonal responses to mental and exercise stress: Experience from the Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia study (PIMI)","abstractNote":"Background: The pathophysiology of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia, which occurs, at lower heart rates than during physical stress, is not well understood. Methods and Results: The Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study (PIMI) evaluated the physiological and neuroendocrine functioning in unmedicated patients with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ischemia. Hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to bicycle exercise, public speaking, and the Stroop test were measured by radionuclide ventriculography, ECG, and blood pressure and catecholamine monitoring. With mental stress, there were increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance that were correlated with increases in plasma epinephrine. During exercise, systemic vascular resistance fell, and there was no relationship between the hemodynamic changes and epinephrine levels. The fall in ejection fraction was greater with mental stress than exercise. During mental stress, the changes in election fraction were inversely correlated with the changes in systemic vascular resistance. Evidence for myocardial ischemia was present in 92% of patients during bicycle exercise and in 58% of patients during mental stress. Greater increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine occurred with ischemia during exercise, and greater increases in systemic vascular resistance occurred with ischemia during mental stress. Conclusions: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance and a relatively minor increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product compared with ischemia induced by exercise. These hemodynamic responses to mental stress can be mediated by the adrenal secretion of epinephrine. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved are important in the understanding of the etiology of myocardial ischemia and perhaps in the selection of appropriate anti-ischemic therapy.","date":"1996","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8921780/","accessDate":"2021-03-09","extra":"PMID: 8921780\nPublisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins\nCitation Key: DavidGoldberg1996","volume":"94","pages":"2402-2409","publicationTitle":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.cir.94.10.2402","issue":"10","ISSN":"00097322","creators":[{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"David Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lewis C.","lastName":"Becker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Bonsall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jerome D.","lastName":"Cohen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark W.","lastName":"Ketterer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter G.","lastName":"Kaufman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David S.","lastName":"Krantz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kathleen C.","lastName":"Light","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert P.","lastName":"McMahon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Noreuil","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carl J.","lastName":"Pepine","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Raczynski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter H.","lastName":"Stone","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"R.

This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.","date":"2015","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2015.02.012","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier Ltd\nCitation Key: Castaldo2015","volume":"18","pages":"370-377","publicationTitle":"Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","DOI":"10.1016/j.bspc.2015.02.012","ISSN":"17468108","creators":[{"firstName":"R.","lastName":"Castaldo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Melillo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"U.","lastName":"Bracale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Caserta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Triassi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"L.","lastName":"Pecchia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Acute mental stress","type":1},{"tag":"Heart Rate Variability","type":1},{"tag":"Systematic review with meta-analysis","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["1245bc57-71c7-49d4-b9cb-4030de5e154a"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["bce04e6d-d39a-370c-bbf9-036810daa939"]},"dateAdded":"2021-03-15T15:10:46Z","dateModified":"2021-03-15T15:10:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/ST2HXB2V","itemID":1775,"attachments":[{"key":"3QG2AVAA","version":486,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"ST2HXB2V","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2015_Castaldo et al._Acute mental stress assessment via short term HRV analysis in healthy adults A systematic review with meta-analysis.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["bb1853817153af2e35330627149e079b6f06dc43"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:47:53Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:47:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/3QG2AVAA","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/3QG2AVAA/2015_Castaldo et al._Acute mental stress assessment via short term HRV analysis in healthy adults A systematic review with meta-analysis.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1776/2015_Castaldo et al._Acute mental stress assessment via short term HRV analysis in healthy adults A systematic review with meta-analysis.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611861,"version":0},"$loki":242},{"itemID":1911,"item":{"key":"MNLM3W69","version":423,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia with Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease","abstractNote":"Importance: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a recognized phenomenon in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but its clinical significance in the contemporary clinical era has not been investigated. Objective: To compare the association of mental stress-induced or conventional stress-induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020). Exposures: Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure. Results: Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16%) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although these findings may provide insights into mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental stress-induced ischemia has clinical value..","date":"2021-11-09","url":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2785948","accessDate":"2022-01-07","rights":"All rights reserved","extra":"PMID: 34751708\nPublisher: American Medical Association\nCitation Key: Vaccarino2021a","volume":"326","pages":"1818-1828","publicationTitle":"JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2021.17649","issue":"18","ISSN":"15383598","creators":[{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zakaria","lastName":"Almuwaqqat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeong Hwan","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit J.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether excessive digital vasoconstriction during acute mental stress predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred forty-nine patients with stable coronary artery disease (age 63±9, 76% male, 29% black) underwent mental stress testing with a standardized public speaking stressor and followed prospectively for cardiovascular end points. Digital pulse wave amplitude was continuously measured using peripheral artery tonometry (PAT, Itamar Inc). Stress/rest PAT ratio (sPAT) of pulse wave amplitude during mental stress/baseline was calculated and dichotomized by the median value into low and high sPAT ratio groups. Upon 3-year follow-up, Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard ratios were used to examine the association between sPAT ratio and the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and hospitalization for heart failure. The median sPAT ratio was 0.68 (interquartile range, 0.48-0.88), indicating 32% vasoconstriction with mental stress. Men were more likely to have low sPAT ratio than women (odds ratio, 1.79; P=0.007) while those on β-blockers were less likely to have low sPAT ratio (odds ratio, 0.52; P=0.003). After adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and rate-pressure product change during mental stress, those with low sPAT ratio were at significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.12-2.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Greater peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, denoted by a low sPAT ratio, is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.","date":"2019-10-25","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315005","accessDate":"2022-06-10","extra":"PMID: 31550998\nPublisher: NLM (Medline)\nCitation Key: Kim2019","volume":"125","pages":"874-883","publicationTitle":"Circulation research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315005","issue":"10","ISSN":"15244571","creators":[{"firstName":"Jeong Hwan","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zakaria","lastName":"Almuwaqqat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yi An","lastName":"Ko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Lima","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samaah","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"Alkhoder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Abdulbaki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ward","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of exercise-associated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) during and after exercise testing. Methods: We studied 1847 heart failure-free patients who underwent clinical treadmill testing between March 13, 1997, and January 15, 2004, in the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the clinical and exercise test associations of exercise and recovery PVCs. Propensity score-adjusted Cox survival analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of exercise-associated PVCs. Results: Of the 1847 subjects, 850 (46.0%) developed exercise PVCs (median rate, 0.43 per minute) and 620 (33.6%) had recovery PVCs (median rate, 0.60 per minute). Resting PVCs, age, and systolic blood pressure were key predictors of both exercise and recovery PVCs. Whereas exercise PVCs were related to the heart rate increase with exercise, recovery PVCs were related to coronary disease (previous myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or pathological Q waves on resting electrocardiogram) and ST-segment depression. During a 5.4-year mean follow-up, 161 subjects (8.7%) died, and 53 of these deaths (32.9%) were due to cardiovascular causes. Recovery PVCs, but not exercise PVCs, were associated with 71% to 96% greater propensity-adjusted mortality rates (hazard ratio, 1.96 [95% confidence interval, 1.31-2.91] for infrequent PVCs; hazard ratio, 1.71 [95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.73] for frequent PVCs compared with subjects without PVCs), and occurrence of recovery PVCs reclassified 33.2% of subjects with intermediate-risk Duke Treadmill Scores into higher-risk subgroups. Conclusion: In our heart failure-free population, recovery PVCs were associated with increased mortality and augmented established risk markers. ©2008 American Medical Association.

Background: HF is characterized by reduced contractility and impaired BP reactivity. Compared to exercise-induced physiological changes, the effects of mental stress on BP and heart rate in HF are not well understood. Methods: Patients with systolic HF (N= 100, 26% female, mean 65 ± 12 years of age) underwent a structured public speech task, during which BP and heart rate were recorded. Stress-induced BP and heart rate reactivity were categorized as high (>75%), intermediate (25% to 75%), or low (<25%). Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to examine the predictive value of cardiovascular stress responses for mortality (median follow-up= 48.5 months), adjusting for age, implanted devices, and baseline BP and heart rate levels. Results: At follow-up, 31 patients had died (31%). Mortality rates were 2 times higher (hazard ratio [HR]:2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 3.60; p= 0.014) among patients with the lowest diastolic BP responses (mean=-2.4 ± 5.4mmHg) to mental stress than among those patients with an intermediate diastolic BP response (mean= 7.3 ± 2.5mmHg), adjusting for covariates. High diastolic BP reactivity (mean= 16.3 ± 3.4 mmHg) was not related to mortality (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.66). Systolic BP responses showed a similar but nonsignificant association. Multivariate analyses showed that a high heart rate response (>6.3 beats/min) to acute mental stress was associated with a reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.16 to 1.00; p= 0.051) compared to patients with intermediate responses. Conclusions: Low diastolic BP reactivity to mental stress is independently associated with all-cause mortality inpatients with HF. Larger studies need to replicate this finding and examine the role of psychosocial variables.","date":"2015-05-01","url":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016","accessDate":"2022-07-27","extra":"PMID: 25951757\nPublisher: American College of Cardiology FoundationWashington, D.C.\nCitation Key: Kupper2015","volume":"3","pages":"373-382","publicationTitle":"JACC: Heart Failure","DOI":"10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016","issue":"5","ISSN":"22131779","creators":[{"firstName":"Nina","lastName":"Kupper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Denollet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jos","lastName":"Widdershoven","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Willem J.","lastName":"Kop","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heart failure","type":1},{"tag":"Heart rate","type":1},{"tag":"Blood pressure","type":1},{"tag":"Acute mental stress","type":1},{"tag":"Reactivity","type":1}],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["c529e771-aa3c-3291-8899-90efab3c6538"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["c529e771-aa3c-3291-8899-90efab3c6538"]},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T02:39:26Z","dateModified":"2022-07-29T02:53:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/F67B2KT6","itemID":1985,"attachments":[{"key":"BNRL69VY","version":430,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PDF","parentItem":"F67B2KT6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"full-text.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:fileHash":["05bb8494b5793cdbf91e35311884217a31d7b02d"]},"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T13:50:06Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T13:50:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/BNRL69VY","localPath":"/Users/asshah4/projects/zotero/storage/BNRL69VY/full-text.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1986/full-text.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611866,"version":0},"$loki":246},{"itemID":1999,"item":{"key":"SYMLP23N","version":432,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Relation between resting amygdalar activity and cardiovascular events: a longitudinal and cohort study","abstractNote":"Background Emotional stress is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We imaged the amygdala, a brain region involved in stress, to determine whether its resting metabolic activity predicts risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Methods Individuals aged 30 years or older without known cardiovascular disease or active cancer disorders, who underwent 18F-fluorodexoyglucose PET/CT at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2008, were studied longitudinally. Amygdalar activity, bone-marrow activity, and arterial inflammation were assessed with validated methods. In a separate cross-sectional study we analysed the relation between perceived stress, amygdalar activity, arterial inflammation, and C-reactive protein. Image analyses and cardiovascular disease event adjudication were done by mutually blinded researchers. Relations between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events were assessed with Cox models, log-rank tests, and mediation (path) analyses. Findings 293 patients (median age 55 years [IQR 45·0–65·5]) were included in the longitudinal study, 22 of whom had a cardiovascular disease event during median follow-up of 3·7 years (IQR 2·7–4·8). Amygdalar activity was associated with increased bone-marrow activity (r=0·47; p<0·0001), arterial inflammation (r=0·49; p<0·0001), and risk of cardiovascular disease events (standardised hazard ratio 1·59, 95% CI 1·27–1·98; p<0·0001), a finding that remained significant after multivariate adjustments. The association between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events seemed to be mediated by increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation in series. In the separate cross-sectional study of patients who underwent psychometric analysis (n=13), amygdalar activity was significantly associated with arterial inflammation (r=0·70; p=0·0083). Perceived stress was associated with amygdalar activity (r=0·56; p=0·0485), arterial inflammation (r=0·59; p=0·0345), and C-reactive protein (r=0·83; p=0·0210). Interpretation In this first study to link regional brain activity to subsequent cardiovascular disease, amygdalar activity independently and robustly predicted cardiovascular disease events. Amygdalar activity is involved partly via a path that includes increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism through which emotional stressors can lead to cardiovascular disease in human beings.

Objective To determine the association between mental stress-induced impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation as assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation and adverse cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital network between June 2011 and August 2014. A cohort of individuals with stable coronary artery disease were included. Data analysis took place from November 2018 to May 2019. Exposures Study participants were subjected to a laboratory mental stress task (public speaking). Main Outcomes and Measures Flow-mediated vasodilation was measured before and 30 minutes after a public-speaking mental stress task. We examined the association of the rest (prestress), poststress, and δ flow-mediated vasodilation (poststress minus prestress levels) with an adjudicated composite end point of adverse events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina leading to revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, medical history, and depression. Results A total of 569 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [9.3] years; 420 men [73.8%]). Flow-mediated vasodilation decreased from a mean (SD) of 4.8% (3.7%) before mental stress to 3.9% (3.6%) after mental stress (a 23% reduction; P < .001), and 360 participants (63.3%) developed transient endothelial dysfunction (a decrease in flow-mediated vasodilation). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 3.0 (2.9-3.1) years, 74 patients experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event. The presence of transient endothelial dysfunction with mental stress was associated with a 78% increase (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.78 [95% CI, 1.15-2.76]) in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular event. Both the δ flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.03-1.27] for each 1% decline) and poststress flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.24] for each 1% decline) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular event. Risk discrimination statistics demonstrated a significant model improvement after addition of either poststress flow-mediated vasodilation (change in the area under the curve, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.01-0.09]) or prestress plus δ flow-mediated vasodilation (change in the area under the curve, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.00-0.08]) compared with conventional risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, transient endothelial dysfunction with mental stress was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease. Endothelial responses to stress represent a possible mechanism through which psychological stress may affect outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.","date":"2019","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509180","extra":"PMID: 31509180\nCitation Key: Lima2019","volume":"4","pages":"988-996","publicationTitle":"JAMA cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2019.3252","issue":"10","ISSN":"2380-6591","creators":[{"firstName":"Bruno B","lastName":"Lima","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hammadah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeong Hwan","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Uphoff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Shah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleksiy","lastName":"Levantsevych","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zakaria","lastName":"Almuwaqqat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kasra","lastName":"Moazzami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samaah","lastName":"Sullivan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ward","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kutner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yi-An","lastName":"Ko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David S","lastName":"Sheps","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J Douglas","lastName":"Bremner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arshed A","lastName":"Quyyumi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viola","lastName":"Vaccarino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["JSP8KCJT"],"relations":{"mendeleyDB:documentUUID":["ddfcabe3-447e-4bd8-8c72-d1c9bc0e73a0"],"mendeleyDB:remoteDocumentUUID":["d26c5a63-a8e1-3457-8d71-f561a489c7cc"]},"dateAdded":"2022-11-09T00:05:13Z","dateModified":"2022-11-09T00:05:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/EKY2A4D7","itemID":2032,"attachments":[{"key":"WG5KY9WW","version":435,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6739728","parentItem":"EKY2A4D7","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-09T00:05:13Z","dateModified":"2022-11-09T00:05:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/314755/items/WG5KY9WW"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1686511611873,"version":0},"$loki":248}],"idIndex":null,"binaryIndices":{"itemID":{"name":"itemID","dirty":true,"values":[0,1,15,62,58,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,63,16,230,64,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,65,66,155,67,156,157,68,158,2,69,3,4,159,18,160,70,71,161,162,163,164,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,72,165,166,200,73,167,231,232,233,234,235,5,6,59,55,56,57,74,168,60,61,236,169,237,170,238,239,201,240,171,75,241,172,76,173,19,20,21,22,77,242,7,174,17,78,243,79,244,245,80,81,82,83,246,8,9,84,202,175,10,11,12,176,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,13,14,85,86,87,88,89,90,49,50,203,204,177,51,52,53,54]}},"constraints":null,"uniqueNames":[],"transforms":{"Better BibTeX metadata":[{"type":"Better BibTeX metadata","value":{"Zotero":"6.0.26"}}]},"objType":"itemToExportFormat","dirty":true,"cachedIndex":null,"cachedBinaryIndex":null,"cachedData":null,"adaptiveBinaryIndices":false,"transactional":false,"cloneObjects":true,"cloneMethod":"parse-stringify","asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"autoupdate":false,"serializableIndices":true,"disableFreeze":true,"ttl":null,"maxId":248,"DynamicViews":[],"events":{"insert":[],"update":[],"pre-insert":[],"pre-update":[],"close":[],"flushbuffer":[],"error":[],"delete":[null],"warning":[null]},"changes":[],"dirtyIds":[]}
