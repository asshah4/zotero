Lauren K. Truby, MD, Joseph G. Rogers, MD
HIGHLIGHTS  The prevalence of heart failure is increasing as the population ages. As a result of advances
in medical therapy for heart failure, more patients are living longer and with more endstage disease.  The current review focuses on the diagnosis and management of advanced heart failure, including cardiogenic shock, temporary mechanical circulatory support, durable heart failure therapies including left ventricular assist devices and heart transplantation, and palliative care.  Future directions discussed include translational research efforts in myocardial recovery, emerging left ventricular assist device technology, and innovative approaches to postheart transplant care.

ABSTRACT
In broad terms, ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù heart failure describes a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent or progressive symptoms and ventricular dysfunction despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Clinically the deÔ¨Ånition is often dependent upon iterative and integrated clinical assessments to identify patients with worsening status and reliance on speciÔ¨Åc therapies. This review examines current consensus deÔ¨Ånitions, highlights strategies for risk stratiÔ¨Åcation and prognostication, and examines short- and long-term treatment strategies. Lastly, this paper explores future directions of research and development for the Ô¨Åeld. (J Am Coll Cardiol HF 2020;8:523‚Äì36) ¬© 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ADVANCED HEART FAILURE
Heart failure (HF) affects 6.2 million American adults, with an incidence approaching 21 per 1,000 population after the age of 65 years (1). Projections estimate that by 2030, more than 8 million people over the age

of 18 years will be affected by HF (2,3). Estimating the prevalence of advanced HF remains an epidemiological challenge as a result of the relatively low incidence of the condition and the dependence of the deÔ¨Ånition on an evolving series of therapies. Over a decade ago, a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of Olmstead County, Minnesota, suggested

deÔ¨Ånes those with symptoms at rest and with any physical activity. In 2001, the American College of Cardiology and the

American Heart Association developed a new

construct for deÔ¨Åning HF, describing Stage D pa-

tients as those who require specialized interventions

due to refractory symptoms despite maximal medi-

cal therapy (8). The Interagency Registry for Me-

chanically Assisted Circulation (INTERMACS)

classiÔ¨Åcation system was developed to risk stratify

patients with advanced HF to better deÔ¨Åne prog-

nosis and urgency of intervention (9). These 3 clas-

siÔ¨Åcation systems may be used in parallel in order to

more precisely deÔ¨Åne where an individual patient

lies on the spectrum of this progressive disease.

Professional societies have also published consensus

deÔ¨Ånitions to improve the early identiÔ¨Åcation and

treatment of patients that rely on combinations of

symptoms, objective data, and therapeutic in-

terventions (Figure 1) (10, Supplemental Refs. 11,12).

The highly unpredictable clinical course of HF can

challenge even the most experienced clinician to

correctly identify the optimal timing of referral to a HF

specialist. Whereas some HF cases are abrupt and

obvious, others are related to progressive diseases that

evolve subtly over time. The addition of objective

measures of exercise performance, quality of life,

cardiac structure and function, biomarkers and labo-

ratory assessments, and arrhythmia burden are useful

in the ongoing evaluation of patients with chronic HF

and may serve as important adjuncts to obviate the

sense of clinical stability. One particularly helpful

mnemonic that may help identify patients in need of referral to a HF specialist is ‚ÄúINEEDHELP,‚Äù which integrates clinical history, hospitalizations, medication intolerance, in addition to symptoms and end-organ dysfunction (Supplemental Figure 1) (Supplemental Refs. 13,14). Consensus supports the concept of early referral to avoid the debilitation and end-organ dysfunction that accompanies prolonged advanced HF and may preclude candidacy for advanced therapies (Figure 2) (Supplemental Refs. 11,15,16).
CLINICAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH ADVANCED CHRONIC HF
Patients should have a thorough evaluation to exclude reversible causes of HF and ensure treatment with maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy (8). Testing for ischemia in selected patients, surgical or percutaneous management of valvular disease, treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (including high premature ventricular contraction burden), evaluation for other systemic conditions such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, and a trial of abstinence from substance abuse may identify patients whose native cardiac function will sufÔ¨Åciently improve. In addition to renin-angiotensin antagonists, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors are now routinely recommended in patients with chronic NYHA functional class II/III HF symptoms and adequate blood pressure, although their efÔ¨Åcacy and safety have not yet been evaluated in patients with advanced HF (Supplemental Ref. 17). Cardiac resynchronization therapy can also improve symptoms, exercise capacity, reverse remodeling, and ejection fraction in appropriately selected patients (Supplemental Ref. 18). For those with moderate-tosevere secondary mitral regurgitation, transcatheter mitral valve repair appears to improve survival and freedom from HF hospitalizations (Supplemental Ref. 19). Consideration of candidacy for advanced HF therapies is appropriate for those with residual ventricular dysfunction and limiting symptoms despite aggressive attempts at medical, electric, and mechanical optimization. In the absence of obvious contraindications to advanced therapies, the patient should undergo assessment of clinical and hemodynamic stability, systemic perfusion, and end-organ function. Evidence of shock or rapidly progressive renal/hepatic dysfunction should prompt urgent referral to a specialized HF center (Figure 3).
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be the singular most important risk stratiÔ¨Åcation test in patients with advanced HF (Supplemental Ref. 20). The

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) guidelines support transplant evaluation in those with a peak VO2 < 12 ml/kg/min (or <14 ml/kg/ min if beta-blocker intolerant) or <50% predicted value (Supplemental Refs. 21,22). In addition to peak VO2, patients with a ventilatory equivalent of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) >35 have a poor prognosis and should be considered for advanced therapies (Supplemental Ref. 22). Another commonly used metric is the 6-min walk distance: a measure of functional capacity reÔ¨Çective of exercise performance and the patient‚Äôs ability to perform the activities of daily living. The distance walked in 6 min is highly correlated with peak VO2 and its impact on survival (Supplemental Refs. 23,24).
Right heart catheterization is a critical component of the assessment and management of patients in cardiogenic shock (CS) and patients being evaluated for advanced therapies (Supplemental Refs. 25,26). Invasive hemodynamics can be particularly useful to inform decision-making regarding speciÔ¨Åc pharmacotherapy and subsequent durable advanced heart failure therapies by providing the clinician assessment of left- and right-sided cardiac Ô¨Ålling pressure, presence of pulmonary hypertension, cardiac output,

and measures of right ventricular (RV) performance (Supplemental Refs. 27,28). The ability to optimize Ô¨Ålling pressures has been shown to be a powerful predictor of outcomes‚Äîeven to a greater degree than cardiac output alone (Supplemental Ref. 29). In a randomized, controlled trial of an implantable, ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure monitoring device that guided directed medical therapy in patients with NYHA functional class III HF, patients treated with hemodynamic monitoring experienced a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in hospitalization for decompensated HF (hazard ratio: 0.72; p ¬º 0.002, number needed to treat ¬º 8) (Supplemental Ref. 30). Patients in the treatment arm also had signiÔ¨Åcantly lower pulmonary artery pressures, more days outside the hospital, and improvements in quality of life as compared with controls (Supplemental Ref. 31).
RV failure is common in advanced HF and is associated with increased mortality (Supplemental Ref. 32). In particular, RV dysfunction associated with pulmonary hypertension carries a poor prognosis (Supplemental Ref. 33). For those being considered for durable LVAD, pre-implantation RV dysfunction may represent a relative or absolute contraindication, because early post-operative RV

failure is associated with excessive morbidity and mortality (Supplemental Ref. 34). Optimization of right-sided Ô¨Ålling pressures and RV performance is of paramount importance to successful LVAD outcomes. Pulmonary hypertension also represents a possible barrier to cardiac transplantation, with a pulmonary vascular resistance of >3 to 4 Woods units being associated with increased risk of post-transplant mortality (Supplemental Ref. 35). If prohibitive pulmonary hypertension is present, LVAD treatment as bridge to heart transplantation, in combination with pulmonary vasodilators, may normalize medically refractory pulmonary hypertension and

appears to have acceptable post-transplant outcomes (Supplemental Ref. 36).
SHORT-TERM THERAPY FOR CS AND DECOMPENSATED HF
Although disease-modifying medical therapies continue to be the cornerstone of HF treatment, patients with advanced disease and CS may require intravenous or mechanical therapies to stabilize clinical condition and end-organ function. Advanced therapies employed in these cases include vasoactive medication such as inotropes, intravenous

vasodilators, vasopressors, and temporary mechanical circulatory support. Decision making surrounding choice and timing of these therapies often depends on resources available at a given center, patient candidacy for durable support or transplantation, center experience, and patient preference. There has been a recent paradigm shift in the care of patients with CS, with an emphasis being placed on early and aggressive treatment. In an effort to streamline the rapid deployment of the complex medical and surgical care these patients require, many centers have created multidisciplinary ‚Äúshock teams‚Äù to standardize approaches to care in this patient population (Supplemental Refs. 37,38). The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions recently issued a consensus statement that outlines 5 stages of CS varying from Stage A (‚Äúat risk‚Äù) to Stage E (‚Äúextremis‚Äù) as a tool to aid in the timely diagnosis and management of critically ill patients and to facilitate a common language for physicians and surgeons (Figure 4) (Supplemental Ref. 39).

Inotropic therapy and intravenous vasodilators, are mainstays of improving hemodynamics in decompensated HF, and have been studied extensively in clinical trials. Although routine use of inotropes is not recommended, experts agree that inotropic therapy is appropriate and beneÔ¨Åcial in select patients with evidence of end-organ dysfunction and as a bridge to advanced therapies (Supplemental Refs. 11,40‚Äì43). However, in many patients, medical therapy alone is insufÔ¨Åcient to optimize hemodynamics and improve end-organ function. A key role of the ‚Äúshock team‚Äù is to identify the appropriate patients and timing of escalation of support (Figure 5). In these cases, temporary mechanical circulatory support devices may a play a role as a bridge to recovery, bridge to decision, or bridge to heart replacement therapy (Supplemental Ref. 44). The speciÔ¨Åc device chosen largely depends upon the etiology of CS, the patient‚Äôs unique physiology, and the cardiac output augmentation required (Figure 6).

FIGURE 3 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to the Patient With Advanced HF

JACC: HEART FAILURE VOL. 8, NO. 7, 2020 JULY 2020:523‚Äì36

For patients with chronic heart failure, initial investigation should involve identifying and treating reversible causes of cardiomyopathy. Once these have been excluded, or there has been no clinical improvement despite correction of these processes, guideline-directed medical therapy and device therapy should be optimized. Should worsening end-organ function or shock develop, patients should be transferred to a specialized center and evaluated for advanced therapies (Supplemental Ref. 13,15,17‚Äì19). Palliative care should be involved with all patients ill enough to quality for advanced therapies whether or not they are a candidate for ventricular assist device or transplant.

The intra-aortic balloon pump is a percutaneously deployed catheter-based balloon that inÔ¨Çates during diastole and deÔ¨Çates during systole, augmenting coronary perfusion and myocardial oxygen supply while reducing left ventricular afterload (Supplemental Ref. 45). Although its overall contribution to cardiac output is modest, case series and cohort studies suggest beneÔ¨Åt in a broad range of clinical conditions including myocardial infarction, post-cardiotomy shock, and decompensated chronic HF. As a result, it

continues to be a mainstay of therapy in CS (Supplemental Refs. 46‚Äì49). Novel technology and surgical approaches have facilitated expansion of axillary insertion techniques both in hospitalized patients and in the ambulatory setting as a bridge to heart transplantation (Supplemental Refs. 50,51).
The use of catheter-based ventricular assist devices has rapidly expanded as a therapeutic modality in refractory CS. The Impella microaxial Ô¨Çow device (Abiomed, Danvers, Massachusetts) can be

placed percutaneously via arterial vascular access across the aortic valve, where it draws blood from the left ventricular (LV) and ejects into the ascending aorta. In doing so, the device decreases LV preload and myocardial wall stress, reduces myocardial oxygen demand, and increases cardiac output and coronary perfusion. Small, randomized control trials comparing Impella 2.5 to intra-aortic balloon pump support have failed to demonstrate a survival beneÔ¨Åt despite a more favorable hemodynamic proÔ¨Åle (Supplemental Refs. 52,53). As a result, most clinicians use the Impella CP or Impella 5.0 for patients requiring greater hemodynamic support such as those with CS (Supplemental Ref. 44). Complications related to Impella include hemolysis and migration of the cannula resulting in damage to the mitral or aortic valve.
TandemHeart (LivaNova, London, United Kingdom) consists of an inÔ¨Çow cannula inserted in the femoral vein with access to the left atrium via trans-septal puncture, an extracorporeal centrifugal Ô¨Çow pump, and an arterial outÔ¨Çow cannula inserted into the femoral artery. In this conÔ¨Åguration,

TandemHeart directly unloads the LV and provides a cardiac output up to 4 l/min. Due to the technical expertise required to position the device, it cannot be easily deployed at the bedside and carries increased risk of complications relating to cannula migration. Similar to other percutaneous devices, randomized controlled trials have yet to demonstrate a survival beneÔ¨Åt (Supplemental Ref. 54).
Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is capable of providing full cardiopulmonary support and has been increasingly used in refractory CS as bridge to heart replacement therapy, bridge to decision, or bridge to recovery (Supplemental Ref. 55). The general concept underlying VA-ECMO is that venous blood is drained from the right heart, passed through an oxygenator, and returned to the arterial circulation. In this way, both the circulatory and respiratory systems are supported. The 2 most commonly used cannulation strategies are: 1) peripheral cannulation in which a femoral venous cannula is advanced into the right atrium for drainage and a second cannula is inserted in the femoral artery; and 2) central cannulation in

which the venous and arterial cannulae are placed directly in the right atrium and ascending aorta, respectively (Supplemental Ref. 56). The hemodynamic improvements associated with VA-ECMO commonly restore end-organ perfusion. However, VA-ECMO Ô¨Çow delivered retrograde to the aorta increases LV afterload. LV preload may also increase as a result of incomplete capture of venous return. Clinically, this can result in LV distention which manifests as pulmonary edema with worsening oxygenation, increases the risk of LV thrombus formation as a result of stasis in the nonejecting LV, and is associated with lower rates of myocardial recovery (Supplemental Ref. 57). Thus, some centers

attempt to use ‚Äúpartial Ô¨Çow‚Äù VA-ECMO, whereby Ô¨Çow is minimized to sustain blood pressure and end-organ perfusion while inotropic agents are concomitantly administered to ensure ejection of blood from the LV (Supplemental Ref. 58). If LV distention develops, the LV can be unloaded percutaneously with the placement of an Impella or surgically with placement of a vent (Supplemental Ref. 59). Other common complications of VA-ECMO include acute limb ischemia (in the case of peripheral cannulation), stroke, bleeding, and infection.
Once temporary mechanical circulatory support has been deployed, biventricular function should be reassessed with focused echocardiography and

frequent assessment of invasive hemodynamics in order to determine which devices can be safely weaned and which patients should be evaluated for escalation of support.
LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED HF: HEART TRANSPLANTATION
Long-term advanced HF therapies should be considered for patients in whom guideline-directed medical and device therapy has failed to result in sufÔ¨Åcient hemodynamic improvement to ameliorate symptoms or preserve end-organ function. For patients without options for more durable treatments, long-term inotropic therapy may be administered to improve quality of life and symptom burden (Supplemental Ref. 60). Although survival on chronic inotropic support remains poor, it does appear to be improving in the current era with 1year estimated survival now close to 40% (Supplemental Refs. 42,61).
Heart transplantation remains the gold standard therapy for selected patients with demonstrable improvements in quality of life, functional status, and longevity when compared with conventional therapy (Supplemental Refs. 11,22). One-year survival

following cardiac transplantation is now >90% with a median survival of 12.2 years, though patient selection remains a critical component of achieving satisfactory post-transplant outcomes (Figure 7) (Supplemental Refs. 62‚Äì68). The United Network of Organ Sharing recently approved a major revision to the heart allocation policy intended to decrease waitlist mortality, particularly for the sickest candidates, and improve equitable distribution of donor hearts by introducing more granular stratiÔ¨Åcation of patients, broader geographic sharing, mandatory reassessment of high-priority patients, and standardizing deÔ¨Ånitions (Supplemental Ref. 69) (Figure 8). Important features of the new allocation system include higher priority status for temporary mechanical circulatory support and deprioritization of stable outpatients with durable LVADs. The new allocation system has not assigned higher priority to patients with nondilated myopathies including restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy despite suggestion of increased waitlist mortality in this cohort (Supplemental Ref. 70).
Organ scarcity continues to limit the number of transplantations performed annually. In the United States, a recent increase in donor availability has been driven by the opioid epidemic (Supplemental Ref. 71).

In multiple analyses, post-transplant outcomes of these higher-risk donors appear to be comparable to those with other causes of death (Supplemental Ref. 72). With the advent of direct-acting, curative antiviral therapy, numerous transplant programs have also developed protocols to use hearts from hepatitis C (HCV)-positive donors and have reported excellent post-transplant outcomes with elimination of HCV viremia and presumed ‚Äúcure‚Äù (Supplemental Refs. 73,74). Despite early enthusiasm for this approach, questions about cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes (including allograft vasculopathy) remain (Supplemental Ref. 75). Another effort to increase the number of cardiac donors is expansion of organ donation after circulatory death (DCD). The principles of DCD donation involve the declaration of circulatory death followed by a waiting period determined legally and ethically by the country in which the donor is located‚Äîtypically ranging from 2 to 5 min (Supplemental Ref. 76). Since the Ô¨Årst successful DCD heart transplant in 2014, international experience suggests post-transplant outcomes are comparable to traditional donors (Supplemental Refs. 77,78). Ex-vivo perfusion of donor hearts, which maintains the donor heart in a warm and contracting state during transport, has been pivotal in expanding DCD donation and may facilitate safe use of organs that require extended travel times (Supplemental Refs. 79,80).
Although post-transplant survival remains excellent, the complex milieu of ischemia, host immunological recognition of the transplanted organ, systemic infections, medications, and traditional

risk factors for coronary disease limit the true potential of heart transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD)‚Äîacute failure of the allograft to support the circulation in the absence of rejection or other identiÔ¨Åable cause‚Äîcontinues to contribute to early post-transplant mortality (Supplemental Ref. 81). Management of PGD involves prompt intraoperative identiÔ¨Åcation, early institution of VAECMO support, and post-operative titration of immunosuppression, including avoidance of induction therapy in the absence of sensitization, renal failure, or other high-risk features (Supplemental Ref. 81). The majority of PGD patients treated with VA-ECMO are weaned to recovery (Supplemental Ref. 82).
Additional targets for improving post-transplant outcomes include management of both cellular and humoral rejection, personalized immunosuppression, and achieving an optimal balance between the two. Although endomyocardial biopsy remains the standard for detecting rejection in the early posttransplant period, gene expression proÔ¨Åling with Allomap (CareDx, Brisbane, California) and measurement of donor-derived cell-free DNA are being increasingly used to facilitate noninvasive screening for rejection (Supplemental Refs. 83,84). Current ISHLT guidelines support the use of gene expression testing for noninvasive monitoring of rejection for appropriate low-risk patients between 6 months and 5 years after heart transplantation (Supplemental Ref. 85).
Long-term graft survival is also limited by the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV),

a disease of the coronary arteries characterized by widespread Ô¨Åbrointimal hyperplasia affecting up to 75% of patients 3 years post-transplant (Supplemental Ref. 86). The use of intravascular ultrasound as part of routine coronary angiography has increased the sensitivity of screening, with CAV found in almost one-half of patients at 1 year using intravascular ultrasound as compared with 10% to 20% using standard coronary angiography alone (Supplemental Ref. 87). After transplantation, aggressive lipidlowering therapy should be prescribed, with pravastatin in particular shown to improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reduce intimal thickness and CAV, as well as improve survival (Supplemental Ref. 88). Newer antiproliferative agents, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and everolimus, have also been shown to be more efÔ¨Åcacious in the prevention of CAV compared with azathioprine (Supplemental Refs. 89,90).

LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED HEART FAILURE: MECHANICALLY ASSISTED CIRCULATION
The REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive HF) trial was the Ô¨Årst randomized study to describe the beneÔ¨Åts of LVAD support compared with conventional medical therapy in patients with end-stage HF ineligible for heart transplantation (Supplemental Ref. 61). Since the REMATCH trial, LVAD therapy has evolved rapidly, and with each subsequent generation of devices has come improvements in durability, device complications, and survival (Supplemental Ref. 91). As of 2017, over one-half of heart transplant recipients reported in the ISHLT registry had been supported with mechanically assisted circulation (Supplemental Ref. 92).

The most recent device to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for bridge to transplant and DT indications is the HeartMate 3 (Abbott, Chicago, Illinois). This fully magnetically levitated centrifugal pump was engineered to improve hemocompatibility, reduce stasis, and prolong durability. The pump is programmed to generate an artiÔ¨Åcial ‚Äúpulse,‚Äù varying speeds from the set RPM by 2,000 every 2 s to produce changes in Ô¨Çow and pressure in an effort to reduce the risk of pump thrombosis. The HeartMate 3 was compared with the prior generation HeartMate II axial Ô¨Çow pump in the MOMENTUM 3 (Multicenter Study of MagLev Technology in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy with Heartmate 3) study. When assessing the primary endpoint of survival free from disabling stroke or the need to remove or replace the device, the HeartMate 3 was shown to be noninferior to the HeartMate II, with signiÔ¨Åcantly lower rates of device exchange resulting from pump thrombosis. When groups were compared after 2 years of support, 76.9% of patients supported with the HeartMate 3 achieved the primary endpoint as compared with 64.8% of patients with the older-

generation axial Ô¨Çow pump (hazard ratio: 0.84, 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval: 0.78 to 0.91; p < 0.001) (Supplemental Ref. 93). Freedom from hemocompatibility-related events, including nonsurgical bleeding, thromboembolic events, pump thrombosis, and neurologic events, was also superior in HeartMate 3 as compared with the HeartMate II: a result that was particularly prominent in patients <65 years of age at the time of implantation (Supplemental Ref. 94).
Adverse events remain the Achilles heel of LVAD technology. In the MOMENTUM 3 trial, 10% of patients supported with the HeartMate 3 experienced a stroke (7% disabling), 43% experienced episodes of nonsurgical bleeding, 24% experienced a drive-line infection, and 32% exhibited clinical signs of RV failure. These device complications contribute to signiÔ¨Åcant ondevice morbidity and mortality, and may necessitate re-evaluation of patients for transplant candidacy.
In patients ineligible for heart transplantation, use of LVAD as DT continues to grow (Supplemental Ref. 95). In these patients, evaluation of INTERMACS proÔ¨Åles can aid in identifying optimal timing of device implantation. The prospective ROADMAP (Risk Assessment and Comparative Effectiveness of Left Ventricular Assist Device and Medical Management) study evaluated patients with advanced HF who were not treated with inotropes (INTERMACS proÔ¨Åles 4 to 7) and demonstrated superior survival and functional status compared with those medically managed, with the tradeoff of increased adverse events and hospitalizations (Supplemental Refs. 96,97). It is important to remember, however, that no universal guideline exists to inform patient selection for LVAD therapy, and INTERMACS proÔ¨Åles are likely insufÔ¨Åcient to quantify a patient‚Äôs risk alone. Other factors that must be taken into consideration include end-organ function, age, sex, frailty, and need for concomitant procedures (Supplemental Ref. 98). In addition, a thorough and standardized psychosocial evaluation can help to ensure patient satisfaction with LVAD therapy and decrease devicerelated complications (Supplemental Refs. 99,100). Low socioeconomic status alone, should not preclude LVAD candidacy (Supplemental Refs. 101).
Early data from LVAD studies suggest that some patients are capable of achieving partial or complete recovery of LV function during LVAD support (Supplemental Ref. 102). Hypertrophy, beta-receptor sensitivity, collagen metabolism, and cytoskeletal structure all improve with mechanical unloading (Supplemental Refs. 103‚Äì105). Despite these encouraging molecular changes, contemporary studies suggest that <5% of patients with LVAD have their device

explanted for myocardial recovery (Supplemental Ref. 106). Multiple centers have developed individualized recovery protocols to identify patients most likely to beneÔ¨Åt from aggressive LV unloading and neurohormonal blockade to facilitate successful device explant. The weighted I-CARS score, which includes age <50 years, nonischemic etiology, time from cardiac diagnosis <2 years, absence of implantable cardioverter-deÔ¨Åbrillator, creatinine <1.2 mg/dl, and LV end-diastolic dimension <6.5 cm has been shown to effectively risk stratify patients for their probability of myocardial recovery (Supplemental Ref. 107). Ongoing translational research is focusing on the biochemical and molecular pathways responsible for reverse remodeling in an effort to develop more targeted therapeutic agents to facilitate sustained improvement in LV function (Supplemental Ref. 108).
The future of LVAD therapy will likely see a shift toward less invasive implantation strategies (i.e., via lateral thoracotomy approach) as well as adoption of fully implantable devices (i.e., Leviticus FiVAD, Leviticus-Cardio, Petah Tikva, Israel) and remote monitoring capabilities that may improve outcomes, particularly in high-risk individuals (Supplemental Refs. 109,110).
LIVING WITH ADVANCED HF
Although the aforementioned short- and long-term treatment strategies are intended to increase longevity, they do little to ameliorate the symptom burden and psychosocial distress that disproportionately affects patients dying from HF (Supplemental Ref. 111). Patients often have limited insight into the severity of their disease process and expected mortality‚Äîparticularly those who are not candidates for advanced therapies (Supplemental Refs. 112‚Äì114). Although most clinical trials have focused on mortality and rehospitalization, many patients value quality of life and symptom relief over longevity (Figure 9) (Supplemental Ref. 115). As a result, palliative care‚Äîa multidisciplinary approach to assessing and improving quality of life and symptom management‚Äî is being increasingly integrated into standard medical care to improve patient-centered outcomes. A randomized trial of palliative care in advanced HF recently demonstrated signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in quality-of-life metrics, anxiety, and depression as compared with usual care alone (Supplemental Ref. 116). As such, integration of palliative care with conventional medical therapy in patients with advanced HF is recommended by multiple

professional societies. Importantly, palliative care and advanced therapies are not mutually exclusive, but rather should be employed in concert to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients and their families (Supplemental Ref. 117). Palliative care intervention before LVAD implantation or heart transplantation is crucial in helping patients articulate their goals and health states they would Ô¨Ånd unacceptable. In this way, patients and their families can feel empowered to make difÔ¨Åcult decisions to honor their wishes at the end of life. Despite some progress in this area, there remains much work to be done, as only 34% of patients with HF are referred for palliative care in their last month of life, and mean time from referral to death is <2 weeks (Supplemental Ref. 118).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The syndrome of advanced HF remains an epidemiological, clinical, and Ô¨Ånancial challenge for patients, physicians, and policy makers. Recent improvements in advanced therapies have helped more patients live longer, but have substantially increased clinical complexity and cost of care. Although temporary mechanical support has revolutionized the management of CS, the ongoing lack of prospective, randomized controlled trial data limits our understanding of the risks and beneÔ¨Åts of this technology for a given patient. As use of durable support increases, criteria and guidelines for patient selection must be standardized in order to curb costs of care and improve post-implantation outcomes. In transplantation, work to expand the donor pool must continue while we pursue basic and translational research to understand how to improve allograft longevity by preventing and treating PGD and CAV. Personalized approaches to immunosuppression are also needed to maximize graft tolerance and minimize infectious risk. Ongoing research focusing on myocardial recovery is desperately needed, because biochemical pathways capable of reversing, if not preventing, HF would radically change our approach to care. Lastly, we must continue to integrate patientcentered, symptom-based palliative care into our advanced HF paradigm in an effort to help patients with advanced HF not only live longer, but live better.
