Abstract 
Background 
A clinical characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is persistently elevated fear responses to stimuli associated with the traumatic event. The objective herein is to determine whether extinction of fear responses is impaired in PTSD and whether such impairment is related to dysfunctional activation of brain regions known to be involved in fear extinction, viz., amygdala, hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). 
Methods 
 
Sixteen individuals diagnosed with PTSD and 15 trauma-exposed non-PTSD control subjects underwent a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol in a 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Conditioning and extinction training were conducted on day 1. Extinction recall (or extinction memory) test was conducted on day 2 (extinguished conditioned stimuli presented in the absence of shock). Skin conductance response (SCR) was scored throughout the experiment as an index of the conditioned response. 
Results 
 
The SCR data revealed no significant differences between groups during acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear on day 1. On day 2, however, PTSD subjects showed impaired recall of extinction memory. Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed greater amygdala activation in the PTSD group during day 1 extinction learning. During extinction recall, lesser activation in hippocampus and vmPFC and greater activation in dACC were observed in the PTSD group. The magnitude of extinction memory across all subjects was correlated with activation of hippocampus and vmPFC during extinction recall testing. 
Conclusions 
 
These findings support the hypothesis that fear extinction is impaired in PTSD. They further suggest that dysfunctional activation in brain structures that mediate fear extinction learning, and especially its recall, underlie this impairment.

Abstract 
Recent rodent studies suggest that gonadal hormones influence extinction of conditioned fear. Here we investigated sex differences in, and the influence of estradiol and progesterone on, fear extinction in healthy humans. Men and women underwent a two-day paradigm in which fear conditioning and extinction learning took place on day 1 and extinction recall was tested on day 2. Visual cues were used as the conditioned stimuli and a mild electric shock was used as the unconditioned stimulus. Skin conductance was recorded throughout the experiment and used to measure conditioned responses (CRs). Blood samples were obtained from all women to measure estradiol and progesterone levels. We found that higher estradiol during extinction learning enhanced subsequent extinction recall but had no effects on fear acquisition or extinction learning itself. Sex differences were only observed during acquisition, with men exhibiting significantly higher CRs. After dividing women into low- and high-estradiol groups, men showed comparable extinction recall to high-estradiol women, and both of these groups showed higher extinction recall than low-estradiol women. Therefore, sex differences in extinction memory emerged only after taking into account women's estradiol levels. Lower estradiol may impair extinction consolidation in women. These findings could have practical applications in the treatment of anxiety disorders through cognitive and behavioral therapies.

Abstract 
Gonadal hormones modulate fear acquisition, but less is known about the influence of gonadal hormones on fear extinction. We assessed sex differences and the influence of gonadal hormone fluctuations and exogenous manipulations of estrogen and progesterone on acquisition, extinction learning and extinction recall in a 3 day auditory fear conditioning and extinction protocol. Experiments were conducted on males and naturally cycling female rats. Regarding female rats, significant differences in fear extinction were observed between subgroups of females, depending on their phase of the estrous cycle. Extinction that took place during the proestrus (high estrogen/progesterone) phase was more fully consolidated, as evidenced by low freezing during a recall test. This suggests that estrogen and/or progesterone facilitate extinction. In support of this, injection of both estrogen and progesterone prior to extinction learning in female rats during the metestrus phase of the cycle (low estrogen/progesterone) facilitated extinction consolidation, and blockade of estrogen and progesterone receptors during the proestrus phase impaired extinction consolidation. When comparing male to female rats without consideration of the estrous cycle phase, no significant sex differences were observed. When accounting for cycle phase in females, sex differences were observed only during extinction recall. Female rats that underwent extinction during the metestrus phase showed significantly higher freezing during the recall test relative to males. Collectively, these data suggest that gonadal hormones influence extinction behavior possibly by influencing the function of brain regions involved in the consolidation of fear extinction. Moreover, the elevated fear observed in female relative to male rats during extinction recall suggests that gonadal hormones may in part play a role in the higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in women.

Abstract 
Understanding how fears are acquired is an important step in translating basic research to the treatment of fear-related disorders. However, understanding how learned fears are diminished may be even more valuable. We explored the neural mechanisms of fear extinction in humans. Studies of extinction in nonhuman animals have focused on two interconnected brain regions: the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Consistent with animal models suggesting that the amygdala is important for both the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear, amygdala activation was correlated across subjects with the conditioned response in both acquisition and early extinction. Activation in the vmPFC (subgenual anterior cingulate) was primarily linked to the expression of fear learning during a delayed test of extinction, as might have been expected from studies demonstrating this region is critical for the retention of extinction. These results provide evidence that the mechanisms of extinction learning may be preserved across species.

Neurobiology of Learning and Memory , Volume 94, Issue 2, September 2010, Pages 285-291 
 
Abstract 
The establishment of extinction of one-trial avoidance involves the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), two areas that participate in its original consolidation. The posterior parietal (PARIE) and posterior cingulate (CING) cortices also participate in consolidation of this task but their role in extinction has not been explored. Here we study the effect on the extinction of one-trial avoidance in rats of three different drugs infused bilaterally into DH, BLA, PARIE or CING 5 min before the first of four daily unreinforced test sessions: The glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5 (5.0 μg/side),and the inhibitors of calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII), KN-93 (0.3 μg/side), or of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), Rp-cAMPs (0.5 μg/side) hindered extinction when given into DH or BLA. Levels of pPKA and pCaMKII increased in DH after the first extinction trial; in BLA only the CaMKII increase was seen. Thus, this pathway appears to participate in extinction in BLA at the "basal" levels, and at enhanced levels in DH. None of the treatments affected extinction when given into PARIE or CING. The present findings indicate that: (1) the DH and BLA are important for the initiation of extinction at the time of the first unreinforced retrieval session; (2) both the CaMKII and the PKA signaling pathway are necessary for the development of extinction in the two regions; (3) PARIE and CING are probably unrelated to extinction. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Impaired extinction retention in adolescent rats: Effects of d-cycloserine 
Neuropsychopharmacology , Volume 35, Issue 10, September 2010, Pages 2134-2142 
 
Abstract 
The developmental trajectory of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in both rats and humans is nonlinear, with a notable decline in synaptic density during adolescence, potentially creating a natural lesion preparation at this age. Given that the PFC is critically involved in retention of extinction of learned fear in adult humans and rodents, the present study examined whether adolescent rats exhibit impaired extinction retention. The results of experiment 1 showed that adolescent rats were impaired in extinction retention, compared with both younger and older rats. The partial NMDA receptor agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) improved extinction retention in adolescent rats (experiment 2), but only if administered immediately after extinction training (experiment 3). In addition, providing extended extinction training improved extinction retention in adolescent rats in a manner similar to that of DCS (experiment 4). The results of this study show that adolescent rats exhibit impaired extinction retention, and that this can be reduced through either DCS or extended extinction training. These novel findings have potential implications for clinical treatments of fear and anxiety disorders in adolescent patients. © 2010 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

Neuroscience , Volume 170, Issue 1, September 2010, Pages 92-98 
 
Abstract 
Post-learning rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation has often been shown to impair hippocampal functioning, which results in deficit in retrieval of some types of memory. However, it remains to be determined whether post-learning alteration of hippocampal functioning affects, in turn, REM sleep. Recent studies have shown that both post-extinction REM sleep deprivation and post-extinction application of hippocampal low-frequency stimulation (LFS) impair memory of fear extinction, indicating possible bidirectional interactions between hippocampal functioning and REM sleep. To analyze the potential effect of post-extinction alteration of hippocampal functioning on REM sleep, rats were implanted with stimulating electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus for post-extinction LFS. Sleep was recorded before (two sessions, 1 day apart) and after conditioning (five tone and eyelid-shock pairings), and following extinction training (25 tone-alone presentations) for 6 h per session. Fear conditioning reduced time spent in REM sleep, which was restored with fear extinction. Hippocampal LFS, applied immediately following extinction training, abolished the restorative effect of fear extinction on REM sleep and impaired extinction retrieval. These data extend previous findings and suggest bidirectional interactions between hippocampal functioning and REM sleep for successful extinction retrieval. © 2010 IBRO.

Abstract 
Limbic forebrain regions are anatomically positioned to integrate cortical and subcortical processing streams that mediate cognitive and emotional functions. Feedback projections to sensory cortices bias perceptual systems to process stimuli of high significance. The amygdala is critical for learning contingencies in the environment that predict emotional outcomes and for modulating explicit memory processes in the hippocampus. The anterior cingulate gyrus and ventromedial and orbital prefrontal cortices serve as interfaces that link emotional information processing and attentional control systems to guide goal-directed behavior. Dysregulation of the balance between affective and cognitive systems is a hallmark of anxiety and mood disorders.

Abstract 
Excessive fear and anxiety are hallmarks of a variety of disabling anxiety disorders that affect millions of people throughout the world. Hence, it is critical for the field of neuroscience to have a greater understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in the inhibition of fear. Experimentally, fear inhibition typically is analyzed with a procedure called extinction, in which a fearful stimulus is presented repeatedly in the absence of any aversive event. This leads to a decrease in the fear response that is gen
