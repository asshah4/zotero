Background—The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) has been implied to cause arrhythmias. To date, information on the role

of NCX in arrhythmogenesis derived from models with increased NCX expression, hypertrophy, and heart failure.

Furthermore, the exact mechanism by which NCX exerts its potentially proarrhythmic effect, ie, by promoting early

afterdepolarization (EAD) or delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) or both, is unknown.

Methods and Results—We investigated isolated cardiomyocytes from a murine model with heterozygous knockout of NCX

(hetKO) using the patch clamp and Ca2+ imaging techniques. Action potential duration was shorter in hetKO with I Ktot
not being increased. The rate of spontaneous Ca2+ release events and the rate of DADs were unaltered; however, DADs

had lower amplitude in hetKO. A DAD triggered a spontaneous action potential significantly less often in hetKO when

compared with wild-type. The occurrence of EADs was also drastically reduced in hetKO. ICa activity was reduced in hetKO, an effect that was abolished in the presence of the Ca2+ buffer BAPTA.

Conclusions—Genetic suppression of NCX reduces both EADs and DADs. The following molecular mechanisms

apply: (1) Although the absolute number of DADs is unaffected, an impaired translation of DADs into spontaneous

action potentials results from a reduced DAD amplitude. (2) EADs are reduced in absolute number of occurrence,

which is presumably a consequence of shortened action potential duration because of reduced NCX activity but also

reduced I the latter possibly being caused by a direct modulation of Ca2+-dependent I inhibition by reduced NCX

activity. This is the first study to demonstrate that genetic inhibition of NCX protects against afterdepolarizations

and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.  (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol. 2015;8:1210-1218.

The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) works as the main Ca2+ removal mechanism of the cardiac myocyte, extruding 1 Ca2+ ion to the extracellular compartment in exchange for 3 Na+ ions. Because of this electrogenic stoichiometry, NCX generates an electric inward current during elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This results in a prolongation of the action potential (AP) and may furthermore cause destabilization of the membrane potential resulting in cardiac arrhythmia by generation of early and late afterdepolarizations. Early afterdepolarizations (EAD) are defined as re-depolarizations occurring during the decay of the AP, whereas delayed afterdepolarizations (DAD) arise after full repolarization during electric diastole.
A DAD is thought to be initiated by a spontaneous sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release (sCR) event that is translated via NCX

inward mode into a depolarizing inward current forming a DAD.1 If the amplitude of the DAD exceeds the threshold for voltage gated Na+ channels (INa), a spontaneous AP (sAP) may occur, which may propagate and thus cause whole heart arrhythmia in the form of triggered activity.
It is unknown whether the same mechanism may be responsible for the occurrence of EADs. Some studies have suggested an NCX-independent mechanism: Thus, reactivation of Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels (ICa) during the repolarization phase may re-depolarize the membrane potential resulting in an EAD.2,3 However, others have suggested that DADs and EADs share a common mechanism that may be NCX dependent.4
To date, the role of chronically altered NCX expression in the generation of arrhythmia has been limited to models with

WHAT IS KNOWN
• The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) may pro-
mote afterdepolarizations of the cellular action potential thereby possibly causing ventricular arrhythmia, which may be especially crucial in patients with heart failure, where NCX expression is increased.
• So far it is unknown whether genetic reduction of
NCX expression may indeed suppress afterdepolarizations and - if yes - by which mechanism a potentially protective effect would work ie, by suppression of early or late afterdepolarizations or both.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• This is the first study demonstrating that genetic knock-
out of NCX protects from cellular afterdepolarizations.
• Knockout of NCX leads to a reduced amplitude of
delayed afterdepolarizations and also reduced the likelihood of early afterdepolarizations.
• This confirms that chronic and specific NCX inhi-
bition by pharmacological or genetic therapy could be a promising future strategy to treat ventricular arrhythmia.
increased NCX expression5 and to animal models of heart failure or hypertrophy1,6–10 in which NCX is known to be overexpressed. Yet, in heart failure, a multitude of proarrhythmic alterations other than the upregulation of NCX has been identified,11 most importantly a reduction of K+ currents12,13 which promote a prolongation of AP duration and the occurrence of arrhythmia.
It is therefore unknown whether genetic inhibition of NCX activity will suppress arrhythmia. Just as well, genetic inhibition may promote arrhythmia by mechanisms yet to be identified. If indeed genetic inhibition of NCX protects from afterdepolarizations, the question remains by which molecular mechanisms this protection is mediated. This could be a suppression of DADs, EADs, or even both, bearing the potential answer to the question of whether EADs and DADs share a common or a distinctly different molecular mechanism.
We here investigated a non-failing murine model with heterozygous global knockout of NCX (hetKO). The aim of this study was to determine whether genetic NCX suppression affects the occurrence of afterdepolarizations and, if yes, whether this effect is limited to DADs or also includes EADs. In a second step, this study aimed at investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead from reduced NCX activity to a potential antiarrhythmic effect by suppressing afterdepolarizations.
Methods
Generation of Heterozygous NCX Knockout Mice
Generation of heterozygous global NCX knockout mice has been reported previously.14 The genotype of every animal entering experimentation was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Breeding, housing, and experimentation were performed in accordance to the guidelines of the Westfälische Wilhelms-University Münster

and have been approved by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt, und Verbraucherschutz NRW. Animals used for experimentation were between 8 and 12.5 weeks of age.
Immunoblot Analysis
Immunoblot analysis on ventricular homogenates was performed as previously reported5 with minor modifications. Signal intensity was normalized to the housekeeping protein Csq.
Isolation of Ventricular Cardiomyocytes
Mice were sedated and euthanized with carbon dioxide inhalation. Single ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated as reported previously15 with modifications as reported in the Data Supplement.
Cellular Electrophysiology
AP measurements and the potassium carried outward current were conducted using the perforated patch clamp technique. When recording I , the ruptured clamp method was used. For details, including
Ca
intracellular and extracellular solutions, see Data Supplement.
Cellular Ca2+ Imaging
Fluorescence emission at 522 nm (fluo-4-AM) or 405 and 495 nm wavelength (indo-1-AM) was taken as an indicator for the cytosolic Ca2+ level. The fluorescence emission was plotted in arbitrary light units. Whenever the Ca2+ signal was directly compared between separate cells, the ratio of the fluorescence signal of indo-1 was used for this subset of experiments. Details are available in the Data Supplement.
Statistics
Statistical analyses and database management were performed using SigmaPlot 11.2.0.5 (Systat Software Inc.). Data are expressed as mean±SEM. Student unpaired 2-tailed t test was used for direct comparison between both genotypes and between different cell populations of the same genotype. We performed 1-way or 2-way ANOVA test where applicable and accounted for multiple comparisons with 2-sided Dunnett’s method or Bonferroni correction, respectively. Rates and proportions were quantified using the z test. Unless not otherwise quoted, P values were calculated using Student t test. A P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Expression of Ca2+ Handling and Structural Proteins To confirm reduced NCX expression in heterozygous NCX knockout mice and to detect potential alterations of key Ca2+ handling and structural proteins, we performed immunoblot analyses (Figure 1A).
NCX expression was significantly reduced to 46.6±9.2% in hetKO versus wild-type (WT; n=8 each; P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of ryanodine receptor (hetKO: n=5; WT: n=5), Ca 1.2 (hetKO: n=8; WT:
V
n=8), phosphorylated ryanodine receptor (here and for all following proteins hetKO: n=6; WT: n=6), Csq, Tni, Plb, Trd, Jcn, and SERCA.
Reduced NCX Activity in hetKO To validate, whether the reduced NCX expression leads to a reduced NCX activity in hetKO, caffeine (10 mmol/L) was rapidly applied to fluo-4-AM loaded isolated cardiomyocytes. Caffeine leads to a sudden and complete sarcoplasmic

Potassium Carried Outward Current in hetKO Versus WT To exclude that the shortening of the AP is caused by an increase of voltage gated K+ currents, we measured the total K+ carried peak outward current (IKtot). IKtot was recorded in voltage clamped cardiomyocytes using perforated patch configuration in the presence of tetrodotoxin (10 µmol/L) and nifedipine (2 µmol/L) to avoid contamination of the recorded current by INa or ICa. Cells were clamped at −80 mV and then depolarized by square wave pulses (duration 1 s) ranging from −40 to +60 mV (Figure 3A). IKtot peak current was normalized to cell capacitance. Inactivation kinetics of I was measured

There was a trend toward a slowed inactivation of IKtot in hetKO; however, this finding was not statistically significant (T25 in ms: WT, 53.6±9.7; hetKO: 79.6±10.3; P=0.08 hetKO versus WT). Cell capacitance was unaltered between hetKO and WT (in pF: WT, 117.2±9.0; hetKO, 122.2±8.3; P=0.69 hetKO versus WT).
Unaltered Spontaneous SR Ca2+ Release in hetKO Versus WT Ca2+ transients of field stimulated fluo-4-AM-loaded cardiomyocytes were recorded during a stimulation protocol that was comprised of abrupt changes in pacing cycle length (20 sweeps each in Hz: 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.5, 0.125, 1, and 3 minutes of rest). This protocol was repeated in the presence of 1 µmol/L isoproterenol.
Throughout the protocol irregular Ca2+ activity was observed as (1) sCR, defined as a non–field-stimulated rise

of the fluorescence signal during diastole; and (2) Ca2+ oscillations, defined as repeated-fluorescence upstrokes during the decay phase of a field stimulated fully developed Ca2+ transient (Figure 4A). The number of sCR events per all investigated cells was not significantly different between hetKO and WT (sCR/cell: WT, 70.4±10.1; n=30; hetKO, 54.8±9.3; n=27; P=0.26 WT versus hetKO; Figure 4B). The number of oscillations per all investigated cells was significantly smaller in hetKO than in WT (oscillations/cell: WT, 58.4±10.5; n=30; hetKO, 15.5±4.7; n=27; P<0.05 WT versus hetKO; Figure 4C).
Reduced DAD Amplitude and Reduced Occurrence of sAPs in hetKO Versus WT Occurrence of DADs and sAPs was investigated in isolated amphotericin-perforated cardiomyocytes subjected to a proarrhythmic stimulation protocol (20 sweeps each in Hz: 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 3 minutes of rest) that was repeated in the presence of isoproterenol (1 µmol/L) followed by 50 repetitions of an S2-beat-protocol containing 4 sweeps with 5 Hz followed by 1 short coupled sweep after 50 ms and a subsequent period of rest for 4 s.
DADs were defined as temporary depolarizations of low amplitude during electric diastole, whereas sAPs were defined as full APs exceeding −10mV threshold triggered by a DAD and not by a current clamp command (Figure 5A). Each sAP was also numerically counted as a DAD because each sAP was triggered by a DAD. The number of cells showing DADs was not different between WT (19 of 20 [95%]) and hetKO (17 of 20 [85%]; P=0.60 WT versus hetKO; z test; Figure 5C), however, the number of cells exhibiting sAPs was significantly smaller in hetKO (hetKO: 6 of 20 [30%]; WT: 15 of 20 [75%]; P<0.05 WT versus hetKO; z test; Figure 5C).
The number of DADs averaged to all investigated cells was also not significantly different between WT and hetKO (DAD/ cell: WT, 40.3±12.2; n=20; hetKO, 47.9±12.0; n=20; P=0.66 hetKO versus WT; Figure 5D), whereas the number of sAPs averaged to all investigated cells was significantly smaller in hetKO (sAPs/cell: WT, 10.6±3.0; n=20; hetKO, 2.1±1.1; n=20; P<0.05 hetKO versus WT; Figure 5E). Furthermore, in those cells that exhibited DADs (event-positive cells), the ratio of sAP/DAD was significantly smaller in hetKO than in WT. The mean amplitude of DADs was significantly reduced in hetKO versus WT (mean DAD amplitude in mV: WT, 4.52±0.09; hetKO, 2.89±0.05; P<0.05 hetKO versus WT; Figure 5B). At the same time, the mean duration of DADs was significantly prolonged in hetKO versus WT (mean DAD duration in s: WT, 0.58±0.02; hetKO, 0.67±0.01; P<0.05 hetKO versus WT).
Reduced Occurrence of EADs in hetKO EADs were defined as re-depolarizations during repolarization of the AP that exceeded −40 mV after the membrane potential had dropped to below −40 mV (Figure 6A–6C). The shape of the EADs varied between temporary membrane fluctuations up to multiple steep upstrokes.
The number of cells exhibiting EADs was significantly smaller in hetKO (2 of 20 [10%]) than in WT (17 of 20 [85%]; P<0.05 WT versus hetKO; z test; Figure 6D). The number of

Discussion
This study is the first to evaluate the effect of genetically suppressed NCX activity on the generation of arrhythmia and the underlying cellular mechanisms. It is also the first study to investigate the effects of chronic and specific NCX inhibition on the generation of arrhythmia because synthetic NCX inhibitors lack specificity19–23 and—to our knowledge—have only been applied acutely as single shot applications and not chronically in the investigation of arrhythmia.23,24
Knockout of NCX Suppresses Cellular Proarrhythmia Heterozygous KO mice did not show changes in the expression pattern of key Ca2+ handling and structural proteins (Figure 1A) or evidence of cellular hypertrophy as assessed by electric capacitance. Also, SR Ca2+ load (Figure 1D), the diastolic and the systolic Ca2+ levels were unaltered. A previous study has demonstrated normal whole heart cardiac function

and morphology and no signs of structural heart disease or clinical cardiovascular pathology in hetKO.14 We observed a slight but significant reduction of IKtot in hetKO, however, this can neither explain the reduced AP duration nor the suppression of EADs, because reduced IKtot would tend to prolong AP duration instead of shortening it.
The observed suppression of afterdepolarizations thus seems to be a genuine consequence of reduced NCX activity—and potentially its direct influence on I activity—and
Ca
not of long-term remodeling of cellular electrophysiology or Ca2+ homeostasis as an adaption to NCX knockout.
Although in our model both EADs and DADs are suppressed, the molecular mechanisms by which reduction of NCX activity achieves this suppression may differ in both cases and are thus discussed separately in the following.
NCX Knockout Suppresses Translation of DADs into sAPs DADs are triggered by sCR events. DADs are temporary depolarizations of low amplitude that occur during electric diastole and may or may not trigger a spontaneous AP. Thus, in mechanistic terms, the spontaneous AP occurs downstream

of the DAD and therefore the spontaneous AP has to be regarded as the final proarrhythmic substrate or proarrhythmic effector leading to triggered activity and arrhythmia of the whole heart.
The most significant finding of this study is that NCX knockout does not reduce the absolute number of sCR events or DADs, but instead, it drastically reduces the number of spontaneous APs. How is this made possible? Any sCR from the SR will lead to a temporary increase of subsarcolemmal Ca2+ concentration which will drive NCX inward mode. If there are less NCX proteins expressed in the membrane, the peak amplitude of the NCX current will be smaller. At the same time, if the amount of spontaneously released SR Ca2+ is similar, NCX inactivation will be slower, that is, the period of NCX activity will be longer to extrude the same amount of Ca2+, a finding that has been demonstrated in previous studies.5,25–27 This would result in a DAD of smaller amplitude but longer duration as observed in this study (Figure 5). Because the triggering of a spontaneous AP is an all or nothing response, it is the peak amplitude of a DAD and not the absolute number of DADs or the duration of the individual DAD that is crucial for the generation of sAPs. In other words, a small number of high amplitude DADs are more likely to trigger a spontaneous AP than large numbers of low amplitude DADs. In our model, this is the mechanism by which NCX knockout impairs the translation of DADs into spontaneous APs.
Suppression of EADs: Reduced AP Duration and Interaction of NCX With L-type Ca2+ Current It is currently not fully understood whether EADs and DADs share an identical mechanism, ie, whether NCX is involved only in the generation of DADs or also plays a role in the generation of EADs.
The classic concept of NCX-mediated arrhythmia is that during diastole an sCR event is translated via NCX forward mode into a DAD, which subsequently triggers a spontaneous AP, and a similar mechanism has also been proposed for the role of NCX in the generation of EADs. However, the potential mechanisms underlying EADs seem to be more complex and ambiguous. EADs occur during the AP plateau or repolarization. During this phase, a multitude of ion channels are active, and ionic gradients are fluctuating. Thus, several alternative mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the generation of EADs, including K+ current populations,28 late Na+ current,29,30 and predominantly ICa.3
Therefore, one of the key findings of this study is that a selective suppression of NCX activity via knockout not only suppresses DADs but also drastically reduces the occurrence of EADs and Ca2+ oscillations (Figures 4 and 6).
One obvious mechanism of this phenomenon is that the reduction of the AP duration (Figure 2) may reduce the occurrence of EADs in hetKO because EADs are more likely to occur when there is a prolongation of the AP.31 The reduction of NCX inward current alone may reduce AP duration to a degree where a suppression of EADs is achieved. However, the reduction of ICa activity (Figure 7A and 7B) as observed in this study may well also contribute to the shortening of the AP and thereby to the suppression of EADs because I
Ca

is an inward current and its reduction would thus accelerate

repolarization.

If the shortening of the AP was exclusively caused by

reduced inward NCX current, one would not expect a reduc-

tion of the APD during the early and positive potentials of the

AP, because under these conditions, NCX reverse mode might

be favored. Indeed, the most obvious absolute shortening of

the AP was observed during later stages of the AP, however,

the acceleration of the repolarization already reached signifi-

cance at 25% repolarization, which in the spike-like murine

AP is still relatively early. It is debatable whether NCX inward

current, which is substantially driven by Ca2+ induced SR Ca2+

release, is already fully developed at this early stage. ICa activation precedes SR Ca2+ release and thus maximum activation

of NCX inward mode may influence APD earlier than NCX

inward mode. Thus, the accelerated repolarization during

the early stages of the AP observed in hetKO are most likely

caused by the combination of reduced NCX inward current

and reduced inward I . Ca Since Ca 1.2 expression was not altered between both V
genotypes, we aimed at investigating whether the suppres-

sion of I in hetKO is caused by a functional interaction Ca

between NCX and I . One of the strongest inhibitors of I is

Ca

Ca

Ca2+-dependent inactivation. We therefore repeated I meaCa

surements in the presence of the Ca2+ buffer BAPTA. BAPTA

supresses Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICa because subsarcolemmal Ca2+ is buffered and therefore cannot function as an

inhibitor of ICa. In the presence of BAPTA, the differences of
ICa amplitude between hetKO and WT were eliminated, suggesting enhanced Ca2+-dependent inactivation as the cause

for ICa suppression in hetKO (Figure 7C). These findings are in line with previous studies in other murine models with

altered NCX expression.16,17 These observations support the

hypothesis that reduced Ca2+ extrusion capacity by reduced

NCX activity promotes Ca2+-dependent ICa inactivation by accumulation of Ca2+ in the dyadic cleft. Thus, next to the

genetic suppression of NCX inward current, this direct func-

tional interplay between NCX and I will also contribute to Ca
the observed reduction of AP duration and the suppression

of EAD in hetKO. The reduction of I is also essential for Ca
the cell to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis: because knockout of

NCX reduces cellular Ca2+ extrusion, the cell has to limit Ca2+

uptake to avoid Ca2+ overload. This observation is supported

by previous findings in a model with homozygous (com-

plete) knockout of NCX.16,25 Further evidence for this adap-

tive mechanism has been obtained in a model with increased

NCX expression in which—complementary to NCX knock-

out mice—ICa is increased,5,17 thereby preventing cellular Ca2+ loss because of increased Ca2+ removal by increased NCX

activity.

The fact that in hetKO ICa is also reduced at higher potentials, where NCX inward mode is unlikely to be active suggests

that altered NCX activity may also influence subsarcolemmal

Ca2+ during the diastolic part of the excitation contraction

cycle.32 Possibly, reduced Ca2+ extrusion during diastole leads

to subsarcolemmal Ca2+ accumulation promoting ICa inactivation. This again could result in some Ca2+ channels being inac-

tivated even before or very early during depolarization, which

would explain a reduction of I even at higher potentials. As Ca

an alternative explanation, intracellular Ca2+ might also affect and modulate the voltage sensor of the L-type-Ca2+ channel, a mechanism that has been suggested by a previous study.33 Future studies are necessary to resolve this issue.
If Ca2+-dependent inhibition of ICa is more pronounced in the face of reduced NCX expression, one would not only expect a reduced I amplitude but also an accelerated inacti-
Ca
vation of I . Indeed, this has been observed in homozygous Ca
knockout mice16,25 and—conversely—a slowed inactivation was observed in homozygous overexpressor mice.5,17 In our study, we also observed a trend toward accelerated ICa inactivation in heterozygous KO mice, however, other than in homozygous KO mice, this trend did not reach statistical significance. One explanation may be that in homozygous KO mice, there is a complete NCX ablation, whereas in the heterozygous KO mice used in this study, NCX is only reduced to about half the normal expression level, thus resulting in a milder effect of NCX suppression on I inactivation.
Ca
Because altered NCX activity may also alter the dynamics of intracellular Na+ concentration and thereby the Na+ gradient, we cannot exclude that knockout of NCX affects the voltage-dependent Na+ current (INa) or—vice versa—that altered I will affect NCX activity. This may also influence AP dura-
Na
tion and proarrhythmia in the face of altered NCX activity. Future studies are necessary to address this issue.
In contrast to DADs, which exhibited a characteristic all or nothing response that allowed easy separation of DADs from spontaneous APs (Figure 5), this was different in the case of EADs that appeared in several shapes and forms. To apply standard criteria, we defined an EAD as a redepolarization to more than −40 mV during the declining phase of the AP (after the membrane potential had first dropped to less than −40 mV). Applying these criteria, EADs ranged in shapes from mild temporary membrane fluctuations to steep upstrokes reaching up to potentials of >30 mV (Figure 6A–6C). Because the shapes of EADs were randomly distributed between these extremes, we were unable to mechanistically distinguish EADs from spontaneous APs. This may be a specific problem of murine models, where the plateau of the AP is at a low voltage when compared with higher mammals.34
As a limitation of this study, a direct transfer of our results to human pathophysiology should only be undertaken with caution, because in humans, myocardial cellular electrophysiology significantly differs from murine electrophysiology as reflected by the much longer action potential. Thus, the pathophysiology of proarrhythmia may also differ between species. Also, as with other genetically modified murine models of arrhythmia, direct comparisons between different murine models may not be always be possible because different pacing protocols and different genetic backgrounds are used.5,29,35
Conclusions This is the first work to investigate the effect of genetic NCX knockout on arrhythmogenesis and on the underlying molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms. This study demonstrates that chronic and specific NCX knockout directly reduces cellular proarrhythmia mediated by both late and early afterdepolarizations, although the underlying mechanisms downstream of NCX inhibition may differ. NCX

knockout mice are thereby one of the few genetic models in which genetic manipulation does not result in a proarrhythmic phenotype but rather a phenotype that is protected against afterdepolarizations. Because cardiac diseases like heart failure are accompanied by NCX overexpression, the findings of this study should encourage further research on NCX suppression as a promising target for clinical pharmacological or genetic therapy to counter arrhythmia.
