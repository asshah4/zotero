The relationship of vocal tract shape to three voice qualities 
 
Three-dimensional vocal tract shapes and consequent area functions representing the vowels [i, æ, ɑ, u] have been obtained from one male and one female speaker using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The two speakers were trained vocal performers and both were adept at manipulation of vocal tract shape to alter voice quality. Each vowel was performed three times, each with one of the three voice qualities: normal, yawny, and twangy. The purpose of the study was to determine some ways in which th...

A study of sentence stress production in Mandarin speakers of American English 
 
Acoustic characteristics of American English sentence stress produced by native Mandarin speakers are reported. Fundamental frequency (F0), vowel duration, and vowel intensity in the sentence-level stress produced by 40 Mandarin speakers were compared to those of 40 American English speakers. Results obtained from two methods of stress calculation indicated that Mandarin speakers of American English are able to differentiate stressed and unstressed words according to features of F0, duration, an...

Preliminary data were collected on how emotional qualities of the voice (sad, happy, angry) influence the acoustic underpinnings of neutral sentences varying in location of intra-sentential focus (initial, final, no) and utterance “modality” (statement, question). Short (six syllable) and long (ten syllable) utterances exhibiting varying combinations of emotion, focus, and modality characteristics were analyzed for eight elderly speakers following administration of a controlled elicitation paradigm (story completion) and a speaker evaluation procedure. Duration and fundamental frequency ( f 0) parameters of recordings were scrutinized for “keyword” vowels within each token and for whole utterances. Results generally re-affirmed past accounts of how duration and f 0 are encoded on key content words to mark linguistic focus in affectively neutral statements and questions for English. Acoustic data on three “global” parameters of the stimuli (speech rate, mean f 0, f 0 range) were also largely supportive of previous descriptions of how happy, sad, angry, and neutral utterances are differentiated in the speech signal. Important interactions between emotional and linguistic properties of the utterances emerged which were predominantly (although not exclusively) tied to the modulation of f 0; speakers were notably constrained in conditions which required them to manipulate f 0 parameters to express emotional and nonemotional intentions conjointly. Sentence length also had a meaningful impact on some of the measures gathered. © 2001 Acoustical Society of America.
