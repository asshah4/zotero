Up to one fifth of patients with cardiovascular disease, including those who have experienced a

myocardial infarction, may have concomitant major depression. Studies have suggested that the rela-

Ctive risk of major depression with cardiovascular disease ranges from 1.5 to 4.5. Further information

is required to establish a dose-response relationship between depression and coronary artery disease

op (CAD); however, such a relationship has been shown between anxiety and CAD. Development of a

y conceptual model of the pathophysiologic actions of stress in CAD will assist in the understanding of

r this relationship. In patients with angiographic evidence of CAD, the presence of major depressive

ig disorder was the best single predictor of cardiac events during the 12 months following diagnosis. Sig-

h nificantly, 6-month cumulative mortality following diagnosis of myocardial infarction has been

t shown to be higher in depressed patients than in nondepressed patients. A decrease in heart rate vari-

2 ability may mediate the deleterious effect of depression on post–myocardial infarction prognosis.

0 Other factors such as mental stress and altered platelet function may also predispose depressed pa-

0 tients to a heightened risk of cardiac events. With an increased understanding of the relationship be-

O 1 tween depression and heightened risk of cardiovascular mortality, it is necessary to assess current

ne P overall treatment for cardiac patients.

re TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ss, One way to examine the adequacy of the evidence reIn lating depression and anxiety to cardiovascular disease is c. to use classic epidemiologic principles to assess causality.

The main criteria used for assessment are strength of association (risk ratio), dose-response relationships, consistency of association, and temporally correct association. Some current studies relating depression to coronary artery disease (CAD) have methodological weaknesses that make assessing the strength of the association inconclusive. For example, when psychiatric diagnostic instruments that have not been modified are used to determine the prevalence of depression, they may not have the same validity for patients with CAD as they do in the general population. Excluding some patients because of the severity of their cardiovascular disease and measuring depressive symptoms at different times after hospital admission also reduce the validity of the analysis. However, some of the studies of the link between cardiovascular disease and depression are relatively well controlled, are prospective in design, use structured clinical interviews with diagnostic instruments, include other risk factors for

CAD in their analysis, and control for demographic fac-

tors.6–15 In these studies, the relative risk of major depres-

sion or depressive symptoms for cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease–related death ranges from 1.5 to 4.5. These relative risks are quite high for epidemiologic studies, so it would seem that the strength of the association is quite reasonable and impressive in magnitude. Therefore, there are good data to support the criterion of strength of association between the risk factor of depression and CAD.

ht 20 So far there are no studies showing that patients with 0 more severe depression have more severe cardiovascular O 1 disease. Furthermore, a temporally correct association has ne P not been made. Very few studies have been prospectively pe h designed to see if patients who are initially depressed rso ys without evidence of cardiovascular disease will develop na ic CAD. Neither is there any evidence as yet to show that l i adequate treatment of depression produces a decrease cop an in subsequent events. Two studies, the Enhanced Recovy s ery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) trial and the m P Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Recovery Trial ay o (SADHART), are currently active and should provide rebe st sults within the next few years. p g Patients with more severe anxiety have been shown to rin ra develop more severe CAD. Kawachi et al.16 published data te d on a prospective study of phobic anxiety and the risk of d ua CAD in men. Thirty-four thousand U.S. male health prot fessionals who were initially free of cardiovascular dise ease at baseline were assessed using the Crown-Crisp ExP periential Index. The age-adjusted relative risk of fatal re CAD was significantly different when the highest and ss lowest subsets were compared and adjusted for other po, tentially confounding variables. Interestingly, the excess In risk was confined to sudden death. The study did not, howc ever, measure other personality or psychiatric variables . such as indices of depression. A more recent literature re-

stress, either acute or chronic, produces certain physiologic responses via the central nervous system. These consist of increases in catecholamines, heart rate, and blood pressure; increased coronary vasoconstriction; and increased platelet activity. The cardiac effects of these responses are modified by background factors including atherosclerosis, prior myocardial infarction, and degree of left ventricular function. These cardiac effects can raise electrical instability, thereby triggering arrhythmias. This, in turn, may lead to sudden cardiac death, increased myocardial oxygen demand that can result in ischemia, or decreased myocardial oxygen supply that can also result in ischemia, leading to either sudden cardiac death or myocardial infarction. In addition, acute changes in hemodynamics and neurohormonal levels can occur. An acute rise in blood pressure and catecholamines precipitates plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis, resulting in myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death.
The evidence for this conceptual model of the pathophysiologic actions of stress in CAD is quite extensive. Many studies have documented evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortical excess hyperactivity in medication-free patients with major depression. These studies have shown elevated corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) concentrations in cerebral spinal fluid, abnormal suppression of cortisol secretion following dexa-

ht 200 EFFECT OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY O 1 ON PROGNOSIS AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ne pe Ph One of the earliest studies looking at the relationship rso ys between depression and CAD was published by Carney na ic and colleagues2 in 1987. They studied 50 patients in whom l i coronary angioplasty had shown evidence of CAD. Pacop an tients were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory26 y s and a semistructured interview for depression (DSM-III m P criteria), in addition to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.27 ay o Twenty-six percent of patients screened met criteria for be st major depression. Patients taking β-blockers did not differ p g from other patients with regard to presence or absence of rin ra major depressive illness or severity of depression. Unite d variate correlations for the presence of any cardiac event d ua with risk factors and medications were analyzed. The t strongest univariate correlations were left ventricular ejece tion fraction, severity of CAD, and major depressive disP order (R values, 0.3–0.4). The presence of major depresre sive disorder was the best single predictor of cardiac ss events during the first 12 months following diagnostic , coronary angiography. The impact of major depressive In disorder was at least equivalent to that of left ventricular c dysfunction and history of previous myocardial infarction. . Subsequently, many studies have been published look-

and diabetes, were enrolled. These men were aged 47 to 56 years on entry. Heart rate variability was measured with paced deep breathing. The standard deviation of the heart rate and the maximum minus the minimum heart rate over 1 minute were determined. Heart rate variability is defined as the standard deviation of successive intervals between 2 consecutive R waves on an electrocardiogram, in normal sinus rhythm; it reflects the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic input on the heart. A high degree of heart rate variability is observed in normal hearts, whereas patients with severe CAD or heart failure can have significantly decreased heart rate variability.
After adjusting for age, men reporting higher levels of phobic anxiety had a higher resting heart rate (p = .025). After adjusting for age, mean heart rate, and body mass index, men reporting higher levels of phobic anxiety had lower heart rate variability (p = .03). These data suggest that phobic anxiety is associated with altered cardiac autonomic control and hence might predispose to increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It was, however, unclear whether phobic anxiety caused diminished heart rate variability or vice versa. Moreover, the investigators could not rule out the presence of subclinical CAD during their study. Assessments of heart rate variability were made from short-lasting electrocardiographic (ECG) records, whereas many previous studies have used 24 hours of electrocardiographic recordings. In addition, a high score on the Crown-Crisp Index does not necessarily imply a clinical diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Nevertheless, the findings are quite interesting and provocative.
The risk of subsequent cardiac events for patients with heart disease has been shown in numerous studies to be related to decreased heart rate variability and/or increased sympathetic tone. Reduced high-frequency heart rate variability has been observed in depressed patients when com-

ing at the relationship between depression and CAD pared with nondepressed patients. In patients with con-

events in patients with either stable CAD or recent myo- firmed CAD, diminished heart rate variability during

cardial infarction.1,28 For example, Frasure-Smith et al.1 24-hour Holter monitoring was more common in de-

may Po MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA be st IN RESPONSE TO MENTAL STRESS pringra Recently, several studies have shown that, in the labote d ratory, patients with CAD respond to acute psychological d ua stress with myocardial ischemia. Most of the studies have t included patients with documented CAD. Fifty percent of e patients with documented CAD and positive exercise tests P have evidence of psychological stress–induced ischemia, re detected in the laboratory using radionuclide techniques. ss Several investigators, including Jiang and colleagues,33 , have shown that these responses in the laboratory are assoIn ciated with abnormally high event rates on follow-up. c During a 5-year period, Jiang and colleagues33 followed up . 126 patients with CAD. Psychological stress–induced

dence of ischemia due to mental stress during the Stroop mental stress task. Analysis of heart rate variability measures provided evidence of altered autonomic responses in patients showing mental stress ischemia. During the Stroop task, patients with mental stress ischemia had decreases in high-frequency and low-frequency power compared with patients without mental stress ischemia. These data suggest that ischemic responses to mental stress were associated with increased sympathetic activation and/or vagal withdrawal. Thus, the increased risk associated with low heart rate variability in cardiac patients may be due in part to psychological stress and associated changes in cardiac autonomic balance. Furthermore, acute stressors in the laboratory and chronic stressors such as depression and anxiety may have similar pathophysiologic mechanisms in predisposing patients to risk and may in fact be additive.
ALTERED PLATELET FUNCTION
Platelet mechanisms linking depression and heart disease are supported by associations between cerebrovascular disease and depression. The Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly prospective study assessed 10,294 persons who were 65 years and older. Stroke rates were 2.3 to 2.7 times higher in persons designated as “high” compared with “low” on depressive symptoms.36
The actions of platelets are thought to be central in the development of atherosclerosis and in the precipitation of sudden death or other acute coronary syndromes. Platelets have receptors for catecholamine and serotonin (5-HT). Increased levels of catecholamines, such as those found in depression, could initiate platelet responses, including aggregation and precipitation of
