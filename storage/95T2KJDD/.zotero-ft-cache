ABSTRACT
The increased analytical sensitivity of capillary electrophoresis detects additional irregularities that are suspicious for a monoclonal component. This is most noticeable in the beta-1-, beta-2- and gamma-globulin fractions. The causes of non-monoclonal irregularities are manifold, but are rarely reported back to the ordering physician. This article reviews the basic concepts to correctly identify irregularities, monoclonal and oligoclonal peaks by capillary electrophoresis. It then focuses on detecting and reporting typical non-monoclonal irregularities according to their electrophoresis fractions as well as their possible clinical implications.

1. Introduction
Protein electrophoresis provides information about the protein status of components that are present in large quantities, i.e. the g/L range in the human body. An altered relationship of these proteins provides surprisingly detailed disease information, for instance acute or chronic inﬂammation, antibody deﬁciency, protein synthesis/loss or nutritional status. The most common application today is, however, the detection of monoclonal components, i.e. immunoglobulins which are caused by the abnormal proliferation of plasma cells. A monoclonal component usually appears as and is called an additional band when it is visible on a gel. It is usually referred to as an additional peak when the sample is analyzed by densitometry after gel or capillary electrophoresis. Frequent synonyms are extragradient, extra-band, extra-peak, monoclonal fraction, monoclonal protein, monoclonal immunoglobulin, paraprotein, M-protein, Mspike, etc. Small monoclonal components sometimes do not present as distinct fractions, but rather appear with gel band deformations or shape irregularities of the densitometric curve. Various degrees of asymmetry are most frequent in the normally symmetrically alpha-2-, beta-1- and beta-2-fraction. These irregularities are usually named after their shape; for instance, tail, broadness, bridge, plateau, swell, shoulder, bump, bulge, wiggle, up-slant, downslope, depression, etc. The detection of a monoclonal component in the alpha-2-, beta-1- or beta-2-fraction is challenging if the electrophoretic mobility is nearly identical to the proteins regularly present in this fraction. This has been named

comigration, masked or hidden monoclonal component. Often the corresponding fraction is elevated, presents with a very sharp peak or the beta-2-fraction may exceed the beta-1 fraction. Small amounts of monoclonal proteins may display no electrophoretic abnormalities and the monoclonal component is only visible in immunoﬁxation. Monoclonal free light chains often do not present as distinct bands or peaks. Sometimes they present with a decrease of the gamma-globulin fraction. This requires additional, mandatory testing for free light chains and/or immunoﬁxation in serum and urine. Non-monoclonal, so called pseudo-monoclonal substances may also cause additional bands or peaks and resemble monoclonal components. These also require immunoﬁxation to rule out. (Refer to footnote1 for details on the usage of terminology in this article)
Agarose or capillary protein electrophoresis has a detection limit for monoclonal proteins of 0.5–1 g/L while immunoﬁxation detects bands down to the 50–100 mg/L range. Immunoﬁxation therefore deﬁnes the absence of a monoclonal band and classiﬁes therapeutic response categories [1].
A study with 5992 protein electrophoresis samples initiated reﬂex immunoﬁxation in 13.2% of abnormal samples, which were considered suspicious for monoclonal components. Immunoﬁxation identiﬁed 43% of the abnormalities as monoclonal (100% of all M-spikes and 28% of the other SPE abnormalities) [2]. There is some controversy whether immunoﬁxation should run with every serum electrophoresis [1] or whether it may be only of beneﬁt in clinical laboratories using poor

resolution electrophoresis in the beta region, where it assists in the detection of mainly IgA monoclonal protein. Immunoﬁxation may also increase the detection of trace bands of questionable clinical signiﬁcance which represent transient phenomena in infectious and autoimmune conditions or very low risk MGUS [3–5].
The detection of monoclonal components has been largely improved by capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis estimates monoclonal peaks more accurately, because there are no varying dye binding aﬃnities of proteins as seen with agarose gel electrophoresis [6]. The better diﬀerentiation of the beta region into beta-1- and beta-2globulin fractions also improves their detection [7,8]. If a monoclonal component has been excluded by immunoﬁxation, the origin of the irregularity is rarely reported back to the ordering physician, because this requires profound knowledge within the reporting laboratory.
Here, we review non-monoclonal causes of irregularities in capillary serum protein electrophoresis and their possible clinical implications. The terms used in laboratory medicine are not standardized and diﬀer between individuals, hospitals, countries and languages. This is deﬁnitely an area of laboratory medicine that requires standardization and would be a worthwhile task for the IFCC Working Group on

Harmonization of Interpretive Commenting. Here we use the terms we established in our institutions, i.e. extragradient, monoclonal component and M-gradient to describe the irregularities present in capillary electrophoresis.
2. Basics of capillary serum protein electrophoresis interpretation
In order to recognize relevant alterations in protein electrophoresis the assessor must not only know the location of the proteins physiologically present (Fig. 1) but also interpret their most common variants. There are numerous inﬂuences that determine the presence of a protein and thus the curve in the electrophoresis graph: phenotypic variants (genes), age; synthesis (liver function, antibody deﬁciency syndrome), malnutrition, renal diseases, enteral malabsorption, dermal loss, inﬂammation, malignancy, hormones (pregnancy, contraceptives, thyroid) or medication (immunosuppressants). In addition, increases or decreases may be seen not only with single proteins but appear also as typical group protein reactions, for instance as acute phase response.
A valid interpretation of the electrophoresis curve includes the measurement of total protein. The percentual value of each protein fraction should be converted to g/L. However, the reporting of electrophoresis values only as percentages still exists today, although the quantiﬁcation of monoclonal gradients requires absolute values and absolute numbers are well established in laboratory medicine. A blood diﬀerential of 40% granulocytes and 50% lymphocytes, for instance, does not distinguish neutropenia from lymphocytosis without their absolute values. Equally, absolute concentrations are mandatory to correctly interpret electrophoresis. An albumin concentration of 50.8% (decreased) and a gamma fraction of 18.6% (elevated) will yield different reference range and abnormal absolute values even if total protein only varies within its reference range (66–83 g/L, Fig. 2).
Grey shaded circles indicate reference range values for albumin (35–53 g/L) and gamma-globulin (5.6–15.0 g/L), red circles indicate pathological values. A sample with a ﬁxed relative albumin concentration of 50.8% (decreased) and gamma-globulin of 18.6% (increased) yields diﬀerent absolute normal or pathological results when total protein is varying within the reference range (66–83 g/L): Albumin decreases below 35 g/L when total protein is below 70 g/L, while gamma-globulin is increased above the reference range in samples with a total protein above 78 g/L. Albumin as well as the gammaglobulins are reference range when the total protein concentrations is between 70 and 78 g/L.
Surprisingly, absolute reference ranges established under IFCC

criteria (minimum of 120 samples and analysis by nonparametric statistical methods [9]) under rigid selection of the reference population (e.g. normal values for kidney and liver parameters, ferritin, CRP, cholesterol and triglycerides) are not available for serum protein electrophoresis. Our own reference range study of > 500 working subjects covering an age range from 17 to 93 years yielded diﬀerent from the published results. The main diﬀerence was in the albumin concentration that was substantially lower in subjects older than 60 years (data prepared for publication) [10].
The reference concept so commonly used in laboratory medicine, however, is only partially applicable to the interpretation of protein electrophoresis. An increased globulin fraction may indicate presence of a monoclonal gammopathy but irregularities will only be detected by the time-consuming visual evaluation of each electrophoresis curve. This should include inspection for an additional fraction or peak in the curve (extragradient), an unusual fraction shape (asymmetry) or an unusual elevation of a fraction (comigration). Extragradient evaluation, though, is non-standardized and method as well as user skill dependent. This challenging task can be automated by mathematical curve analysis [11], which we improved and expanded in our software (Fig. 3, see details in Section 4).
In addition, the best electrophoretic quantiﬁcation method for monoclonal gradients, tangent skimming, provides a 10-fold improvement in precision but is rarely used [12,13].
2.1. Recognition of irregularities, monoclonal and oligoclonal peaks by capillary electrophoresis
Technically, capillary electrophoresis has some advantages over agarose electrophoresis. Immune complexes that can be misinterpreted on agarose gels and thus require treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol for complete resolution are mostly resolved in the liquid medium of capillary electrophoresis. Additional peaks are detected which improves the recognition of phenotypic variants and irregularities. Capillary electrophoresis provides higher resolution with more detailed curve data and increases sensitivity for the recognition of monoclonal proteins. However, some non-proteins can present as irregularities, because all substances absorbing at 200 nm are detected. This decreases speciﬁcity and complicates the interpretation of pathological samples. Other drawbacks are that smaller irregularities can still be missed during the visual evaluation of capillary electrophoresis, which requires a careful and time-consuming analysis with the zoom function of the sebia scan software. There are also some diﬀerences in the detection of pure light chain myelomas compared with the quantitative methods as well as a weakness detecting smaller IgM gammopathies. Also, “nonhomogeneously stained” gamma regions on agarose electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation are not always present in capillary electrophoresis [14–16]. These samples with unclear banding (also called “zoning” or “stained non-homogeneously”) are usually resolved with immunoﬁxation after 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol treatment. In our

experience immunoﬁxation on a high-resolution gel is far superior. The resolution of the electrophoresis improves with separation length which is crucial for the detection of minor bands. This usually either resolves the non-homogeneous staining or unclear banding or it identiﬁes the monoclonal protein hiding within an oligoclonal pattern. In our own comparison 43 ambigious specimens investigated with routine immunoﬁxation proved to be either artefacts (n = 15), oligoclonals (n = 12) or faint monoclonal fractions (n = 16) on a high-resolution gel [17].
3. Irregularities in electrophoresis fractions
3.1. Albumin fraction
Albumin functions primarily as a carrier protein. In capillary electrophoresis lipids usually migrate beneath the albumin fraction, but the quantiﬁed values are usually slightly lower when compared with agarose measurements [18,19]. Overall, albumin is more accurately quantiﬁed by capillary electrophoresis, whereas in agarose gel electrophoresis it varies substantially depending on the protein binding aﬃnities of the applied colorant.
Increases: These are almost always caused by dehydration. Decreases: A fraction decrease accompanies a relative increase of the other fractions (alpha, beta, gamma), while total protein usually remains in the reference range. A singular decreased fraction is seen in malnutrition, decreased synthesis or loss (nephrotic syndrome). Irregularities (Fig. 4): This includes in the anodal part an increase of transthyretin (“prealbumin”), and the split albumin fraction present

in bisalbuminemia [19–23]. Bisalbuminemia is a relatively rare, autosomal codominant genetic
variant with a slight alteration in the albumin amino acid sequence and presents in capillary electrophoresis with a split albumin fraction. The only disorders which have been directly linked are familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (Arg218AEHis and Arg218AE Pro mutations) and hypertriiodothyroninemia (Leu66AEPro mutation) [22]. In acquired transient bisalbuminemia, the abnormal component of the albumin can be located in the anodal (“fast type”) or cathodal part (“slow type”). A cathodic shoulder on the albumin side is commonly found with massive hyperlipidemia. Other irregularities have been observed with hyperbilirubinemia (presenting with an increased anodal front) [18,24], cirrhosis [25], tryptic digestion (pancreatic pseudo cysts, pancreatitis/malignancy) [26–28], viral infections (for instance mumps), meningococcal meningitis, sepsis or heavy metals intoxication, for instance with copper [18] or application of beta-lactam type antibiotics [28,29]. The exogenous application of sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone or salicylic acid is also a possible cause [18,19]. Aged capillaries may also cause an artefactual cathodal shoulder.
Monoclonal proteins are usually not present in the albumin fraction. One reported case of free monoclonal light chains showed an extragradient between albumin and the alpha-1 band on paper electrophoresis [30].
3.2. Alpha fraction
Acute phase proteins are found in the alpha-fractions. They increase 50–300% in acute inﬂammation and decrease with acute hepatitis, chronic active liver disease or protein loss [19,23].

3.2.1. Alpha-1-fraction Decreases: Alpha1-antitrypsin is the main constituent of the alpha-
1-globulin fraction. Evaluation of the alpha-1-globulin protein fraction usually receives little attention although a decreased fraction frequently indicates alpha-1-antitrypsin deﬁciency. As protein electrophoresis does not diﬀerentiate between alpha-1-antitrypsin deﬁciency and other minor proteins in the alpha-1 fraction, antitrypsin can be more directly and speciﬁcally measured using a nephelometric or immunoturbidimetric method and should be phenotyped for deﬁnitive diagnosis [31,32].
Increases: seen with acute phase response. Irregularities (Fig. 5): Physiological irregularities can originate due to alpha-1-antitrypsin-phenotypic variants; alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) [33] elevations accompanying chronic alcoholism, acute phase response, malignancy, chronic polyarthritis and autoimmune disorders (primary Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus), Crohn's disease. A very high concentration of alpha-fetoprotein has also been reported to cause an extragradient in this region [18,19,26]. Monoclonals: Monoclonal components are extremely rare and are usually light chains [19,23].

3.2.2. Alpha-2-fraction Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin and inhibits its oxidative ac-
tivity. Hemolysis releases free hemoglobin which is bound by haptoglobin. The haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex will be subsequently removed by the reticuloendothelial system. Haptoglobin has been found in all mammals and is produced mostly by hepatic cells. Any inﬂammatory process (infection, extreme stress, burns, major crush injury, allergy, etc.) may increase the level of haptoglobin, because it is an acute phase protein [34].
Alpha-2-macroglobulin is the major component of the alpha-2fraction and produced by the liver. It increases in nephrotic syndrome, which causes the urinary loss of lower molecular weight proteins, including albumin (molecular weight 67 kDa) and IgG (150 kDa), while the large sized alpha-2-macroglobulin (725 kDa) hardly passes through the glomerular ﬁlter. Alpha-2-macroglobulin can than reach serum levels equal to or greater then those of albumin in order to maintain oncotic pressure [35].
Decreases: Haptoglobin can decrease to an undetectable level in intravascular hemolysis [34,37]. Aberrant non-functional forms of alpha-2-macroglobulin have also been reported [38].
Increases: Seen with acute phase response and nephrotic syndrome. Irregularities (Fig. 6): In vitro hemolysis profoundly increases the alpha-2-fraction [39] and irregularities may appear in the cathodic part because of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin-complex (Fig. 7) [19,23]. Other causes are haptoglobin-phenotypic variants which are usually of no pathological signiﬁcance, haptoglobin acute phase elevations (malignancy, Hodgkin's lymphoma, colitis ulcerosa), alpha-2-macroglobulin increase in nephrotic syndrome and exogenous substances, for instance antibiotics or radiopaque agents [16,36].

3.3.1. Beta-1-fraction Decreases: Can be caused by genetic atransferrinemia or iron
overload that leads to transferrin decrease. Increases (Fig. 7): Seen with iron deﬁciency or hemolysis with free
hemoglobin [44]. Irregularities: Hemopexin caused by malignancy or inﬂammation
[45–47]. Exogenous substances, for instance the pre-analytic application of antibiotics or radiopaque agents [16,36].

Monoclonals: Monoclonal proteins in this area have been reported, but are rare [40–43].
3.3. Beta fraction
Capillary electrophoresis allows the separation of two beta fractions, which improves detection of monoclonal proteins [7]. This is the second most frequent location for monoclonal proteins, but other proteins are physiologically present. Monoclonal proteins are prone to alter the fraction shape (asymmetry) or cause an unusual elevation of a fraction (comigration). It is advisable to check any sample with a high beta-1- or beta-2-band with immunoﬁxation, because this will detect a hidden, underlying monoclonal component, even in the absence of any obvious visual abnormality.

3.3.2. Beta-2-fraction Decreases: They are seen with autoimmune disease (active SLE)
and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis which cause complement consumption. Stored samples are subject to in vitro complement degradation.
Increases: Present with IgA increase or an acute phase reaction. A sample with a beta-2 fraction exceeding the beta-1 fraction should be checked by immunoﬁxation for a monoclonal gammopathy.
Irregularities (Fig. 8): Patients under heparin therapy or dialysis occasionally produce blood samples that do not fully clot. Fibrinogen is present in plasma but absent in serum samples. These conditions can cause a visible ﬁbrinogen band between the beta and gamma-globulin region which can mimic presence of a monoclonal protein. Other irregularities are caused by complement [18], stored sample degradation or exogenous substances, for instance the pre-analytic treatment with antibiotics or radiopaque agents [16,48].
Monoclonals: Monoclonal proteins in this area are frequently of the IgA or free light chain type.
3.3.2.1. Beta-gamma Interzone. Increases: IgA monoclonal proteins typically migrate here. A strong polyclonal increase often leads to conﬂuence of the beta-2- and gamma band, called beta-gamma bridging or beta-gamma fusion. This is seen accompanying alcoholism, cirrhosis, respiratory infection, skin disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
Irregularities: One case with an extremely elevated CA 19-9 concentration has been reported [49].
3.4. Gamma fraction
This is the most common area for monoclonals. The immunoglobulins are generally the only proteins present. However, any substance absorbing at 200 nm will be picked up on capillary electrophoresis.
3.4.1. Decrease (hypogammaglobulinemia) Hypogammaglobinemia predicts reduced serum immunoglobulins
(mainly IgG) with a relatively high positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 84% [50]. Usually only a substantial decrease of IgG1, the main IgG constituent, is regularly recognized by a

low total IgG [51,52]. It is seen in common variable immunodeﬁciency (CVID); a decreased antibody production in response to antigenic challenge which is often associated with hematologic and autoimmune disorders and recurrent pyogenic infections. Genetic causes include Xlinked agammaglobulinemia or IgA deﬁciency that occurs with a frequency of 1:500 in the population and is associated in 20% with IgG 2 subclass deﬁciency [19]. It can also occur idiopathically or secondary to a large number of other diseases [53].
8–35% of patients with a monoclonal gammopathy of unknown signiﬁcance (MGUS) have reduced uninvolved polyclonal immunoglobulins (immunoparesis) [54]. This is especially common with light chain myeloma. Consequently, in absence of a discernible M-spike as the only criterion for reﬂexive testing in SPE-negative patients, “the immunoﬁxation positive rate and sensitivity in hypo-gammaglobulinemia were 12.2% and 15.6% respectively, compared to 6.4% and 77.1% in normo-gammaglobulinemia” [50].
3.4.2. Increase (polyclonal elevation) A polyclonal “swell like” gamma elevation indicates an excess of
immunoglobulins, i.e. hypergammaglobulinemia. Polyclonal gammopathies can occur with any reactive or inﬂammatory process, and they are usually associated with nonmalignant conditions. The most common causes are severe infection, acute late stage inﬂammation (acute hepatitis, pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis), chronic inﬂammation, chronic infectious disease (chronically persistent hepatitis), autoimmune disease (collagenosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, other connective tissue disease or lymphoma) [18,19].
Irregularities of discrete to medium severity can be caused by high concentrations of immunoglobulins; especially IgG 4 in patients with IgG 4 associated autoimmune disease [18,55,56]. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporin, tacrolimus) after stem-cell or renal transplantation sometimes present with two noticeable peaks (IgA, IgG) on a low polyclonal background.(author's personal

communication). Diﬀerential diagnosis of pseudo-monoclonal gradients should include extreme elevations of CRP [57], older, degraded samples, presence of uremia, rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes due to liver cirrhosis, malignancy, cardiac and vascular disease, immunoglobulin-lipid-complex, lysozyme (monocyte-leukemia) [58–61], or exogenous substances, for instance pre-analytic application of antibiotics, radiopaque agents or plasma expander therapy [16,19]. Patients on monoclonal antibody therapy may present with irregularities in capillary electrophoresis; the majority of the monoclonal antibodies are visible in the middle of the gamma-globulin region [62].
3.4.3. Oligoclonal bands Oligoclonal bands are deﬁned by several, at least two discrete im-
munoglobulin peaks that migrate closely together during electrophoresis and they appear as narrowly placed peaks on the electrophoretogram. These are most common in the gamma-globulin-region. There is no strict deﬁnition. The most common cause is a chronic stimulation of the immune system or immunosuppression. Oligoclonal bands can be underestimated on the Capillarys® due to the smoothing algorithm of the instrument (Fig. 9), which was not present on an earlier and no longer available instrument, the Beckman CZE, which reﬂects on the discussion between analytical sensitivity and speciﬁty.
3.4.4. Monoclonals Smaller monoclonal gammopathies can also be transient [5]. In one
study, 8.7% of all observed smaller monoclonal gammopathies had no prognostic relevance and were usually associated with infectious diseases [63], especially chronic hepatitis C viral infection [64]. A monoclonal gammopathy is more frequently diagnosed from October to April and a respiratory infection may very well precipitate the diagnosis of a multiple myeloma [65].
There are considerable arguments that these patterns are described as “monoclonal” in low resolution immunoﬁxation and are resolved as “oligoclonal” with the application of higher resolution techniques [17].

3.4.5. CRP elevations High concentrations of CRP may present as an extragradient in the
gamma fraction (Fig. 9) [57,66]. This is a relatively rare condition that was observed only in 1.4% (224 of 15,724 samples) of our own study population. We visually checked 112 samples (CRP between 200 and 300 n = 80, CRP > 300 mg/L, n = 32). 91% showed also an inﬂammatory pattern, i.e. marked increase of the alpha-1-, alpha-2- or both bands (102/112). These samples presented sometimes with a broad elongated elevation starting at the beta-2-fraction. A visible typical extragradient was rare (CRP between 200 and 300: 19% n = 6/ 32, CRP > 300 mg/L: 25% n = 20/80). Most of these smaller changes would have been overlooked. This pattern seems to depend additionally upon the immunoglobulin concentration, especially an inﬂammatory increase of IgM (Table 1).
4. Data visualization
The manual recognition of the changes present in protein electrophoresis is diﬃcult, time-consuming and dependent upon the reviewer. Moreover, protein electrophoresis and other serum and urine laboratory data that supplement each other are frequently requested over a time course and thus presented on diﬀerent output sheets without any apparent association. We designed software that is in daily use and that combines mathematical curve analysis (Figs. 3, 10) with other relevant laboratory values, uses a medical knowledge base to interpret the data and presents the results on a graphical oriented report form (Fig. 11).
The front page prominently features a colorized electrophoresis curve which accentuates the mathematically identiﬁed and manually conﬁrmed monoclonal proteins. Previous curve data is shown as a red line.
These data are automatically complemented with relevant hematological and clinical chemistry values (immunoglobulins, free light chains), provided they have arrived in the laboratory within a 12 hour time period. The values are transformed to percentual multiples of the upper (lower) reference range and colored accordingly. Thus, the constellation of an inconspicuous symmetrical electrophoresis curve with a reduced gamma fraction, diminished immunoglobulins but a relevant increase in free light chains remains distinctively recognizable. The pattern of the increased and decreased electrophoresis fractions is also analyzed and interpreted using entries of a knowledge database.
Up to 6 visits of earlier consultations are summarized on the back page to facilitate patient follow-up. In addition, immunoﬁxation or immunotyping data can be documented and archived online (not shown).
5. Conclusion
Serum protein electrophoresis is a cost-eﬀective, automated method for evaluating the most important proteins and screening for monoclonal proteins. The diagnostic performance characteristic depends decisively on the analytical technique and the quality of the assessment.
