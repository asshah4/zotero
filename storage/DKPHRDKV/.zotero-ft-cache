Mechanisms of Sudden Cardiac Death
Oxidants and Metabolism
Kai-Chien Yang, John W. Kyle, Jonathan C. Makielski, Samuel C. Dudley Jr
Abstract: Ventricular arrhythmia is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Deranged cardiac
metabolism and abnormal redox state during cardiac diseases foment arrhythmogenic substrates through direct or indirect modulation of cardiac ion channel/transporter function. This review presents current evidence on the mechanisms linking metabolic derangement and excessive oxidative stress to ion channel/transporter dysfunction that predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. Because conventional antiarrhythmic agents aiming at ion channels have proven challenging to use, targeting arrhythmogenic metabolic changes and redox imbalance may provide novel therapeutics to treat or prevent life-threatening arrhythmias and SCD.   (Circ Res. 2015;116:19371955.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) refers to death after an unexpected sudden cardiac arrest in a patient with or without known structural heart disease. The incidence of SCD in the United States ranges from 300 000 to 460 000 events per year,1,2 depending on the criteria for SCD used for surveillance. SCD results from a complex interaction between preexisting cardiac substrates, either structural or genetic, with superimposed physiological or environmental triggers. The most common underlying causal disorders for SCD in adults

aged ≥35 are coronary heart disease (65%–80%)2,3 and dilated cardiomyopathy (10%–15%).3 Various types of cardiomyopathy (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, infiltrative, inflammatory, and valvular diseases), genetically determined rhythm disorders (eg, long-QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), or developmental disorders (anomalous origins of coronary arteries) account for most of the remaining SCDs.2,4 The epidemiology

and causes of SCD have been extensively reviewed previously4 and in the articles on epidemiology of sudden cardiac death in this compendium series.
The physiological mechanisms reported to cause SCD vary with the patient population and the criteria used to define SCD.5,6 In general, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, are the most common electrophysiological mechanisms leading to SCD.5,7 Other physiological events that can result in SCD include pulseless electric activity, bradyarrhythmias, and asystole.8,9 This review will focus only on SCDs attributed to ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias, like all cardiac arrhythmias, result from 1 of 3 primary mechanisms: reentry, abnormal automaticity, or triggered activity. Reentry is the most common mechanism for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, involving the presence of an anatomic or functional disturbance of cardiac electric impulse propagation and of heterogeneous conduction. Abnormal automaticity results from the accelerated generation of an action potential by a region of ventricular cells. Triggered activity occurs when an action potential elicits

subsequent depolarizations earlier (early afterdepolarization [EAD]) or later (delayed afterdepolarization [DAD]) in the repolarization phase.
All 3 mechanisms can result from abnormal functioning of myocardial ion channels and transporters, leading to disordered initiation or propagation of cardiac action potentials. Accumulating evidence suggests that altered cardiac ion channel/transporter function is closely linked to abnormal myocardial metabolic activity and imbalanced redox states in a wide range of cardiac pathology. This review presents the current evidence on the acute effects of abnormal myocardial metabolism and increased oxidative stress on myocardial ion channel/transporters that predispose to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. It is important, however, to recognize that abnormal metabolism and oxidative stress in noncardiac myocytes tissues can also contribute to the development of ventricular arrhythmias. For example, altered metabolism and redox state have been implicated in vascular tissue leading to atherosclerosis,10–13 which underlies the main substrate for SCD and coronary heart disease.2,3 Another example is that abnormal metabolism and increased oxidative stress affect autonomic nervous system, thereby contributing to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD.14–17 Within the ventricle, chronic effects of such entities as diabetes mellitus and ischemia from atherosclerosis work through mechanisms involving metabolic and oxidative abnormalities to create the substrate of structural heart diseases that leads to SCD. Both the role of aberrant metabolism and oxidants in the chronic creation of such substrate will not be further considered.
Overview of Cardiac Ionic Channels and Membrane Excitability
Normal functioning of the mammalian heart depends on proper electric activity involving the initiation of the electric impulse from pacemaker cells, the propagation of the electric activity through specialized conduction system and myocardium, and the generation of action potentials in individual myocytes.18,19 A normal cardiac cycle begins with the action potential originating from the cells in sinoatrial node, conducts through the atria, atrioventricular node, His bundle, Purkinje fibers, and then spreads throughout the entire ventricular myocardium.20 The proper propagation of cardiac electric impulse depends on low resistance pathways between cells via gap junctions, which are formed by docking of 2 connexin hemichannels on appositional sarcolemmal membranes.21
Cardiac action potentials are generated through the coordinated activity of various types of ion channels and transporters (Figure 1). Inward current conducting through the voltage-gated Na+ channel rapidly depolarizes the cell (phase 0), which is followed by early repolarization (phase 1) attributed to the transient outward K+ current (Ito). Depolarizing L-type Ca2+ currents (ICaL) and multiple repolarizing delayed rectifier K+ currents (IK) form the plateau phase (phase 2), which is followed by rapid repolarization (phase 3) with inactivated ICaL and increasing IK. The repolarization continues with the contribution of inwardly rectifying K+ current, IK1, until return to the resting membrane potential (phase 4). The Ca2+ influx during the

Figure 1. Action potential (AP) waveform and major ion channels/transporters in human ventricular cardiac myocytess. The AP waveform begins with the activation of Na+ channels (INa), leading to the rapid depolarization (phase 0), followed by inward repolarizing transient outward K+ currents (Ito) in phase 1, forming the notch of the AP waveform. The balance between the inward L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) and outward delayed rectifier K+ currents (IK) contributes to the plateau (phase 2) of the AP waveform. IK continues to repolarize the membrane potential (phase 3) and the inwardly rectifying K+ currents (IK1) contributes to the later part of phase 3 repolarization and the maintenance of resting membrane potential (phase 4). During the AP, Ca2+ influx via ICaL triggers the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), coined Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. During the diastolic phase, SR/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) retrieves cytosolic Ca2+ to SR, and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) extrudes Ca2+ from the cell, bringing cytosolic [Ca2+] back to baseline. Sarcolemmal KATP channels (sarcKATP), gated by intracellular ATP/ADP levels and acidosis, does not contribute to AP waveform under normal circumstances, but play an important role in regulating cellular metabolism and electrophysiological responses to metabolic and oxidative stresses. Na+/K+ ATPase consumes ATP to pump Na+ outside of the cell in exchange for K+, which is critical for the maintenance of Na+ and K+ gradients across the plasma membrane. Cx43 indicates connexin 43.
action potential triggers the opening of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), triggering the release of Ca2+ from SR into the cytosol. Ca2+ then binds to troponin-C of the troponin–tropomyosin complex, resulting in sarcomere longitudinal shortening.
During the diastolic phase, Ca2+ is removed from the cytosol through sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), which pumps cytosolic Ca2+ into SR, as well as Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), an antiporter membrane protein extruding 1 Ca2+ ion from the myocyte in exchange for three Na+ ions. Importantly, the maintenance of Na+ and K+ gradients across the plasma membrane is mediated by the Na+/K+ ATPase, one of the more energy-consuming cellular processes in cardiac myocytess. The energy stored in the resultant electrochemical Na+ gradient and K+ gradient provides the driving

force for many other transporter/exchangers. Conditions that impair the activity of the aforementioned ion channels/transporters can result in abnormal myocardial electric functioning, leading to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD.
Myocardial Metabolism and Energetics
Under physiological conditions, >90% of ATP produced in the cardiac myocytes is supplied by mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and the remainder comes from glycolysis and GTP derived from the tricarboxylic acid cycle.22 As the predominant energy generator in the heart, mitochondria occupy ≈30% of the volume of cardiac myocytess.23 The mitochondria have double-membrane structure (inner and outer membranes) that forms separate compartments, the intermembrane space, and mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria metabolize predominantly fatty acids but can metabolize glucose to generate ATP via OXPHOS. Acetyl-CoA, the metabolic intermediate derived from sequential oxidation of glucose and fatty acid, is used to generate the reducing equivalents, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH ), in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
2
NADH and FADH2 feed electrons to the electron-transport chain (ETC) residing on the mitochondrial inner membrane (Figure 2), where the electrons pass sequentially through complex I, II, III, and IV and finally interact with molecular O to
2
form H2O. Redox reactions occur at complex I, III, and IV, driving proton (H+) from mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. The resulting proton gradient and strongly negative mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm=−150 to −180 mV)24 help to drive H+ flow back to the matrix through mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V), allowing the conversion of ADP to ATP (Figure 2).
In healthy adult myocardium, 60% to 90% of acetyl-CoA comes from β-oxidation of fatty acids, whereas 10% to 40% comes from oxidation of pyruvate derived from glycolysis and lactate oxidation.25,26 Although the majority of cardiac ATP is consumed by the myofilaments, it is estimated that ≈25% of cardiac ATP hydrolysis is used to fuel sarcolemmal and SR ion channels and transporters.27 The critical dependence of cardiac ion channels and transporters on energy supply from metabolized carbon fuels becomes evident under conditions such as myocardial ischemia, during which the mismatch between ATP supply and use can readily disrupt the cardiac rhythm through depleting energy supply to these channels and transporters.28,29
Cardiac Oxidants and Oxidative Stress
In biological systems, partially reduced forms of oxygen (O ) 2
lead to the formation of oxidants or reactive oxygen species (ROS), which oxidize other molecules when these molecules accept electrons. The main ROS in cardiac myocytess exist in radical forms, such as superoxide (O •−) and hydroxyl radicals,
2
or in nonradical forms, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorite, nitric oxide (NO•), and peroxynitrite. It is important to note that although grouped under the acronym of ROS, different reactive species containing molecular oxygen vary greatly in diffusion coefficient, reactivity, and oxidization potential.

Figure 2. Oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria. The diagrams of the mitochondrial inner membrane show key components of the electron transport chain (ETC) above, and channels and transporters (below). Reducing equivalents nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) produced from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle feed electrons to the ETC along the mitochondrial inner membrane. The electrons flow through the ETC with the following sequence: complex I and II→coenzyme Q [Q]→complex III→cytochrome C [Cyt C]→complex IV→O2, during which coupled redox reactions drive H+ across the inner membrane, forming the proton gradient and the negative mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm=−150 to −180 mV). The free energy stored in the proton gradient and ∆Ψm then drive H+ through the mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V), converting ADP to ATP. An estimated 0.1% to 1% of the electrons leak prematurely to O2 at complexes I, II, or III, resulting in the formation of superoxide (O2•−). Multiple important mitochondrial channels located on the inner membrane including mitochondrial KATP channels (mito-KATP), the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mito-NCX), the inner membrane anion channel (IMAC), the permeability transition pore (PTP), and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) also contribute to the regulation of mitochondrial function, myocardial ROS, and cellular cation homeostasis.

Under physiological conditions, trace amounts of signaling ROS, which are tightly regulated by the balance of ROS production and ROS scavengers, form a network that coordinates metabolism with gene transcription and enzymatic activity.30,31 Low levels of ROS produced during short periods of ischemia, for example, trigger signaling pathways that confer cardiac protection, a phenomenon coined ischemic preconditioning (IPC), which is mediated, at least in part, through mitochondrial K channels (see below).32 In addition, low levels
ATP
of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2–mediated ROS production sensitizes nearby RyRs and triggers Ca2+ sparks in cardiac myocytess in response to physiological stretch with increased preload33 and afterload,34 a process termed X-ROS signaling. Excessive ROS leads to detrimental reactions with cellular lipids and proteins, eliciting maladaptive responses and other abnormalities that compromise cellular and tissue functions, ultimately leading to cell death.35–37 The deleterious effects caused by excessive ROS are defined as oxidative stress.
The main sources of ROS in cardiac myocytess include NADPH oxidases, xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and mitochondria.38,39 Figure 3 illustrates the major ROS synthesis pathways in cardiac myocytess. NADPH oxidases are membrane-bound enzymes that use NADH or

NADPH as the electron donor to generate O2•− from O2.40 Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine/ xanthine and produces O .•− 41 NOS, on the contrary, produces
2
a single nitrogen radical (NO•) through metabolizing l-argi-
nine to l-citrulline. NOS becomes uncoupled under condi-
tions such as depletion of l-arginine, oxidation of the NOS
cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, or increased S-glutathionylation of NOS. Under these conditions, NOS produces O •− instead
2
of NO•.42,43 NO• itself is a weak thiol oxidant, but it regulates
various physiological functions by activating cGMP/protein
kinase G (PKG) pathways or by covalent modification of pro-
tein cysteine residues via S-nitrosylation or S-glutathiolation (GSS-);44,45 NO• also reacts with O2•− and forms a more potent oxidative molecule peroxynitrite. Oxidative molecules derived from NO•, such as NO2•, N2O3, and peroxynitrite, are termed reactive nitrogen species.44,45 As the metabolic hub in
cardiac myocytess, mitochondria consume most of the O2 in cardiac myocytess for energy production, thereby serving as
the major source of ROS in the heart.
In the mitochondria, ROS are generated as an inevitable
byproduct of OXPHOS, resulting from the premature leak
of electrons from the ETC to molecular oxygen. It has been
estimated that 0.1% to 1% of the electrons passing through
the ETC prematurely leak to O at complexes I, II, or III, 2

Figure 3. Major reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation pathways in cardiac myocytes. Mitochondria represent the predominant source of ROS in cardiac myocytess, producing superoxide (O2•−) by the premature leak of electrons from the respiratory chain at complexes I, II, or III. Mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase can dismutate O2•− to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can be broken down by transition metals such as Fe2+ and converted to hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Superoxide can also be generated by the reduction of O2 by free electrons released from (1) NAD(P)H oxidases, which oxidize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to form NAD+ or NADP+, (2) xanthine oxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine or xanthine to uric acid, (3) endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which switches from a coupled state (producing NO•) to an uncoupled oxide (producing O2•−) under conditions such as the reduction in l-arginine, the deficiency of cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), or increased glutathionylation of eNOS. Superoxide can also interact with preformed NO• and generate peroxynitrite ONOO−.

leading to O2•− formation (Figure 2).46 The ROS production rate in the mitochondria is accelerated by increased proton

motive force, by the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, by the

increased ratio of reduced coenzyme Q10 to coenzyme Q10,

or when the O2 concentration is raised above physiological levels.47,48 Paradoxically, mitochondrial ROS production also

increases under condition of low local O2 concentration.47,49 Mitochondrial O2•− is converted to H2O2 and O2 by manga-
nese superoxide dismutase, the primary antioxidant enzyme

in mitochondria.50 H O is then converted to H O and O by

cytosolic and mitochondrial scavenging enzymes, glutathi-

one peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, and catalase. The emission

of mitochondrial ROS is determined by the tight balance be-

tween the redox-dependent ROS production and elimination.

The concept of redox-optimized redox balance implies that a

reduced mitochondrial redox state (high NADH) not only fa-

vors mitochondrial ROS production but also at the same time

optimizes ROS elimination through NADPH-dependent ROS

scavenging system, such as glutathione and thioredoxin.51

Cardiac mitochondria are optimized to keep ROS emission at

minimum by operating at an intermediate redox state, where

ROS emission is highest under oxidized or reduced condi-

tions.51,52 During conditions with marked oxidation (such as

heart failure), depletion of the antioxidative capacity leads

to excessive ROS outflow in spite of reduced O •− produc2
tion from the ETC, whereas during highly reduced conditions

(such as ischemia), excessive O •− production from the ETC 2
overwhelms the antioxidative capacity, in spite of the abun-

dant NADPH levels.51–53

Figure 4. Effects of metabolic stresses on cardiac ion channel/transporter function. Schematic illustration of the impact of acute (ischemia/hypoxia) and chronic (heart failure and diabetes mellitus) metabolic stresses on cardiac ion channel/ transporter function and the electrophysiological consequences. Acidosis during acute ischemia leads to opening of sarcKATP channels, increased activity of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), and increased late Na+-current (INa). ATP depletion during ischemia contributes to the opening of sarcKATP channels, as well as impairs the function of Na/K ATPase. Other electrophysiological effects from ischemia include the reduction of peak INa, increased connexin (Cx) conduction, and reduced ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) activity. Reduced RyR2 activity during acute ischemia is rapidly reversed on reperfusion, contributing to the spontaneous waves of Ca2+ release and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). A few examples of electrophysiological impact from chronic metabolic stresses associated with heart failure and diabetes mellitus are also illustrated: heart failure reduces peak INa and multiple Kv (I , I ) currents. Diabetes mellitus is also associated
to K
with reduction in Kv currents. The increase in sarcKATP currents lead to action potential duration (APD) shortening, whereas reduced Kv currents and increased late INa lead to prolonged APD and early afterdepolarizations (EADs). Finally, reduced Na/K ATPase activity, increased RyR2 activity, and increased gap junction conduction during ischemia predispose to arrhythmogenic DADs.
The mitochondrial ETC efficiency is impaired under pathological conditions, such as myocardial ischemia54,55 and heart failure,56,57 resulting in increased electron leak and
ROS production. Accumulating ROS levels trigger the open-
ing of mitochondrial channels, including mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP)58 and inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) (Figure 2),59 leading to depolarization of the
∆Ψm and further acceleration of ROS production, a phenomenon termed mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release.60–62
The PTP is a nonselective channel residing on the inner mi-
tochondrial membrane, and it opens with elevated matrix [Ca2+], increased ROS and phosphate levels, and by reduced

mechanism to prevent overt mitochondrial cation (especially

Ca2+) and ROS accumulation.64 During myocardial ischemia,

myocytes experience Ca2+ overload, high phosphate and low

ATP concentrations. These conditions prime PTP for opening

Ca2+ accumulation, leading to prolonged PTP opening and

burst ROS release from mitochondria.63,64 Pharmacological

inhibition of PTP (with cyclosporine A or sanglifehrin A) pro-

dimers of mitochondrial ATP-synthase form the pore-forming

component of PTP,67 and the c subunit of the ATP-synthase

complex may be required for PTP-dependent mitochondrial

fragmentation and cell death.68 IMAC, on the contrary, is re-

sponsible for anionic currents across the mitochondrial mem-

brane, allowing the passage of O •− generated by ETC from the 2

permeability of IMAC, resulting in a burst in ROS release and

∆Ψm depolarization. The resulting reversible ∆Ψm collapse and membrane potential oscillation foster lethal ventricular

arrhythmias, which can be abrogated by IMAC inhibitors.69

During mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release, depolarized

mitochondrial ∆Ψm depletes NADPH (the level of which is coupled to [NADH] by nicotinamide nucleotide transhydroge-

nase in mitochondria), thereby leading to rapid dissipation

of ROS-eliminating capacity, allowing acceleration of ROS

emission from mitochondria.51,60–62

Elevated mitochondrial ROS also impairs ATP production

through various mechanisms. Excessive ROS cause oxida-

tive damage to components of the ETC, such as complex I,

II,70 IV,71 and ATP synthase,70 impairing ATP generation and

further aggravate electron leakage. In addition, O •− activates 2
mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, resulting in increased

electron leak and uncoupled O consumption from ATP syn2
thesis.72,73 Taken together, excessive cardiac ROS leads to ab-

normal electric function directly by ROS-mediated signaling

and oxidative damage, as well as indirectly by decreasing ATP

generation that is required for normal ion channel/transporters

functioning.28,29

Impaired cardiac metabolism and increased myocardial

oxidative stress, depending on the cause and clinical course,

can be divided into 2 categories: acute and chronic. Acute

cardiac oxidative and metabolic derangements typically oc-

cur with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion that results from

coronary artery occlusion. Chronic oxidative and metabolic

abnormalities, in contrast, occur with conditions such as car-

diac hypertrophy, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. The

impact of chronic oxidative and metabolic stresses on cardiac

electrophysiology often involves changes in the transcript

and protein expression of cardiac ion channels/transporters,

which is commonly defined as electric remodeling.74 Electric

remodeling during these chronic cardiac conditions have

been extensively reviewed elsewhere.74,75 Aside from a few

exceptions, therefore, this review will focus on the effects of acute myocardial metabolic and oxidative stress on cardiac electrophysiology.
Mechanisms Linking Impaired Cardiac Metabolism to Ventricular Arrhythmias and SCD
Metabolic Regulation of Cardiac Ca2+ Handling and Homeostasis Calcium ions are critical intracellular signaling molecules, responsible for the regulation of numerous cellular processes in cardiac myocytess, including excitation–contraction coupling, gene transcription, enzyme activity, and cell death.76 The intracellular [Ca2+] concentration fluctuates markedly between systole and diastole, yet the changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] are tightly regulated. Multiple signaling molecules, including calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), PKA, and PKC, are involved in the regulation of these Ca2+ handling proteins (see review by Bers76). Impaired Ca2+ homeostasis and handling have been implicated in the mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis observed in acute myocardial ischemia,77,78 as well as in chronic cardiac conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy79,80 and heart failure.81,82
During myocardial ischemia or metabolic inhibition, various metabolic parameters are markedly altered in cardiac myocytess. For example, ATP levels decrease, cells become progressively acidic with elevated lactate levels,83 and the levels of phosphate84 and magnesium85 increase. Both reduced ATP and elevated phosphate levels can inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase activity,86,87 leading to intracellular Na+ accumulation. Increased late Na+-currents (late I ) also contributes to in-
Na
creased intracellular [Na+] during myocardial ischemia88–90 and heart failure.91 Elevated intracellular [Na+] leads to increased cytosolic [Ca2+], at least in part, through decreased extrusion of Ca2+ or through actual Ca2+ entry with NCX activity in the reverse mode (Na+ out and Ca2+ in).92–94 The activity of SR Ca2+ uptake (through SERCA) and release (through RyR2) are both inhibited during myocardial ischemia28; however, RyR2 inhibition seems to predominate over reduced SERCA activity during ischemia, reflected in lower frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ release through RyR228, 95 and increased SR Ca2+ load.28 On reperfusion or reoxygenation, RyR2 is released from inhibition, producing spontaneous waves of Ca2+ release,96 which may contribute to calcium transient/action potential alternans and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 4; Table 1).97,98
In addition to the ATP production machinery, mitochondria also harbor Ca2+ channels and transporters, allowing the transfer of Ca2+ ions between cytosol and mitochondria, thereby contributing to the dynamic regulation of sarcolemmal Ca2+ homeostasis. Mitochondria uptake Ca2+ predominantly through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and extrude Ca2+ mainly through the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Figure 2).99,100 The capacity of Ca2+ uptake and release by mitochondria forms an additional buffer for cytosolic Ca2+ regulation, contributing to the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca2+ signaling in cardiac cells.101,102 Nevertheless, it remains debatable how much mitochondria contribute to cellular Ca2+

dynamics under physiological and pathological conditions.103 Recently, Williams et al102 provide quantitative data, suggesting that mitochondria do not function as a significant buffer of cytosolic Ca2+ under physiological conditions, with prolonged elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+]; however, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can increase ≤1000-fold and affect cellular Ca2+ dynamics significantly.102 Nevertheless, it has been shown that mitochondrial dysfunction results in cardiac myocytes Ca2+ transient alternans by impairing the mitochondrial capacity of Ca2+ handling, thereby predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias.104 In addition, pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial uptake through mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter with Ru360 has been shown to reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias induced by ischemia-reperfusion in the rodent heart.105 As the metabolic center in cardiac myocytess, therefore, mitochondria play an important role in transducing changes in cardiac metabolic states to the dynamic regulation of sarcolemmal Ca2+, membrane excitability, and electric functioning.
Metabolic Regulation of Na+ Homeostasis and Na+ Channel Function Intracellular [Na+] plays a critical role in regulating the energetics, electric functioning, and contractility of cardiac myocytes, which can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of cytosolic [Na+] on Ca2+ homeostasis,92 mitochondrial function,106 and cellular signaling.107 Multiple ion channels/transporters function to maintain the [Na+] homeostasis in cardiac myocytess: Na+/K+ ATPase, for example, consumes ATP to pump Na+ outside of the cell in exchange of K+, representing the main mechanism of Na+ efflux, whereas Na+ channels, NCX and the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) mediate Na+ influx in cardiac myocytess.
Cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channels form by the assembly of a pore-forming α subunit and auxiliary β subunits that modulate channel activities. Nav1.5 (SCN5A) is the predominant Nav α subunit expressed in the mammalian myocardium. Currents conducting through Na+ channels generate the rapid upstroke (phase 0) of the action potential. In addition, Na+ channels, together with cardiac gap junctions, govern the electric conduction velocity in the myocardium. There are 2 effects of Na+ channel/transporter dysfunction on

arrhythmogenesis: (1) through affecting Na+-Ca2+ homeostasis, thereby promoting delayed afterdepolarizations and creating reentry substrates and (2) through electrophysiological effects of the channel function. For example, increased late INa predisposes to action potential duration (APD) prolongation and EADs, both of which are arrhythmogenic and predispose to SCD (Table 1; Figure 4).
During the metabolic stress that ensues with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, reduced Na+/K+ ATPase (because of reduced ATP and elevated ADP/phosphate levels), increased late I (see below for detailed mechanisms),108 and enhanced
Na
NHE (owing to increased cytosolic acidosis) activity109,110 result in increased cytosolic [Na+], thereby leading to Ca2+ overload and increased propensity for ventricular arrhythmias (see above). It has been shown that pharmacological inhibition or knockout of NHE renders cardiac function resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury.111
In addition to altered Na+/K+ ATPase and NHE function, it has been demonstrated that ischemia/metabolic inhibition can trigger Na+ influx through connexin hemichannels.112,113 Under normal conditions, connexin hemichannels located on adjacent intercellular sarcolemmal membranes combine to form gap junctions at the intercalated discs between cardiac myocytess. During ischemia/metabolic inhibition, connexin hemichannels localize to the nonjunctional membrane, turning into nonselective cation channels that are permeable to Na+, K+, and Ca2+.112,114 With the high conductance of these connexin hemichannels, it is suggested that the opening of even a small number of connexin 43 hemichannels can lead to doubling of Na+ influx in ventricular cardiac myocytes,114,115 contributing to increased Na+ load and increased propensity for arrhythmias (Table 1; Figure 4).
Elevated cytosolic [Na+] also impairs cardiac metabolism reciprocally through affecting mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial [Na+] is regulated by NHE-mediated Na+ uptake116 and mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger–mediated Na+ efflux.117 Under physiological conditions, energized mitochondria extrude H+, and the resulting pH gradient drives the Na+ gradient between mitochondrial matrix (lower [Na+]) and cytosol (higher [Na+]).116,118 Intracellular Na+ levels increase significantly in pathological conditions, such as myocardial

ischemia.109 The rise in cytosolic [Na+] during ischemia widens the Na+ gradient across mitochondria, leading to stronger driving force for Ca2+ extrusion from mitochondria via mitochondrial Na+–Ca2+ exchanger, thereby leading to reduced mitochondrial [Ca2+] and altered mitochondrial energetics,100,106 including decreased activities of Ca2+-dependent dehydrogenases in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the net oxidation of the matrix NADH/NADPH pool, and hence the deficiency of NADPH-dependent ROS scavengers, thereby increasing mitochondrial ROS emission.119,120 Increased ROS levels further aggravate cytosolic Na+ accumulation by increasing late I
Na
through direct Na+ channel modification121,122 or by activating signaling molecules such as PKC123 or CaMKII (see below).124 Therefore, there may be a feed-forward mechanism between increased cytosolic [Na+], impaired mitochondrial metabolism, increased ROS emission, and ROS-induced elevation of cytosolic [Na+].125
In addition to cytosolic [Na+], cardiac metabolism also influences electric functioning through modulating sarcolemmal Na+ channel activity.126 During myocardial ischemia, various metabolic derangements result in altered Na+ channel properties and function. The ischemic metabolite lysophosphatidylcholine, for example, has been shown to decrease peak Na+ current (peak I ) and to slow its inac-
Na
tivation.127 In addition, lysophosphatidylcholine also causes a marked increase in late I , thereby increasing myocardial
Na
Na+ loading.88 Myocardial acidosis during ischemia is also known to affect the inactivation states of Na+ channel, leading to increased late INa (Table 1; Figure 4).89,90 Cardiac Na+ channels are reported to be modulated by AMP-activated PK (AMPK). AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by increased cytosolic AMP/ATP ratio to increase ATP production and decrease ATP consumption, thereby functioning as a master metabolic regulator in cardiac myocytes.128,129 Mutations in PRKAG2 gene, which encodes the γ2 subunit of AMPK, have been reported to be associated with electric instability and lethal ventricular arrhythmias.130–132 For example, PRKAG2 T172D, a constitutively active AMPK mutant, has been shown to slow Na+ channels inactivation, leading to increased late I , prolonged APD and arrhythmo-

genic EADs130
Metabolic Regulation of K+ Channels and Cardiac Repolarization Various types of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels and nonvoltage-gated inwardly rectifying channels contribute to myocardial action potential repolarization.19,20 Under pathological conditions, such as myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure, repolarizing Kv currents in ventricular cardiac myocytess are reduced, leading to delayed repolarization and prolonged APD, which predispose to the development of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD (Figure 4).20
Among several types of inwardly rectifying K+ channels functioning in mammalian heart, IK1 contributes to the terminal phase of repolarization and the maintenance of resting membrane potentials in ventricular myocytes,20,133,134 whereas currents conducted via sarcolemmal KATP (sarcKATP) channels, gated by intracellular ATP/ADP levels and acidosis,135 function as immediate sensors of cellular metabolism and play an

essential role in electrophysiological responses to metabolic stresses such as myocardial ischemia.136,137
Abnormal cardiac repolarization, including QT-interval prolongation and T-wave abnormalities, are often observed in patients with diabetes mellitus, one of the leading chronic metabolic disorders associated with ventricular arrhythmias and SCD.138,139 Studies on cellular mechanisms of diabetes mellitus–induced repolarization abnormalities have consistently revealed downregulation of cardiac Kv currents in diabetic heart.140–142 Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to account for reduced Kv currents during diabetes mellitus. First, post-translational inhibition of Kv channel function occurs in diabetes mellitus. Plasma levels of free fatty acid metabolites, such as palmitoylcarnitine and palmitoyl-CoA, are increased with diabetes mellitus. They have been shown to inhibit cardiac Kv currents directly.143 Acute treatment with insulin has been demonstrated to reverse diabetes mellitus– induced Kv current reduction, suggesting the primary role of insulin-dependent signaling on Kv channel function.140 It has been suggested that improved glucose utilization by insulin may be responsible for restored Kv current expression because compounds known to improve glucose utilization (such as dicholoroacetate or l-carnitine) have been shown to normalize cardiac Kv current density with diabetes mellitus.141 Increased ROS levels also contribute to reduced cardiac Kv currents during diabetes mellitus, and direct incubation with antioxidant glutathione has been shown to restore Kv current expression in myocytes isolated from diabetic hearts.140 Second, transcriptional regulation of Kv channel expression may reduce Kv currents. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, a critical regulator of glucose/fatty acid metabolism, is upregulated in diabetic heart and has been suggested to transcriptionally repress cardiac Kv channel expression.144 Cardiac-specific overexpression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor α downregulates the mRNA and protein expression levels of Kv4.2 and KChIP2, the channel subunits encoding I ,144 whereas peroxisome proliferator-acti-
to
vated receptor α knockout upregulates Ito.144 Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase α, a key component of insulin receptor signaling pathway that can be triggered by insulin treatment or exercise training, upregulates mRNA levels of various Kv channels145,146 through an Akt-independent mechanism,147 which may provide the mechanistic explanation for insulinmediated Kv current modulation, as well as the metabolic impact of exercise training on cardiac repolarization. It is important to note that the changes in Kv current observed with diabetes mellitus or exercise training reflect the chronic effects of metabolic stress on Kv channel remodeling, rather than acute channel effects.
The sarcKATP channels are present at high density in the sarcolemmal membrane. SarcKATP channels are inhibited by ATP and activated by ADP, Mg2+, or low pH, conditions that are associated with ischemia, insufficient fuel supply, and increased metabolic stress.148 On increased metabolic stress with ATP depletion and acidosis (eg, during myocardial ischemia),149 sarcKATP channels are activated, allowing an inwardly rectifying repolarizing K+ current. SarcK channels open

within seconds in response to acute ischemia, which is likely
attributed to the rapid drop in pH (also within seconds of ischemia) in the ischemic tissue.150 ATP levels, by contrast, deplete
at a slower rate and remain in the millimolar range (levels that
are sufficient to keep sarcKATP channels closed) until 10 to 15 minutes after the onset of ischemia.151 Therefore, ATP deple-
tion may not contribute to sarcKATP channel opening during the early phase of ischemia.
The cell surface expression density of sarcK channels ATP
is high. It has been estimated that the opening of merely 1%
of the sarcK channels is sufficient to significantly shorten ATP
myocardial APD.152 The opening of sarcK channels shortATP
ens APD and decreases inward Ca2+ currents, thereby reducing Ca2+-mediated cardiac energy consumption and preventing Ca2+ overload-induced cell death. With adequate numbers of
sarcKATP channels in the open state, however, cardiac myocytes become hyperpolarized and rendered unexcitable.153
This creates a current sink that slows or blocks electric propa-
gation in the myocardium, predisposing to the development of ventricular arrhythmia (Table 1; Figure 4).62,154 Indeed, phar-
macological inhibition of sarcKATP channels has been shown to reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in animal models155–157 and in humans.158–160 Reduced mitochondrial ATP
production with impaired respiratory chain function leads to
the activation of sarcK channels. During ROS-induced ATP
ROS release, for example, dissipation of ∆Ψm results in cessation of mitochondrial ATP production, leading to sarcK
ATP
activation, altered myocyte APDs and even ventricular arrhythmias.59,62,161 Interestingly, it has been shown that ATP
generated from glycolysis plays a bigger role in modulating sarcKATP activity than ATP generated from OXPHOS,162 which is in accordance with recent findings that the key glycolytic
enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase (GAPDH) and pyruvate kinase, serve as components
of the sarcKATP channel macrocomplex and regulate its function.163,164 SarcK channels have also been shown to exhibit
ATP
reduced sensitivity to ATP-mediated inhibition in diabetic
heart, resulting in higher sarcK conductance and greater ATP
APD shortening in response to hypoxia.165
Non–Ion Channel Mechanisms Linking Metabolism to Ventricular Arrhythmias and SCD As mentioned above, AMPK functions as a key metabolic sen-
sor and regulator in cardiac myocytess. It has been reported that specific mutations in PRKAG2, the γ2 regulatory subunit of AMPK, lead to a glycogen storage cardiomyopathy
characterized by ventricular pre-excitation and cardiac hypertrophy.166,167 The structural abnormalities associated with
PRKAG2 mutations, including the glycogen accumulation
and ventricular hypertrophy, result in abnormal conduction that predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias.166,167 In addition to
AMPK, patients with inherited fatty acid oxidation disorders
exhibit high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, conduction defects and SCD,168 which can be attributed to the accumu-
lation of arrhythmogenic intermediary metabolites of fatty acids.168 Fatty acid metabolites, such as lysophosphatidylcho-
line, accumulate during myocardial ischemia, contributing to the formation of arrhythmogenic substrates.88 Consistent with
these findings, a transgenic mouse model of cardiac-specific

overexpression of fatty acid transport protein 1 (α-MHC FATP1) has been shown to exhibit increased myocardial uptake and accumulation of free fatty acids, leading to arrhythmogenic electric changes including QT prolongation.169 Taken together, these data suggest that abnormal cardiac metabolism can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD through non–ion channel mechanisms.

Mechanisms Linking Increased Cardiac Oxidative Stress to Ventricular
Arrhythmias and SCD

Myocardial Oxidative Stress and Cardiac Na+

Channels

Abnormal cardiac Na+ channel function is often observed in

cardiac diseases, such as myocardial ischemia170,171 and heart

failure,91,172 conditions that are associated with increased car-

diac oxidative stress. Na+ channel abnormalities can be cat-

egorized as loss- or gain-of function. Loss-of-function Na+

channel abnormality leads to reduced peak I , resulting in Na
conduction block that potentiates re-entrant type ventricular

arrhythmias.173 Gain-of-function Na+ channel abnormality, in

contrast, results in the increase in late INa, which can lead to prolongation of APDs, EADs, reverse mode NCX transport,

and subsequent Ca2+ overload in sarcomere, all of which pre-

dispose to ventricular arrhythmias.122,174

ROS have been demonstrated to affect Na+ channel

function through multiple mechanisms. Transcriptionally,

ROS have been shown to reduce Nav1.5 channel expression

by reducing mRNA expression.175,176 At the protein level,

ROS have been shown to impair Nav1.5 channel inactiva-

tion through direct oxidation at the methionine residues of

Nav1.5 channel protein.177 Elevated mitochondrial ROS are

known to reduce peak INa by modifying Nav1.5 conductance through post-translational mechanisms without affecting

cell surface expression of Nav1.5.57 The slowly inactivating

component of Na+ current (late I ), on the contrary, is known Na
to be augmented by ROS in cardiac myocytess.121,122,174 For

example, increased H2O2 has been shown to increase the open probabilities of Na+ channel, leading to increased late

and

changes

including

prolonga-

tion of APDs, EADs, and cytosolic Ca2+ overload (Figure 5;

Table 2).122,174 In addition to direct ROS-dependent effects

on Na+ channels, ROS also modulate Na+ channel activi-

ties indirectly by altering membrane lipid environment178

or by activating signaling molecules, such as PKC123 or

CaMKII.124 Elevated mitochondrial ROS activate PKC, for

example, which may reduce peak I by affecting Nav1.5 Na
phosphorylation. ROS-induced CaMKIIδ activation, on the

contrary, has been shown to mediate H2O2-induced increases in late INa.124
Increased myocardial oxidative stress is often associated

with impaired cardiac metabolism. The cardiac NADH level,

for example, is elevated during cardiac ischemia and cardiomy-

opathy, which leads to increased mitochondrial ROS production

and reduced peak INa. Using a mouse model of non–ischemic cardiomyopathy, we have demonstrated recently that the cyto-

solic NADH and mitochondrial ROS levels are increased with

cardiomyopathy, resulting in a cardiac peak I reduction without Na

Figure 5. Effects of increased oxidative stress on cardiac ion channel/transporter function. Schematic figure to demonstrate the impact of increased oxidative stress on cardiac ion channel/ transporter function. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) enhance the activity of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) and sarcKATP channels and increase late INa. Excessive oxidative stress reduces peak INa and repolarizing K+ currents (transient outward K+ current [Ito], delayed rectifier K+ currents [IK], and IK1) and leads to reduced gap junction protein connexin (Cx) 43 and reduced sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity. Increased ROS inhibit normal operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX; Na+ in, Ca2+ out) and promote the reverse mode of NCX activity (Na+ out, Ca2+ in). The increase in sarcKATP currents lead to action potential duration (APD) shortening, whereas reduced Kv currents and increased late INa lead to prolonged APD and early afterdepolarizations (EADs). Increased RyR2 activity, reduced SERCA function, and reverse mode NCX activity lead to cytosolic Ca2+ overload and predispose to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs).
altering membrane Na+ channel protein expression levels.57 The
reduced peak I can be restored by mitochondrial antioxidants Na
NAD+ or Mito-TEMPO [(2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl) oxyl] treatment.57 Consistent with these findings, NAD+
treatment has been shown to improve myocardial conduction
abnormality that is associated with reduced peak I in human Na
failing heart.57
The link between mitochondrial ROS and I regulation is Na
also observed in the hereditary arrhythmia syndromes. One of
the Brugada syndrome–causing mutations, A280V mutation
in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1–like protein, has
been demonstrated to reduce peak I by increasing cytosolic Na
NADH levels and mitochondrial ROS.123,179 Peak I reduction Na
by A280V glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1–like is abrogated by the treatment of NAD+ or Mito-TEMPO.123 Taken
together, these data suggest the important role of mitochon-
drial ROS in transducing the altered cardiac metabolic states (NADH/NAD+ levels) to the regulation of cardiac Na+ chan-
nels and membrane excitability.

During acute ischemia, myocardial NO• production is enhanced owing to increased NOS (especially eNOS) activity180 and conversion of tissue nitrate to NO•.181 Increased NO• production and elevated NOS activities play a critical role in the cardioprotective effects of IPC (see Myocardial ROS and Potassium Channels Section of this article), which has been extensively reviewed previously.182,183 Elevated NO• has been shown to increase late INa,184 which can be abolished by reducing agents glutathione and DTT,184,185 suggesting that NO• modulates Na+ channel activities by oxidizing Na+ channel or its regulatory proteins. Interestingly, others report that NO• decreases peak INa through reducing the open probability and the surface expression of functional Na+ channels, which are mediated indirectly through a PKG/PKA-dependent pathway.186 Peroxynitrite, formed by NO• and O •− interaction, has also

been shown to augment late I 187 Na.
Cardiac Redox State and Ca2+ Homeostasis As mentioned earlier in this review, intracellular [Ca2+] is tightly regulated by various Ca2+-handling proteins, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, SERCA, RyR2, NCX, and signaling molecules such as CaMKII, PKA, and PKC. Many of these Ca2+-handling and regulatory proteins harbor methionines or thiol groups that are susceptible to the direct modification by ROS or reducing agents, thereby sensitive to the altered redox states during cardiac diseases.
In general, elevated ROS levels in cardiac myocytess are known to result in a net increase in intracellular [Ca2+].188 The direct application of H2O2 or increased mitochondrial ROS has been shown to increase ICaL and its sensitivity to isoproterenol stimulation in ventricular myocytes.189 In addition, oxidized low-density lipoprotein has been demonstrated to stimulate I through lysophosphatidylcholine-induced mitochondrial
CaL
ROS.190 Nevertheless, there are conflicting reports showing reduced cardiac I in the presence of elevated oxidative
CaL
stress.191,192 The discrepant findings in the effects of ROS on cardiac I may be explained by the differences in the experi-
CaL
mental design, animal species, and type of ROS involved. The results on the impact of increased oxidative stress on
other Ca2+-handling proteins, in contrast, are more consistent. Excessive ROS increases the open probability of RyR2, enhancing the release of Ca2+ from SR.193 Calcium sparks from RyR2 are increased in response to photoactivated or chemicalinduced mitochondrial ROS.194 In contrast to RyR2, SERCA activity is reduced on increased cardiac ROS,195–197 which can be, at least in part, attributed to reduced ATP supply for SERCA pump owing to mitochondrial dysfunction.38 Cardiac NCX, which normally extrudes Ca2+ from cytosol in exchange for Na+, has been shown to be activated in the reverse mode by increased oxidative stress, thereby increasing cytosolic [Ca2+] (Table 2; Figure 5).198,199
CaMKII is activated by ROS, and it is known to play a critical role in regulating calcium-handling proteins in response to increased cardiac oxidative stress.200 For example, activated CaMKII augments ICaL by phosphorylating Cav1.2 channel subunit and increasing its open probability.201 Phosphorylation of RyR2 by CaMKII increases SR Ca2+ leak, promoting cytosolic Ca2+ overload and delayed afterdepolarizations.200 Taken together, the net impact of increased oxidative stress

on Ca2+-handling proteins leads to cytosolic Ca2+ overload and depletion of SR Ca2+ store, resulting in detrimental changes, such as arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations and contractile dysfunction.
As discussed earlier in this review, mitochondria also play an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ in cardiac myocytess. Increased oxidative stress is known to modulate mitochondrial [Ca2+] by altering mitochondrial ion channel activities, contributing to the perturbation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis. For example, increased ROS during myocardial ischemia depolarize ∆Ψm,202 forcing mitochondrial NCX into reverse mode and drives Ca2+ from cytosol into mitochondria.117,203 Physiologically, mitochondrial Ca2+ is required for normal ETC function and serves as a positive effector of OXPHOS. Ca2+ overload, however, leads to increased mitochondrial ROS production through mechanisms including increased electron leakage,204,205 enhanced NO• production, which is known to inhibit complex IV and augment ROS production from complex III,206 and reduced cytochrome c–mediated respiration.207,208 In addition, pathological mitochondrial Ca2+ overload has been shown to increase NO• and ROS production in cardiac myocytess.209 These data suggest a positive feedback loop between ROS-induced Ca2+-overload and Ca2+-induced ROS production. Under pathological conditions, such as myocardial ischemia, cellular and mitochondrial [Ca2+] increase, leading to increased ROS production. ROS overproduction induced by elevated mitochondrial [Ca2+] results in further increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ and ROS levels. The Ca2+ load and ROS produced from this positive feed-forward loop can overwhelm the cellular capacity of ROS scavenging and Ca2+ clearance, resulting in cellular damage and electric instability that predispose to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD.210 It is worth noting that during heart failure, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake/accumulation is actually reduced (because accumulated cytosolic Na+ during heart failure inhibits mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via activation of mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger),119,120 which

also favors ROS production (by impairing mitochondrial energetics and oxidizing NAD(P)H).119,120
NO• and peroxynitrite also play important roles in modulating cardiac Ca2+ channel and Ca2+-handling proteins. Increased NO• inhibits L-type Ca2+ channel activity through increased S-nitrosylation211,212 and cGMP-PKG-dependent phosphorylation213 of Ca2+ channel subunits, which may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of IPC by limiting Ca2+ influx during ischemia.212 The effects of NO• on RyR2 is concentration dependent. Physiological NO• levels (≈1 μmol/L) do not affect RyR2 activity, whereas supraphysiological levels (≥100 μmol/L) inhibit RyR2 activity.214 Peroxynitrite, on the contrary, activates RyR2 by oxidizing its cysteine residues.214 SERCA2a, by contrast, is inhibited by peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration. PKA pretreatment can prevent the inhibitory effects of peroxynitrite on SERCA2a by inducing dissociation of phospholamban from SERCA2a.215
Myocardial ROS and Potassium Channels Increased oxidative stress is known to inhibit repolarizing Kv currents including Ito and several delayed rectifier IK (IKr, IKs, and IKur) in mammalian ventricular myocytes.216–218 These effects are reversible by raising cellular antioxidant glutathione levels.140,219 ROS have been shown to regulate Kv current expression by reducing the transcript/protein expression of the Kv channel subunits218 and by modulating the phosphorylation of these channel subunits through PKs such as PKA, PKC, or protein tyrosine phosphatases.220–222 Cardiac Kv channels are also regulated by NO•. It has been reported that NO• inhibits human cardiac Kv4.3 channel, thereby reducing the transient outward K+ current Ito.223 NO• also blocks Kv1.5 channel through S-nitrosylation and the activation of cGMP/ PKG pathway.224
Myocardial ROS also regulates myocyte membrane excitability through sarcK channels. During myocardial isch-
ATP
emia, fuel substrate deprivation and increased oxidative stress depolarize the mitochondrial network, leading to fluctuated

∆Ψm and ATP production levels, which result in oscillation of sarcKATP currents and APDs.69,225 The ∆Ψm depolarization of
the mitochondrial network is potentiated by widespread ROS

production induced by focal increases in mitochondrial ROS

(ROS-induced ROS release).60,62,226 IMAC plays a critical role

in ∆Ψm depolarization on increased ROS; pharmacological inhibition of IMAC has been shown to prevent ∆Ψm depolarization and the oscillation of sarcKATP currents and APD,59
as well as preventing ventricular arrhythmias in mammalian

hearts227,228 during myocardial ischemia.

Another group of K channels, residing on the mitoATP
chondrial inner membrane (mito-K channels), contribute ATP
importantly to the protective effects of IPC, an endogenous

cellular protective mechanism involving brief periods of

ischemia that confers protection against infarction produced

by a subsequent prolonged ischemia.148,229 Under physiologi-

cal conditions, mito-KATP channel opening enhances mitochondrial ROS production, triggering downstream signaling

pathways involved in gene transcription and cell growth.230

During IPC, the activation of mito-KATP channels allows mitochondrial K+ influx, resulting in partially depolarized ∆Ψm,
which leads to a compensatory increase in proton pumping

and cellular respiration to maintain ∆Ψm and ETC activ-

ity.229

of which contribute to the protection against cell death by

pathway that confers cardiac protection by reducing delete-

rious postischemic ROS production.233,234 Interestingly, NO•,

a physiologically important free radical, has been shown to

potentiate mito-KATP opening235 and triggers both early and delayed IPC.236,237 In addition, mito-KATP opening during ischemia provides additional K+ influx to maintain mitochondrial

of mitochondria and ETC.230 Pharmacological inhibition of

mito-K channels abrogates the antiarrhythmic effects of ATP
IPC,238 and several mito-K channel openers are shown to ATP
provide protective effects against ischemia-induced cardiac

arrhythmias.157,239,240

Mitochondrial ROS and Cardiac Gap Junction Regulation Cardiac gap junctions are formed by the assembly of a pair of juxtaposed intercellular hemichannels with each hemichannel consisting of 6 connexin (connexin) proteins. Gap junctions mediate the intercellular communication of small metabolites and ions and play an essential role in cardiac electric conduction.241 Among the 3 principal connexin isoforms (connexin 40, connexin 43, and connexin 45) expressed in the heart, connexin 43 is the predominant isoform expressed in ventricular myocytes.242 Ventricular connexin 43 expression has been shown to be downregulated with myocardial ischemia,243,244 and heart failure,245,246 which can lead to slowed conduction, increased electric heterogeneity and abnormal anisotropic properties of the ventricles.247,248 These changes can facilitate the initiation and maintenance of ventricular arrhythmias and SCDs.249,250

Cardiac renin–angiotensin system (RAS) activity is increased on acute ischemia, contributing to the acute and chronic myocardial remodeling in response to ischemia.251,252 RAS activation is known to increase myocardial oxidative stress and downregulate ventricular gap junction protein connexin 43.253–255 Transgenic mouse models with enhanced cardiac RAS activity255,256 have high incidence of conduction abnormality, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death owing to reduced cardiac connexin 43 and abnormal gap junction function.255,256 Using a transgenic mouse model of cardiac-restricted angiotensin-converting enzyme overexpression (ACE8/8),255 we have demonstrated that increased cardiac RAS activity leads to increased activity of cSrc, a redox-sensitive tyrosine kinase, by increasing cSrc phosphorylation at Tyr416, in the ventricular myocardium. The activation of cSrc leads to connexin 43 downregulation, impaired gap junction function, slowed cardiac conduction, and increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD.35,257 The downregulation of connexin 43 and increased risk for arrhythmias in angiotensin-converting enzyme 8/8 mice are alleviated by pharmacological inhibition of RAS258 and cSrc.257 It has been shown that increased myocardial p-cSrc leads to connexin 43 reduction through the competition between p-cSrc and connexin 43 for the binding with zonula occludens-1, a scaffolding protein at the intercalated disk, resulting in connexin 43 destabilization and degradation.259 Elevated p-cSrc levels also impair gap junction function by phosphorylating connexin 43 at tyrosine residues.260 Using the same ACE 8/8 mouse model, we have also shown that cardiac mitochondrial ROS were markedly increased with enhanced RAS activity.35,257 Treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO, but not with other types of antioxidants, decreases cSrc phosphorylation, preserves connexin 43 expression, improves gap junction function, and abolishes ventricular arrhythmias and SCD in ACE 8/8 mice.35 Although the clinical evidence suggests that exogenous antioxidants do not prevent SCD,261 these data support a role for ROS, and suppression of endogenous, mitochondria-specific ROS may be an effective therapeutic approach.
Mechanistically, we have recently demonstrated that enhanced RAS signaling increases S-nitrosylation of cardiac caveolin-1 (Cav1), an intrinsic inhibitor of cSrc, resulting in Cav1-cSrc dissociation and subsequent cSrc activation. Cav1 S-nitrosylation upon enhanced RAS signaling is mediated by increased Cav1-eNOS binding that is dependent on elevated mitochondrial ROS.262 Consistent with these findings, Cav1 knockout mice exhibit increased cSrc activation, reduced connexin 43 expression, myocardial conduction defect, and increased inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias.262 Taken together, these data suggest the critical roles of mitochondrial oxidative stress and Cav1 in AngII–induced gap junction remodeling and arrhythmia. As mitochondrial ROS are increased in myocardial ischemia251,252 and heart failure,56,57 both of which are associated with RAS activation, reduced ventricular connexin 43 and increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias and SCD, it would be of great interest to test whether the treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant

Effects of Chronic Versus Acute Metabolic Derangement and Oxidative Stress on Arrhythmogenicity In this review, we have primarily focused on the impact of acute myocardial metabolic and oxidative stress on cardiac electrophysiology, arrhythmogenicity, and SCDs. It is important to note that chronic conditions associated with metabolic derangements and excessive oxidative stress such as aging,263 hypoxia/obstructive sleep apnea,264chronic kidney disease,265 and diabetes mellitus,138,139 also result in arrhythmogenic changes that predispose to SCDs. Many of the arrhythmogenic changes related to these chronic conditions involve electric remodeling74,75 and the creation of arrhythmogenic substrates such as fibrosis,266,267 which may not be seen with acute metabolic and oxidative stress. Nevertheless, the effects of acute and chronic metabolic/oxidative stress on cardiac electric function may not be mutually exclusive. The acute application of mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, for example, can restore the reduced peak I observed with chronic heart fail-
Na
ure.57 In addition, reduced Kv currents in diabetic heart can be reversed by acute insulin treatment.140 These observations suggest the contribution of the acute, modifiable metabolic/ oxidative stress in these chronic conditions, which can be rapidly reversed by targeting the underlying metabolic/oxidative derangement. It is difficult to distinguish whether acute metabolic/oxidative changes exacerbate and amplify chronic changes or whether acute changes are unrelated to the chronic changes and simply occur on an arrhythmogenic background. Additional studies are required to address these possibilities.
Conclusions
In summary, metabolic derangement and increased oxidative stress are prevalent in arrhythmogenic cardiac conditions, particularly during myocardial ischemia. Impaired cardiac

metabolism and increased ROS production can lead to malfunction of various cellular mechanisms that are required to maintain normal electric functioning and intracellular ionic homeostasis in cardiac myocytess. The impact of altered cardiac metabolism and increased oxidative stress on cardiac arrhythmogenicity is summarized in Table 1, Figure 4 and Table 2, Figure 5, respectively. Because the conventional antiarrhythmic drugs targeting ion channels are often proarrhythmic, understanding the mechanisms linking abnormal metabolism and oxidative stress to cardiac arrhythmias may help to develop novel therapeutics to reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias and SCD in patients with cardiac diseases. These observations suggest that therapeutics tailored to ameliorate metabolic derangement and oxidative stress may prove a more efficacious alternative to traditional ion channel blocking drugs to address arrhythmia in associated with cardiac diseases, and a list of potential novel therapeutics are summarized in Table 3.
