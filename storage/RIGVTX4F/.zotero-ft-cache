Abstract
Aim. – Metformin is the most widely used oral hypoglycaemic drug, but it may lower B12 status, which could have important clinical implications. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between metformin use and vitamin B12 deﬁciency in persons with type 2 diabetes.
Methods. – Electronic database searches were undertaken (1st January 1957–1st July 2013) using the Cochrane library, Scopus, CINAHL, Grey literature databases, Pub Med Central, NICE Clinical Guidelines UK, and ongoing clinical trials. Included studies were of any study design, with data from patients with type 2 diabetes of any age or gender, taking any dose or duration of metformin. Planned primary outcomes were serum vitamin B12 levels, % prevalence or incidence of vitamin B12 deﬁciency and risk of vitamin B12 deﬁciency.
Results. – Twenty-six papers were included in the review. Ten out of 17 observational studies showed statistically signiﬁcantly lower levels of vitamin B12 in patients on metformin than not on metformin. Meta-analysis performed on four trials demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant overall mean B12 reducing effect of metformin of 57 pmol/L [WMD (ﬁxed) = –0.57 (95% CI: –35 to –79 pmol/L)] after 6 weeks to 3 months of use.
Conclusion. – The evidence from this review demonstrates an association between metformin usage and lower levels of vitamin B12 by 57 pmol/L, which leads to frank deﬁciency or borderline status in some patients with type 2 diabetes. This suggests that it is prudent to monitor B12 levels in these patients who are at increased risk of deﬁciency. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rising. For western countries, it is currently projected that there will be a 17% increase in persons with diabetes in France and Belgium by 2035 [1], with a 22% increase in both the USA and United Kingdom, a 31% increase in Canada, and a 3% to 37% increase in other European Union countries [1].
The most widely used class of drugs in persons with type 2 diabetes are the biguanides (e.g. metformin), which increase

insulin sensitivity, and contribute to weight loss [2]. However, one of the side effects of metformin is to reduce vitamin B12 status. Vitamin B12 deﬁciency is under diagnosed and undertreated [3,4]. Severe deﬁciency (e.g. pernicious anaemia) can result in macrocytic anaemia, peripheral neuropathy and mentalpsychiatric changes. Also, milder symptoms, such as weakness, tiredness, and memory loss can occur before frank anaemia [5–7].
Metformin-related vitamin B12 deﬁciency has been known for over 40 years. However, a systematic analysis of the data concerning B12 status and metformin usage has not been carried out to date speciﬁcally in patients with type 2 diabetes. Two recent meta-analyses [8,9] have shown a reduction in B12 levels in populations with metformin use but both used a mixed population of patient types (e.g. diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome,

hyperlipidaemia). Therefore, their results may differ from that of patients speciﬁcally with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and a systematic review and meta-analysis is now required in this speciﬁc patient group.
Our objective was to perform the ﬁrst systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature (observational and intervention studies) on the association between metformin use and vitamin B12 deﬁciency (as measured by serum vitamin B12) in patients with diabetes mellitus and to consider the potential implications for practice.
2. Method
2.1. Literature search
As recommended by the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (http://www.cochranelibrary.com/); electronic, hand, web and reference list searches were made of the literature to date. Core health bibliographic databases were searched from 1st January 1957 (year of the ﬁrst metformin clinical trial) to 1st July 2013. These databases included the Cochrane library, national, regional and subject speciﬁc databases, Scopus, CINAHL, Index to theses, Grey literature databases, Conference abstract databases, Pub Med Central, Zetoc, NICE Clinical Guidelines UK, ongoing trials and other electronic databases (e.g. Nexis). No ethical approval was required for this review as only analysis of already published data was used.
The full search strategy for each database is available in the online supplementary material (eSearches). A combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and free-text terms were used. The exact search phrases were: “(diabetics OR diabetes OR type 1 OR type 2 OR insulin dependent diabetics OR non-insulin dependent diabetics OR insulin dependent Diabetes OR noninsulin dependent Diabetes OR non-insulin dependent diabetics OR non-insulin dependent diabetes OR IDDM OR NIDDM) AND (metformin OR metformin hydrochloride OR biguanides OR biguanide) AND (B12 OR B12 deﬁciency OR Vitamin B12 OR Vitamin B12 deﬁciency OR cobalamin OR cyanocobalamin OR cobalamin deﬁciency OR cyanocobalamin deﬁciency OR hydroxycobalamin OR hydroxocobalamin OR hydroxycobalamin deﬁciency OR hydroxocobalamin deﬁciency)”. Reference lists from the search results were checked for relevant papers and experts in the ﬁeld and study authors were contacted to enquire about additional published or unpublished studies, ongoing trials and background data.
2.2. Eligibility criteria for inclusion and data extraction

assessed oral metformin in patients with diabetes vs. placebo (or no intervention, i.e. comparison with background data for the population). Due to the anticipated small number of intervention studies in this subject area, we did not plan to carry out any subgroup analyses. Data presented in conference abstract form was not included in the analysis.
2.3. Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcomes were serum vitamin B12 levels, % prevalence or incidence of vitamin B12 deﬁciency and odds or risk of vitamin B12 deﬁciency. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deﬁciency was based upon a serum vitamin B12 level below 150 pmol/L, with borderline deﬁciency between 150 and 220 pmol/L. In this paper, all B12 measurements reported are that of serum vitamin B12 (pmol/L), unless otherwise stated. Secondary outcomes eligible for inclusion included reported symptoms, active B12 (holotranscobalamin II; HoloTC), homocysteine (Hcy), methylmalonic acid (MMA), haemoglobin (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV), estimates of economic costs, and quality of life data. Due to lack of data on these secondary outcomes, only the primary outcomes were included in the text of the systematic review and in the meta-analysis.
2.4. Statistical analysis
For cross-sectional surveys, mean ± standard deviation (SD) and correlation coefﬁcients (r) were obtained where available. Relative risk (RR), odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) were extracted for case-control studies, and mean and standard deviations extracted for intervention studies. The number of participants (n) as well as P values and 95% conﬁdence intervals for effect estimates were extracted for all study types. Multivariate adjusted analyses were used where possible to reduce the effects of confounding.
Review manager (RevMan5.2, Cochrane Collaboration) [10] was used to perform the meta-analysis and for observational studies multivariate adjusted data used where possible to reduce the effects of confounding. All estimates are presented as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated. The Jadad scale and CONSORT statement were used to assess the quality of the design and conduct of the randomised controlled trials (RCT’s) [11–13]. The international GRADE working group grading system was used to link the quality of the evidence into recommendations [14,15].

All human studies of cross-sectional, cohort or intervention (metformin vs. placebo or other control) design published in the English language from the 1st January 1957 to 1st July 2013 were assessed. Studies reporting data from all patients of any age or gender with diabetes mellitus and taking metformin were considered for inclusion. No papers were found assessing patients with type 1 diabetes, so the review subsequently focussed only on patients with type 2 diabetes. Intervention studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis if they

speciﬁc papers (Appendix B: Table B.1–B.2; see supplementary material associated with this article online).
3.1. Systematic review
Of the 25 papers included in the systematic review, the majority showed signiﬁcantly lower vitamin B12 levels in those patients on metformin. There was only a small amount of data on clinical outcomes (e.g. neurological impairment [16], megaloblastic anaemia, homocysteine) and functional markers of B12 status. Indeed, most clinical outcomes were featured in case reports only (not included in this analysis due to poor generalizability of data for n = 1 case studies).
For observational studies, the lack of study data, between study differences and concerns over small sample sizes prevented pooling of data to assess overall effect size. One study had both cross-sectional and cohort data [17], so is mentioned twice.
The 17 cross-sectional studies (Table 1) indicated either an association of metformin use with a lower B12 concentration (10 studies [17–26]) or showed no association (7 studies [27–33]). In terms of cohort-based or retrospective case-control studies, 4 studies were included in the review (Table 2) showing a reduction in HoloTC and total vitamin B12 [17] or increased odds of B12 deﬁciency after 3 years [adjusted OR = 2.39 (95% CI 1.46 to 3.91)] [34] in metformin users, compared with non-users. A nested case-control study [35] identiﬁed a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in vitamin B12 deﬁciency in patients with type 2

diabetes with peripheral neuropathy after 6 months of metformin usage. However, one retrospective case-control study of patient notes [36] found no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the incidences of vitamin B12 deﬁciency in patients with diabetes who were using metformin compared with those not using metformin [36].
Characteristics of the intervention studies, including Jadad scores are shown in Table 3. Five intervention studies were identiﬁed [37–41] of which only two were double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled [37,40]. The Hyperinsulinemia: the Outcome of its Metabolic Effects (HOME) trial was a prospective multicentred RCT [37,40]. This trial had a threephase process including a pre-randomisation measurement in the ﬁrst 12 weeks, a post-randomisation measurement up to 16 weeks and a long-term post-randomisation phase measurement up to 4 years. At the 16-week phase, there was a statistically signiﬁcant fall in vitamin B12 levels of –14% (95% CI –4.2% vs. –24%) in the metformin group relative to placebo (P < 0.0001) [37], which dropped further to –19% (95% CI –24% to –14%) (P < 0.001) by the end of the trial at 4 years [40]. There was a 7.2% (95% CI 2.3 to 12.1) higher absolute risk of B12 deﬁciency (< 150 pmol/L) in the metformin group compared to placebo (P = 0.004) and the corresponding number needed to harm (NNH) was 13.8 per 4.3 years (95% CI 43.5 to 8.3) [40]. Importantly, this study reported a treatment by time interaction, with vitamin B12 concentrations being more extensively lowered with a longer duration of metformin use [40].

3.2. Meta-analysis
Four studies [37–39,41] were suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Three trials were of short duration [38,39,41] (≤ 4 months) and as the HOME trial data were present in two papers (interim analysis at 4 months [37] and ﬁnal analysis at 4 years [40]), the HOME trial 4 months measurement [37] was chosen for the meta-analysis rather than the 4-year measurement [40]. This was chosen in order for the HOME trial to be homogenous with the other trials in the meta-analysis. Due to the potential for signiﬁcant study heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was conducted using both ﬁxed and random effects models. The I2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity between study outcomes.
Fig. 2 summarises the meta-analysis with 95% conﬁdence intervals indicating statistical signiﬁcance at both individual study levels for Bauman et al. [39] and Wulffele et al. [37] and for the overall effect estimate [WMD(ﬁxed) = –57.1 (95% CI –35.5 to –78.8) P < 0.001 I2 = 72%]. The wide conﬁdence intervals in some studies provide a cautionary note on interpretation. The mean difference in serum B12 levels suggests that taking metformin for 6 weeks to 3 months leads to a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in B12 concentration by 57 pmol/L. There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity, with I2 = 72%.
A sensitivity analysis, with removal of each study in turn, showed a WMD(ﬁxed) estimate of –44.6 (95% CI –67.7 to –21.46, P = 0.0002, I2 = 0%) (Bauman et al. [39]), –56.7 (95% CI –78.6 to –35.0, P < 0.00001, I2 = 81%) (Leung et al. [41]), –71.1 (95% CI –97.1 to –45.1, P < 0.00001, I2 = 72%) (Sahin et al. [38]) and –60.1 (95% CI –93.5 to –28.4, P = 0.0002, I2 = 81%) (Wulffele et al. [37]). Therefore, the removal of the largest study [37] only had a small inﬂuence on the effect size estimate, albeit with wider 95% conﬁdence intervals and slightly increased heterogeneity. Conducting the meta-analysis of the four studies with a random effects model also led to a statistically signiﬁcant effect, but with a slightly larger effect size and wider 95% conﬁdence intervals [WMD(random) = –70.1 (95% CI –120.5, –19.7), P = 0.006, I2 = 72%].
4. Discussion
Observational data in this review has shown lower B12 levels, and an increased risk of borderline or frank B12 deﬁciency with metformin use. Most intervention trials in this review were only of short duration (up to 4 months) but indicated a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in B12 levels beyond the 6-week period

and in some cases, led to frank deﬁciency. Our ﬁxed-effects meta-analysis of four intervention trials showed a statistically signiﬁcant lowering of vitamin B12 levels by 57 pmol/L (95% CI: –35 to –79).
This reduction in B12 levels could be clinically signiﬁcant in causing frank deﬁciency (< 150 pmol/L) or a borderline status (150–220 pmol/L) in some patients who are in the range of 207–277 pmol/L before metformin treatment. Indeed, 20% of men and 27% of women (19–64 years old) in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2004) [42] had a serum B12 concentration of < 200 pmol/L [42]. Accordingly, the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer) cohort in Europe has shown that 5% of adults (< 60 years old) have a B12 concentration of < 175 pmol/L [43,44]. According to the effect size found in our meta-analysis, it would be predicted that a signiﬁcant proportion of the patients with type 2 diabetes in European population are in danger of developing frank B12 deﬁciency or at least borderline levels of deﬁciency during the ﬁrst four months of metformin treatment.
In terms of previous research, our results supports the recent meta-analysis by Niafar et al. which found a reduction of 66 pmol/L [–65.8 (95% CI –78.1 to –53.6 pmol/L), P < 0.00001] for metformin use in an analysis of a more heterogeneous group of patients (including studies of speciﬁc groups of patients with hyperlipidaemia and polycystic ovarian syndrome) [8]. Our result is also similar to that of Liu et al. [9], who found a reduction of 54 pmol/L in a meta-analysis, but included rosiglitazone as a control in the pooled estimate. The fact that our estimate is similar to these other meta-analyses suggests that the effect of metformin on B12 may not vary by patient population studied and thus separate guidance might not be required for different clinical populations. The concordance with the other meta-analysis also supports the reliability of our effect size. Since our electronic searches were completed, there have been 8 observational studies published that are relevant to our review [45–51]. All of these studies have supported a reduction in B12 status with metformin use, or higher than expected levels of deﬁciency in metformin using patients. Of note, Beulens et al. found both reduced vitamin B12 and holotranscobalamin in metformin users [51]. Therefore, inclusion of these articles would have been unlikely to change the overall results of our systematic review, although it is important to note that the study by de Groot-Kamphuis et al. found that metformin use was not associated with risk of neuropathy or anaemia [46]. Importantly, there have been no new intervention studies published to the authors’ knowledge since the end date of our searches, so our

meta-analysis estimate for intervention studies can be considered up to date.
4.1. Limitations
Strengths of this work include the fact that to the author’s knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise all the research evidence for the association between metformin and vitamin B12 deﬁciency in patients with type 2 diabetes speciﬁcally. However, most of the studies in this review were conducted in outpatient clinics and not in primary care, which limits generalizability. The wide variation in study design, wide conﬁdence intervals in some studies, lack of standardisation of assessment of vitamin B12 status and a small number of interventional trials make clear conclusions difﬁcult to elucidate. Usage of a random effects model due to the presence of heterogeneity made the estimate for the B12 reducing ability of metformin slightly larger, with wider conﬁdence intervals. Our meta-analysis only included trial measurements at ≤ 4 months so may not be applicable for longer time scales. Effect sizes may differ by age group of trial participants (e.g. the lowering effect could theoretically be more profound in the elderly), but this could not be assessed in this analysis due to a lack of studies in different age groups.
There were also other limitations in terms of study quality and design for the intervention studies, with Jadad score ≤ 3 in all but one study. Only one of the intervention studies (HOME study, data in two papers [37,40]) met the criteria for a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. This is likely to affect the accuracy of the meta-analysis estimate calculated. Most studies contained a small number of participants, leading to the HOME trial [37] receiving 55% of the weight in the meta-analysis. However, the sensitivity analysis showed that removal of this trial from the analysis did not greatly change the effect size. We could not conduct funnel plots to assess bias (e.g. publication bias) as we only had four studies in the review, and funnel plots are known to be less reliable for analyses based on a small number of trials, studying a small sample of individuals [52].
Finally, due to lack of data, secondary outcomes were not assessed as a part of this review but highlight a research gap warranting further study. Also, there was some suggestion in three studies that dose and duration of metformin could be signiﬁcant factors in determining B12 levels [34] [26,53]. This also could not be assessed in more detail due to lack of studies reporting data for dose and duration.
4.2. Implications for research and practice

(1000 ␮cg) appears to rectify the levels in most patients [35] being as effective as parenteral therapy [54,55]. Regular oral B12 or annual B12 injections have been recommended as safe ways to maintain levels in B12 deﬁcient patients [55]. Therefore effective treatments are available, but it is unclear what the vitamin B12 monitoring strategy should be for patients being prescribed metformin. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that further large cohort studies and high quality longer term intervention studies assessing clinical endpoints of vitamin B12 deﬁciency are now required, in order that evidence-based guidelines can be produced for screening and treatment of vitamin B12 deﬁciency in metformin treated patients with type 2 diabetes.
In addition, this review suggests the need for a cost–beneﬁt analysis, comparing a ‘watch and wait’ strategy of clinical case ﬁnding versus regular vitamin B12 status checks. This should consider the management of B12 status in screened vs. unscreened patients, and the effects of this upon usage of healthcare services e.g. falls in the elderly secondary to neurological damage [56].
5. Conclusion
This review of patients with type 2 diabetes shows a reduction in B12 status by 57 pmol/L after up to 4 months of metformin use, which based on European data for B12 status would be predicted to lead to frank deﬁciency in a signiﬁcant proportion of patients. Our ﬁndings support that of previously published meta-analyses of more heterogeneous populations of metformin users [8,9]. A cost–beneﬁt analysis is now required to fully investigate the most effective protocols for treating this widespread problem (e.g. watch and wait vs. clinical screening) and appropriate clinical guidelines produced.

Our meta-analysis provides an assessment as to the effect size of the association between metformin and B12 status speciﬁcally in patients with type 2 diabetes, based on a meta-analysis of short-term therapy (up to 4 months).
Clinically, our results suggest that there is a clear need for evidence-based guidelines and for examination of the implications for practice. The traditional treatment for B12 deﬁciency has been with parenteral therapy due to poor oral absorption. However, it is currently recognised that high dose oral B12
