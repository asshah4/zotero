Gallavardin Phenomenon in Aortic Stenosis
A Possible Mechanism
Thomas D. Giles, MD; Enrique C. Martinez, MD; George E. Burch, MD

In 1925, Gallavardin reported that the harsh murmur of aortic valvu-
lar stenosis could change in quality
and become musical at the apex.1 He
postulated that the high-pitched mu-
sical components of the murmur of
aortic stenosis were preferentially transmitted to the apex through solid tissues, whereas the lower-pitched
components were transmitted to the
neck vessels via the flow of blood.
Subsequently, Gallavardin's findings have been noted by others.2-5 Thus, the Gallavardin phenomenon and its proposed mechanism have become well accepted.
While recently studying a patient
with aortic stenosis and the Gallavar-
din phenomenon, it occurred to us that the high-pitched musical murmur might be secondary to the development of papillary muscle dysfunction. The following evidence is presented to support this hypothesis.
Patient Summary
A 30-year-old man was admitted to the Tulane Cardiology Service at the Charity Hospital of Louisiana at New Orleans for
evaluation and treatment of severe aortic
stenosis that was first diagnosed when the patient was 19 years of age. On admission, he complained of progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, ankle edema, and pro¬ ductive cough followed by hemoptysis.
Physical examination disclosed the fol¬ lowing values: blood pressure, 92/70 mm Hg; pulse rate, 108 beats per minute; respi¬ rations, 16 per minute; and body tempera-

ture, 36.8 C (98.4 F). The carotid pulse was of low amplitude and had a delayed up¬ stroke. A sustained apical thrust was felt
in the sixth intercostal space at the ante¬
rior axillary line. A rough, harsh, grade 4 ejection-type systolic murmur was heard
over the second intercostal space at the
right sternal border, over the carotid ar¬ teries, and at the left sternal border. This harsh murmur could be faintly heard at the cardiac apex. A musical, well-localized grade 2/4 "diamond-shaped" systolic mur¬ mur was heard predominantly at the car¬
diac apex. The second heart sound was
narrowly split. A faint decrescendo early

blowing diastolic murmur was heard at the left parasternal area and cardiac apex.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus tachycardia, left atrial and left ven¬ tricular hypertrophy, and ST-segment and T-wave changes typical of anterolateral papillary muscle disease (Fig 1). Teleoroentgenograms of the chest showed left ventricular and left atrial enlargement with venous congestion and Kerley lines (Fig 1). Cardiac fluoroscopy and tomo-
grams of the aortic valve showed calcifica¬ tion of the aortic valve cusps.
Phonocardiographic Studies
Phonocardiograms were recorded with the patient in the recumbent po¬ sition. Simultaneous tracings were recorded from the aortic and apical areas. The pass bands for recording
the murmurs were 50 to 105 hertz for
the aortic area and 250 to 1,250 Hz for the apex. With these pass bands,
seemingly identical murmurs were recorded from both areas (Fig 2, left).3
After control tracings were recorded, the patient inhaled amyl nitrite for approximately 20 seconds. Continuous strip recordings were made for one to two minutes. Approx¬ imately 20 seconds following inhala¬ tion of amyl nitrite, the systolic mur¬ mur at the apex gradually decreased in intensity until it disappeared at the peak of the sinus tachycardia (Fig 2, center). During this period, the sys¬
tolic murmur recorded over the aortic
area decreased relatively little, the decrease probably being a result of
the reduced vibrations recorded from
the mitral valve murmur. At approxi¬ mately 60 seconds following inhala¬ tion of the amyl nitrite, an increase in intensity of the murmur over the aortic and apical areas was recorded (Fig 2, right). These findings at the base are important in that they are
not characteristic of aortic valve ste¬ nosis.
When the pass band for record¬
ing the aortic murmur was changed to 250-1,250 Hz, similar diminu¬ tion in the intensity of the murmur was also observed following inhala¬ tion of amyl nitrite (Fig 3, left and center). A late increase in the inten¬ sity of the murmur was shown again (Fig 3, right).

at aortic valve replacement. Post¬
mortem examination disclosed a se¬
verely calcified aortic valve. There was considerable left ventricular hy¬ pertrophy, and scarring was evident throughout the left ventricle includ¬ ing the left ventricular papillary mus¬
cles. The mitral valve leaflets were normal and the left atrium showed
minimal dilatation. Microscopical ex¬ amination demonstrated hypertrophy and fatty infiltration of myocardial
fibers and diffuse fibrosis.
Comment
When the Gallavardin phenomenon was first described, the concept of papillary muscle dysfunction did not
exist. When Gallavardin examined
three patients who had classic mur¬
murs of aortic valvular stenosis at the
base and a high-pitched musical mur¬ mur at the apex, he postulated that the patients had either simple aortic lesion or organic mitral régurgitation
associated with aortic stenosis.
Whether or not the papillary muscles were examined is not known. Autop¬ sy findings in two of Gallavardin's reported patients demonstrated only
disease of the aortic valves. There¬
fore, he concluded that the murmur was of aortic origin and that it changed in quality (timbre) and be¬ came musical in apical propagation.
Gallavardin proposed that the sepa¬ rate pathways of sound transmission utilized by two different groups of vi-

brations originating at the aortic valve were responsible for the appar¬
ent presence of two distinct murmurs.
He proposed that the rough noise pro¬
duced at the valvular orifice was transmitted to the base of the heart
by the flow of blood, while the musi¬ cal sound composed of different har¬ monics was transmitted primarily by solid tissues to the cardiac apex. Thus,
the two murmurs were considered to
be different vibrations emanating
from the aortic valve that were sepa¬
rated by preferential transmission
rather than one murmur that was
modified in quality as it was being
transmitted to the apex.
Although this interpretation has been generally accepted,-5 it is pos¬ sible that midsystolic murmurs of such musical quality and shape could be due to mitral régurgitation sec¬ ondary to papillary muscle dysfunc¬
tion. The clinical manifestations of
papillary muscle dysfunction have
been described." The murmur may
frequently be diamond-shaped, highpitched, and well transmitted to the base, and may be caused by ventricu¬ lar hypertrophy and dilatation and scarring of the papillary muscles. Thus, papillary muscle dysfunction is found in patients with aortic steno¬ sis. Also, papillary muscle dysfunction
is often associated with characteris¬
tic electrocardiographic changes.7-8 Therefore, the coexistence of papil¬ lary muscle dysfunction in our pa-

tient was supported by the clinical data, the murmur, the ECG, and the pathologic changes noted in the papil¬ lary muscles at necropsy.
Finally, the change in the musical murmur following inhalation of amyl nitrite suggests that papillary muscle dysfunction was present. The value of amyl nitrite in differentiating mur¬
murs of aortic stenosis from those of
mitral régurgitation has been re¬ ported." Furthermore, the value of amyl nitrite in distinguishing mur¬ murs of mitral régurgitation second¬ ary to papillary muscle dysfunction from the murmur secondary to aortic stenosis has been emphasized.7 Gen¬ erally, amyl nitrite diminishes the in¬ tensity of the murmurs of mitral régurgitation early, whereas it in¬ creases the intensity of the murmur
of aortic stenosis later.
The effect of amyl nitrite on the murmur of mitral régurgitation sec¬ ondary to papillary muscle dysfunc¬ tion is variable.5 However, such mur¬ murs usually decrease in intensity early after inhalation of amyl nitrite, as was observed in our patient. Thus, the noticeable diminution in intensity of high-pitched murmurs recorded at
the cardiac apex and base in our pa¬
tient suggests that the murmur was
produced by mitral régurgitation. Mi¬ tral régurgitation in our patient would almost certainly be secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction. It is difficult to understand how the physi-

ologic effects of amyl nitrite could di¬ minish a murmur originating at the aortic valve. It is possible, of course,
that the increased flow across the
stenotic orifice could change the qual¬ ity of the murmur.
It is possible that the patients in¬ cluded in Gallavardin's original re¬ port had papillary muscle dysfunc¬ tion. Although not yet described at that time, the entity certainly ex¬
isted. Such a mechanism should be
considered, particularly for the apical
murmur heard in the second of Galla¬
vardin's three patients. That particu¬ lar patient was a 60-year-old woman with syphilitic heart disease, aortic régurgitation, and chronic congestive
heart failure. At autopsy, aortic le¬ sions histologically characteristic of syphilitic aortitis were found. Aortic
stenosis was considered to be pro¬
duced by the calcareous adhesions of
one of the commissures that fixed it
against the aortic wall.

Thus, we consider that the "Galla¬ vardin phenomenon" may be due to
the association of aortic stenosis with
mitral régurgitation secondary to pap¬ illary muscle dysfunction. We are not proposing that papillary muscle dys¬ function explains all occurrences of the phenomenon, but rather that it
may be one mechanism for the pro¬
duction of this interesting clinical finding. It is difficult for us to accept the explanation of Gallavardin based
on the differences in blood and solid tissue transmission. Gallavardin's ex¬
planation needs study to learn whether or not it is plausible.
Summary
A 32-year-old man had classic, se¬ vere, calcine, aortic valvular stenosis, with a rough systolic murmur at the base and a high-pitched, midsystolic, "diamond-shaped" musical murmur at the apex—findings that meet the criteria for the Gallavardin phenom-

enon. However, concomitant mitral régurgitation secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction was considered in this patient. Clinical data supported this diagnosis. When the patient in¬ haled amyl nitrite, simultaneous phonocardiographic recordings from
the aortic and mitral areas showed evidence of concomitant aortic valvu¬
lar stenosis and mitral régurgitation. Necropsy findings supported the diagnosis of papillary muscle dys¬
function as the cause of the mitral re-
gurgitation. Therefore, the Gallavardin phenomenon in our patient was apparently due to severe aortic ste¬ nosis associated with mitral régurgi¬ tation secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction.
