ABSTRACT

*Comprehensive Cancer Center

Background
Systemic activation of hemostasis is frequently observed in cancer patients, even in the absence of thrombosis. Moreover, this activation has been implicated in tumor progression, angiogenesis
n and metastatic spread. Increased levels of D-dimer, which is a degradation product of cross-linked
fibrin, indicate a global activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis.
tio Design and Methods
In a prospective and observational cohort study, we assessed the prognostic value of D-dimer levels for overall survival and mortality risk in 1178 cancer patients included in the Vienna Cancer
a and Thrombosis Study (CATS). Patients were followed over 2 years at regular intervals until d occurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death. D-dimer levels were measured
with a quantitative D-dimer latex agglutination assay
n Results u The main solid tumors were malignancies of the lung (n=182), breast (n=157), lower gastrointesti-
nal tract (n=133), pancreas (n=74), stomach (n=50), kidney (n=37), prostate (n=133), and brain
o (n=148); 201 of the patients had hematologic malignancies; 63 had other tumors. During a median
follow-up of 731 days, 460 (39.0%) patients died. The overall survival probabilities for patients
F with D-dimer levels categorized into four groups based on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quartiles of the Dti dimer distribution in the total study population were 88%, 82%, 66% and 53% after 1 year, and
78%, 66%, 50% and 30% after 2 years, respectively (P<0.001). The univariate hazard ratio of D-
r dimer (per double increase) for mortality was 1.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-1.6, P<0.001) and
remained increased in multivariable analysis including tumor subgroups, age, sex and venous
to thromboembolism.

pivotal enzyme in the process of blood coagulation and leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the end product of blood coagulation and finally results in the
n formation of a fibrin clot. Tumor cells also possess strong
procoagulant activities that induce local activation of the
tio coagulation system and deposition of fibrin, which has an
important role in the formation of tumor stroma and hematogenous spread of tumor cells.4,5 The interaction of
a fibrin, platelets and tumor cells leads to the formation of
platelet-fibrin-tumor-cell aggregates that promote
d endothelial adhesion and metastatic spread, as well as
tumor cell growth and tumor cell survival.6 In addition,
n fibrin degradation products have been shown to display
strong angiogenic properties.7
u D-dimer is a biomarker that globally indicates the actio vation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis. It is a degradation
product of fibrin, which is produced when cross-linked
F fibrin is degraded by plasmin-induced fibrinolytic activity.
As D-dimer plasma levels are elevated after clot forma-
ti tion, the measurement of D-dimer is routinely used in
conjunction with clinical parameters in the initial assess-
r ment of suspected acute VTE.8 Elevated D-dimer levels
may also be observed in other clinical settings, such as
to cancer, pregnancy and infectious diseases or following
trauma and surgery.9 Recently, high D-dimer levels were reported to be predictive of the occurrence of VTE in can-
S cer patients.10-12 In patients with unprovoked VTE, D-
dimer levels have been demonstrated to predict recurrence
ta of VTE after discontinuation of oral anticoagulant thera-
py.8 In a prospective, interventional study in patients without cancer who had unprovoked VTE and who had
a received vitamin K antagonists, D-dimer levels were r measured 1 month after discontinuation of anticoagular tion to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy,
suggesting a prolonged anticoagulation for prevention of
e recurrent VTE in patients with elevated D-dimer levels.13 Cancer is frequently associated with activation of the
F hemostatic system and the extent of this activation has
been reported to correlate with a more advanced tumor

Exclusion criteria for all participants were: (i) overt bacterial or viral infection; (ii) venous or arterial thromboembolism within the preceding 3 months; and (iii) continuous anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists or low-molecular-weight heparins. For patients with progression of disease, additional exclusion criteria were surgery or radiotherapy within the preceding 2 weeks and chemotherapy within 3 months prior to study inclusion. At the time of study enrollment a blood sample was drawn for D-dimer measurement.
The observation period started at the time of blood sampling and a regular follow-up was performed approximately every 3 months. Patients were followed prospectively either for a maximum of 2 years, or until the occurrence of VTE or death, loss of follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. In the case of sudden death, autopsy was requested. Available autopsy protocols were checked for VTE. Once a year the Austrian Mortality Registry was searched for entries concerning study participants. All deaths were included in the analysis of the current study.
All clinical parameters, complete follow-up information and plasma samples for D-dimer measurement were available for 1178 patients who had been enrolled between October 2003 and March 2010 for analyses of D-dimer levels as a prognostic parameter for overall survival and risk of mortality.
Outcome measure
The outcome measure of the current analysis was death from any cause within 2 years after entry into the study.
Blood sampling and laboratory analysis of D-dimer levels
Venous blood samples were collected into Vacutainer citrate tubes (Vacuette; Greiner-Bio-One; containing 1/10 volume sodium citrate stock solution at 0.129 mmol/L) by sterile, atraumatic venipuncture. Samples were centrifuged to obtain platelet-poor plasma, and aliquots were stored at −80°C until testing was performed in series. D-dimer levels were measured by a quantitative

ti F Results r Baseline characteristics of the study population
In total, 1178 prospectively followed patients with can-
to cer were included. Their detailed characteristics are listed

VTE occurred in 7.7% of the study population (n=91, 36 females and 55 males; median [interquartile range] age, 62 [67-80] years) during follow-up. The site of VTE was an isolated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity in 40 patients, an isolated pulmonary embolism in 36 patients and a combined DVT of the lower extremity with pulmonary embolism in 4 patients. In 11 patients other sites of VTE were recorded. Pulmonary embolism was documented to be fatal in four patients.
Distribution of D-dimer levels in the study population and in subgroups
In the total study population, the median D-dimer level (µg/mL) at study inclusion was 0.71 (25th-75th percentile: 0.34-1.33). The median D-dimer level in patients with brain tumors was 0.66 (25th-75th percentile: 0.34-1.33) and in those with hematologic malignancies it was 0.59 (25th75th percentile: 0.34-1.09). The median D-dimer level was higher in patients with solid tumors with distant metastasis than in those without distant metastasis, being 0.99 (25th-75th percentile: 0.55-2.01) and 0.50 (25th-75th percentile: 0.34-0.91), respectively.

D-dimer level and mortality risk according to site of tumor
The association of D-dimer levels with risk of mortality was analyzed separately for each cancer site. In univariate analyses, an elevated D-dimer level qualified as a prognostic parameter associated with increased mortality risk in patients with brain tumors, lymphomas and in those with breast, lung, stomach, colorectal, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Table 4 summarizes the distribution of D-dimer levels and their association with mortality risk in patients with the various types of cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses for each cancer site are provided in the online supplementary appendix (Online Supplementary Figures S1-S11).
Discussion
In this large prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with a broad range of malignancies, we found that high plasma levels of D-dimer are associated with increased risk of mortality. After 2 years, the probability of overall survival in cancer patients with the highest Ddimer levels of the total study population (D-dimer levels ranging from 3rd quartile to the maximum level) was just 30% as opposed to that of 78% in cancer patients with lower levels (D-dimer levels ranging from the minimum to the 1st quartile). The mortality risk in patients with elevated D-dimer remained independently increased in different subgroups after adjustment for age, sex, and VTE.
These are novel findings that concur with previous observations in small studies including patients with tumors in single sites such as breast,14-16 colon and rectum,17,18 lung19-21 and brain.26 Whereas these small studies did not analyze whether the association of high D-dimer levels with poor prognosis was independent of VTE, we

da also recorded the occurrence of VTE during a relatively n long follow-up time of up to 2 years, as this was the pri-
mary aim of our study.
u VTE is a frequent complication of cancer and is among o the leading causes of death in cancer patients. In epidemi-
ological studies, VTE was associated with a poor progno-
F sis and with a more than 3-fold increased risk of mortality
in the general cancer population.27-29 Consistently, in our
ti present study the occurrence of VTE was a prognostic
parameter for shorter survival and resulted in a 3.2-fold
r increased risk of mortality. The association of D-dimer
and VTE with poor prognosis of cancer was independent
to of each other in hematologic malignancies and solid
tumors with and without metastases. This observation is of particular interest, because high D-dimer levels have
S previously been reported to predict VTE in cancer
patients.10-12 Here, we could show that enhanced activation
ta of coagulation and fibrinolysis, as reflected by high levels
of D-dimer, is independently associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with solid cancers and hemato-
a logic malignancies and is not necessarily mediated by the r increased risk of VTE in patients with elevated D-dimer r levels. In this respect, it is of interest that anticoagulation,
in particular that provided by low molecular weight
e heparins, has been suggested to have a favorable effect on
survival of cancer patients.30 It would, therefore, be useful
F to investigate the use of low molecular weight heparins in
cancer patients with elevated D-dimer levels for preven-
© tion of VTE and improvement of survival.

vival even after curative resection.17 Similarly, D-dimer levels correlated with clinical stage, lymphovascular invasion and axillary lymph node involvement in operable breast cancer and D-dimer was suggested to be a biomarker for predicting early tumor metastases.14 In metastatic breast cancer, D-dimer levels were significantly associated with tumor load determined by imaging techniques.16 Interestingly, plasma D-dimer levels have been shown to correlate with tumor markers such as CA-125 in ovarian cancer32,33 and carcinoembryonic antigen in colorectal cancer.18 The latter study demonstrated that high D-dimer levels predicted disease progression and overall survival better than carcinoembryonic antigen did, indicating that assays of D-dimer may serve as a useful strategy for disease monitoring in patients undergoing therapy. In our study, baseline D-dimer levels were higher in cancer patients with metastases. We adjusted the association of elevated D-dimer level with overall survival and mortality for the presence or absence of metastases and found that the poor prognosis of patients with high D-dimer levels was independent of the presence of metastases suggesting that D-dimer might be a clinically important marker for the prognosis of cancer in general.
Together with the previous observations, our study points towards a relation between activation of hemostasis, reflected by plasma levels of D-dimer, and a more aggressive tumor biology leading to poor clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, this association is explained in experimental studies that have demonstrated the signifi-

As expected, age was also associated with an increased cance of abnormalities in hemostasis and fibrinolysis for

n There are some limitations concerning the present
study. D-dimer levels were measured only once at study
tio inclusion. Future longitudinal studies with serial measure-
ments of D-dimer levels would be necessary to analyze their correlation with disease progression or remission and
a to investigate the influence of anti-cancer treatment.
Furthermore, the prognosis of cancer patients is largely
d dependent on tumor stage. In our study, we did not have
information on the exact tumor stage in patients with
n solid tumors, although we did record the presence or
absence of distant metastases in all patients with solid
u tumors at their inclusion into the study. In multivariable o analysis, the association of elevated D-dimer levels with
increased risk of mortality was independent of the pres-
F ence of distant metastasis. Another limitation of the study
is that we recorded only symptomatic VTE events during
ti the observation period. The prevalence of asymptomatic
VTE in cancer patients has been reported to be signifi-
r cant.37-39 We cannot exclude that asymptomatic VTE was
present in some patients and impaired their disease course
to and survival. Since autopsy is not performed on a routine
basis in cancer patients and autopsy protocols were not, therefore, always available, fatal pulmonary embolism
S may have been missed in some cases. However, the inci-
dence of VTE events in our study corresponds very well

ically to deaths from cancer as the outcome measure. In a previous study including 705 patients with solid
tumors, we found significant associations of C-reactive protein and soluble P-selectin with increased risk of mortality.42 We propose extending our prospective cohort study, which is still ongoing, and recruiting more patients in order to allow analyses of other biomarkers and direct comparison between the predictive values of the different biomarkers on survival in cancer patients.
In conclusion, the estimation of a cancer patient’s prognosis is of utmost clinical interest and may help when making decisions on the type and intensity of anti-cancer treatment. Our results suggest that D-dimer is a promising prognostic biomarker associated with poor overall survival in the general cancer population. Further prospective studies are needed to establish the role of D-dimer levels with regard to clinical outcomes in cancer patients, such as disease-free, cancer-specific and overall survival.
