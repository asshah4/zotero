Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inﬂexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death.
Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs.
Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p Ͻ .001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD.
Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inﬂexibility previously shown to have prognostic signiﬁcance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD.

M ilitary combat is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in veterans after return from service, although the mechanisms are not clear (1). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction resulting from exposure to severe psychological stress, is common in combat veterans. The lifetime prevalence in Vietnam veterans is 15% to 19% (2–6) and possibly higher among military personnel of the Iraq and Afghanistan conﬂicts (7,8). In the US general population, it is approximately 8% (9–12).
Recent studies have suggested a link between PTSD and the risk of ischemic heart disease incidence and mortality (13). A commonly endorsed explanation for this association is possible “wear and tear” of the cardiovascular system due to repeated sympathetic nervous system stimulation and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) withdrawal caused by trauma-reminiscent stimuli in everyday life (14,15). Over time, these repeated insults

might lead to increased risk for a variety of chronic somatic conditions, including cardiovascular disease (16,17).
Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of beat-to-beat heart rate ﬂuctuations over time (18), is a useful indicator of autonomic function and a strong independent predictor of mortality (19). Thus far, PTSD and some other anxiety disorders have been associated with lower respiratory sinus arrhythmia and baroreﬂex sensitivity, suggesting impaired autonomic modulation (20–24). However, PTSD has also been related to increased 24-hour lowfrequency HRV (25). With these previous conﬂicting data, larger studies with careful consideration of potential confounders are needed (26). Genetic predisposition, which is substantial for both PTSD and HRV (27,28) as well as the early environmental and developmental factors, could also confound this association (29).
Building upon these prior studies, we sought to examine the associations among combat trauma, PTSD, and long-term measures of HRV assessed by means of 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings in a large, well-characterized study of middle-aged veteran twins. We were able to adjust for a comprehensive set of potential confounding factors, such as other psychiatric diagnoses and behavioral/cardiovascular risk factors. Taking advantage of the twin design, we were also able to account for genetic and early environmental inﬂuences. We hypothesized that combat exposure and PTSD are both associated with lower HRV, and that the association of combat exposure with HRV occurs primarily through PTSD. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these associations are independent of possible genetic and early environmental confounders as well as cardiovascular risk factors and depression.

previously (30,31). Their purpose was to elucidate the role of depression and PTSD on subclinical cardiovascular disease. Because of the similarity in protocols, these two samples were combined. Both projects recruited middle-aged male monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the VET (Vietnam Era Twin) Registry (32) who were born between 1946 and 1956 and were discordant for major depression or PTSD or unaffected (control subjects). Pairs of twins were examined at the same time at the Emory University General Clinical Research Center, and all data collection, including ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, occurred during a 24-hour admission under controlled conditions. The two twins maintained an identical schedule while in the study at Emory. Activity was limited to leisurely ambulation within the Emory facilities, and all assessment, including the ambulatory ECG monitoring, began and ended at the same time. Zygosity information by means of DNA typing was available for all twin pairs. Both studies were approved by the Emory Institutional Review Board, and all twins signed an informed consent.
Measurement of HRV Twins wore an ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitor (GE Mar-
quette SEER digital system; GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, Wisconsin) for 24 hours and had matched recording times, schedules, and activity levels. Activity was restricted to quiet walking around the campus, and participants were instructed to refrain from smoking and drinking alcohol or coffee during the recording. The HRV data were analyzed following published methodology as previously described (30,33). The heart rate spectrum was computed with a fast Fourier transform with a Parzen window. Because long-term autonomic function was the goal of this study, the fast Fourier transform was performed on the 24-hour R-R interval ﬁle. The power spectrum was integrated over four discrete frequency bands: ultra-low frequency (ULF) Ͻ.0033 Hz; very low frequency (VLF) .0033 to Ͻ.04 Hz; low frequency (LF) .04 to Ͻ.15 Hz; and high frequency (HF) .15 to Ͻ.40 Hz (34). These frequency bands integrate heart rate ﬂuctuations in response to many physiological stimuli. These include, among others, circadian patterns and physical activity (ULF), inﬂuences of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (VLF), baroreceptor activity (LF), and respiration (HF) (18,35,36). Other than HF HRV, which is almost exclusively inﬂuenced by the PNS, both sympathetic nervous system and PNS together affect the other frequency bands. Total power, incorporating the full spectrum Ͻ.40 Hz, was also measured. Twins whose recordings showed Ͼ20% interpolation or Ͻ18 recorded hours were excluded from the analysis.
Assessment of PTSD, Depression, and Combat Trauma We administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
IV (37) to classify twins on the basis of a lifetime history and current PTSD. Remitted PTSD was deﬁned as having a lifetime but not current diagnosis of PTSD. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV also provided a diagnosis of other psychiatric disorders, including major depression, a lifetime history of alcohol and of drug abuse or dependence, as well as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. The ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was also administered to the SAVEIT subgroup to assess PTSD symptom severity; therefore, it was available in approximately 36% of the sample (38). Combat exposure was assessed with the Combat Exposure Scale (CES), a validated seven-question survey instrument (score range 0–28) (39).

Other Measurements A medical history and a physical exam were obtained by a
research nurse or physician assistant. Abdominal and hip circumferences were measured to derive the waist/hip ratio (WHR). Hypertension was deﬁned by a measured systolic blood pressure Ͼ140 mm Hg or current treatment with antihypertensive medications. Diabetes mellitus was deﬁned as having a fasting glucose level Ͼ126 mg/dL or current treatment with antidiabetic medications. Venous blood samples were drawn for the measurement of glucose and lipid proﬁle after an overnight fast. Glucose was measured on the Beckman CX7 chemistry autoanalyzer. Direct high-density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured with homogeneous assays (Equal Diagnostics, Exton, Pennsylvania). Physical activity was assessed with a modiﬁed version of the Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity that documented physical activity at work and during sports and nonsports activities (40). The global physical activity score was used in the analysis. Cigarette smoking was classiﬁed into current, never, or past smoker. Wine, beer, liquor, coffee, tea, and soda consumption were measured in drinks/day. A history of coronary heart disease was deﬁned as a previous diagnosis of myocardial infarction or previous coronary revascularization procedures. Detailed information on current use of medications was also collected.
Statistical Analysis Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account
for clustering within twin pairs in all analyses. Baseline characteristic differences were compared among twins with no PTSD, current PTSD, and remitted PTSD, with both linear (for continuous variables) and log (for binary variables) analysis of variance testing. The maximum pair-wise Z scores comparing no PTSD, current PTSD, and remitted PTSD were reported for each characteristic. The association between combat exposure and PTSD status (current, remitted, or neither) with HRV was ﬁrst examined by analyzing twins as separate individuals. Each frequency spectra of HRV was log-transformed so that it could be analyzed as a normally distributed outcome variable. Combat exposure and the CAPS PTSD symptom severity scores were analyzed primarily as continuous variables; to assess a doseresponse relationship, additional analyses were performed with CAPS and CES as three-level ordinal variables, where the ﬁrst category was zero (which included approximately half of the sample or ﬁrst 2 quartiles), and the remaining two categories corresponded approximately to the third and fourth quartile. Current PTSD was analyzed as a mediator of the association between combat exposure and HRV by evaluating the change in b coefﬁcient that occurred after adding it to the multivariable model. The Sobel’s Z test was performed to test the statistical signiﬁcance of PTSD as a mediator between combat exposure and HRV (41).
Multivariate Modeling The GEE models were used with log-transformed HRV as the
dependent variable. Potential confounding factors to be included in multivariate analysis were carefully chosen a priori as those factors that might potentially be related to both HRV and PTSD. These included age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, current and past smoking, and physical activity. Additional covariates were evaluated for possible confounding, including lifetime history of major depression, use of antidepressants, aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, anxiolytic drugs, body mass index,

WHR, drug abuse history, alcohol abuse history, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and history of coronary heart disease. Of these variables, a history of major depression, use of antidepressants, body mass index, and a history of drug abuse were found to cause Ͼ5% change on the effect size of PTSD on HRV and were added to the model. The same covariates were used in the models of combat exposure (CES) and PTSD symptom severity (CAPS). Models that examined remitted PTSD additionally adjusted for current PTSD. Analyses were repeated in a subgroup of twins free from coronary heart disease. Other anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, were added to the models separately as a sensitivity analysis, because of their known association with reduced HRV (20).
Within-Pair Analysis We performed within-pair analyses that examined differences
in HRV between twins that were discordant for PTSD. This analysis inherently controls for demographic, shared familial, and early environmental inﬂuences; in addition, daily activities, season, and other environmental factors during the ambulatory ECG recording are controlled in this analysis, because co-twins were examined at the same time and under nearly identical conditions. We ﬁtted GEE models adapted for twin research (42), which allow for examination of HRV effects within and between twin pairs as a function PTSD and other possible confounders. In these models the within-pair parameter is the individual twin variation from the twin pair average. This coefﬁcient is identical to the coefﬁcient from a model that ﬁts the absolute difference between the cotwins (42). A similar analysis was done for combat exposure (CES) as well as for PTSD severity (CAPS) as continuous measures. In such cases, discordance was measured on a continuous scale, because the difference in score between brothers and all pairs with differences Ͼ zero were considered discordant.
Genetic Inﬂuences In addition to sharing early environment, MZ twins share
100% of their genes, whereas DZ twins share on average 50% of their genetic material; therefore, if a signiﬁcant within-pair association is found in DZ but not in MZ twins, this suggests genetic confounding (i.e., similar genetic inﬂuences underlie PTSD and HRV) (41). If, by contrast, within-pair associations are similar in MZ and DZ twin pairs, then genes may not be considered as a confounder in the association. To statistically measure the difference in effect between MZ and DZ, we tested for the interaction of the within-pair effect with zygosity.
Results
Baseline Characteristics Of the 562 twins in the dataset, usable HRV data were
available on 459 (80%). The mean age Ϯ SD was 55.5 Ϯ 3.1 years, 46% served in Southeast Asia, 95% were Caucasian, and 3% were black. Forty-six percent of twins had reported some combat trauma exposure (CES Ͼ0); of these, the median CES score was 10 (interquartile range, 5–17), and all of them served in Southeast Asia. Seventy-four (16%) had PTSD in their lifetime; of these, 31 had current PTSD, whereas 43 had remitted PTSD. Thirty-ﬁve of 43 twins with remitted PTSD and 30 of 31 twins with current PTSD were exposed to military combat. The 103 twins with missing HRV data were more likely to be smokers (37% vs. 23%) but otherwise had characteristics similar to those without missing HRV data.

Twins with current and remitted PTSD were compared with those without PTSD (Table 1). Those with current or remitted PTSD were older, less likely to be employed, and more likely to smoke, to have served in Vietnam, to be taking antidepressants, and to have a history of drug and alcohol abuse, heart disease, and major depression. No remarkable difference was found among groups with regard to current alcohol or caffeinated beverage consumption, physical activity, cholesterol levels, body mass index, and WHR.
PTSD and HRV Current PTSD was associated with signiﬁcantly lower HRV for
all spectra except ULF in bivariate analysis (Table 2). In analyses adjusted for demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity, body mass index, history of substance abuse, major depression and, use of antidepressants, current PTSD continued to show signiﬁcant associations with VLF and LF HRV, with the largest adjusted effect size being a 39% lower LF HRV (p Ͻ .001). Similar associations were found within 20 twin pairs discordant for current PTSD (Table 2), and no signiﬁcant interaction between PTSD and zygosity was found. In contrast, remitted PTSD was not associated with a lower HRV. Twins with remitted PTSD actually tended to have higher HRV than twins without PTSD; this was noted both in analyses of twins as individuals and the 29 within twin pairs discordant for remitted PTSD. Figure 1 illustrates the associations of VLF, LF, and HF HRV with current and remitted PTSD within discordant twin pairs. Results were similar when analyses were limited to individuals without previous history of coronary heart disease (n ¼ 409). Generalized anxiety disorder (n ¼ 9) and panic disorder (n ¼ 5) occurred infrequently and did not signiﬁcantly alter results when added to the models.
Combat Exposure and HRV Combat exposure was reported in 84% of twins with current
or remitted PTSD and 39% of twins without PTSD. In individual twins, the combat exposure score, as a continuous measurement, was signiﬁcantly associated with all frequencies of HRV (Table 3). After multivariate adjustment, all frequencies except VLF and HF remained signiﬁcantly associated with the combat exposure scale score. The largest effect size was seen for LF, where a 9-point (interquartile range) increase in CES score was associated with a nearly 10% adjusted decrease in LF HRV (p ¼ .04). Similar results were found within 132 pairs discordant for combat exposure, deﬁned as a within-pair differences Ͼ zero, where twins with a higher combat exposure than their brothers showed a 13% adjusted lower LF HRV/each 9-point CES difference (p Ͻ .01). However, the associations with HRV were substantially reduced (Table 3), when current PTSD was additionally controlled for. The largest reduction in effect size was found for LF power, where adjustment for current PTSD reduced the association by over 50% (from À8.9% to À4.2%), followed by VLF, were the association was reduced by 34%. The Sobel’s test conﬁrmed that current PTSD was a statistically signiﬁcant mediator of CES for both VLF (Z score ¼ 2.16, p ¼ .03) and LF (Z score ¼ 3.0, p ¼ .003) HRV, whereas mediation was not signiﬁcant for the other frequency ranges. Among veterans not exposed to combat (n ¼ 247), service in Southeast Asia (n ¼ 14) was not signiﬁcantly associated with HRV.

Discussion
In a large, predominantly healthy sample of middle-aged veteran men, we found a robust association between current PTSD and impaired autonomic modulation measured by means of 24-hour HRV. Combat exposure was also associated with lower HRV; however, this association was mainly accounted for by current PTSD, suggesting that autonomic inﬂexibility in individuals exposed to combat trauma is in large part mediated by PTSD. By studying twins, who share 50%–100% genes and early familial inﬂuences, we were able to show that this association was independent of genetic, familial, and sociodemographic factors. Results were also overall robust to adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, depression, and history of substance abuse. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate a doseresponse relationship between PTSD symptom severity and HRV. In contrast, we found a mostly null association between remitted PTSD and autonomic function, suggesting possible reversibility of autonomic dysregulation after PTSD symptom resolution.
Our ﬁndings add to a growing literature linking exposure to combat trauma and PTSD with adverse health outcomes. Combat

linked to both psychiatric conditions (26,44) and adverse health related outcomes (19,34), our ﬁnding of reduced autonomic ﬂexibility in those with increasing levels of combat exposure and PTSD provides mechanistic insight to explain these previous ﬁndings. Importantly, our data show that the effects of exposure to combat trauma on autonomic function largely occur through PTSD, because we observed that the association was reduced after adjustment for current PTSD. Our study corroborates previous ﬁndings showing that combat exposure had only an indirect effect on health status, through PTSD (45).
Previous studies of HRV and PTSD have primarily focused on short-term HRV measures and have yielded conﬂicting results. Although some studies have found an association between PTSD and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (22,46), which is similar to HF HRV (47), others have not (26,48). These studies were limited by small sample sizes (n Ͻ 100), and did not adjust or only partially adjusted for potential confounding factors. In our data the association between current PTSD and HF HRV was weakened in multivariable analysis, suggesting that it is confounded by other risk factors. One of the reasons behind the difference between our ﬁndings of HF HRV and that of respiratory sinus arrhythmia in some of the previous studies is our use of 24-hour measures, which are subject to additional variability, because of changes in position (18). In contrast to HF, the association with LF and VLF HRV was robust to adjusting for potential confounding factors and was conﬁrmed in within-pair analyses.
On the basis of previous studies, LF power is a reﬂection of baroreﬂex sensitivity (BRS) (49); therefore, our results could imply

reduced BRS in individuals with current PTSD. These ﬁndings are consistent with a reported association between mental stress and reduced BRS (49). Additionally, reduced BRS might explain the lack of a signiﬁcant heart rate response to acute stress found in people with PTSD (22). Both reduced BRS and reduced 24-hour ambulatory LF HRV power are associated with mortality and have important prognostic signiﬁcance after myocardial infarction (50,51). According to Porges’ polyvagal theory, reduced LF HRV might also suggest vagal insufﬁciency that arises from defects in

the dorsal motor nucleus (15). This is consistent with other studies showing impaired vagal modulation, as assessed by low short-term respiratory sinus arrhythmia in subjects with PTSD and other anxiety disorders (20). Although some studies have reported higher short-term normalized LF (which differs from 24-hour LF power) in PTSD, our ﬁnding of lower 24-hour LF HRV is consistent with Porges’ polyvagal theory (20).
Very-low-frequency power, a long-term frequency measure of HRV, was also signiﬁcantly lower in twins with PTSD in our study.

A.J. Shah et al.
Very-low frequency is a strong prognostic indicator in patients with myocardial infarction (52) and is thought to measure slow autonomic adjustments to changes in vasomotor tone (53). This association might imply decreased thermoregulation and increased renin-angiotensin system activity in persons with PTSD (47). In contrast, we found no consistent association between PTSD and ULF power, which is an important difference with previous research showing associations between depression and ULF HRV and suggests a different physiologic response between PTSD and depression (44).
This study is subject to some limitations. Our sample consisted of middle-aged men, primarily Caucasian; and therefore the ﬁndings might not be generalizable to other demographic groups. The design was cross-sectional, and thus temporal order in the reported associations is difﬁcult to discern. The number of subjects with current PTSD was relatively small, thus limiting the precision of our estimates particularly after stratiﬁcation for other factors such as zygosity. Despite this, many within-pair associations were signiﬁcant, thus demonstrating that—overall—our ﬁndings were quite robust.
Conclusions In this study of male veteran twins, both combat exposure and
PTSD were associated with measures of autonomic inﬂexibility that have clinical relevance for cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, the impact of combat exposure on HRV seemed to be mostly mediated by PTSD. Our results suggest that lack of autonomic modulation is a plausible mechanism by which combat trauma, through the development of PTSD, might inﬂuence cardiovascular health. Given the growing number of veterans with PTSD from recent wars, our ﬁndings underscore the importance of appropriate care in these at-risk individuals, because it might yield both psychiatric and cardiovascular beneﬁts.
