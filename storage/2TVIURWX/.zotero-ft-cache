Abstract 
The current consensus is that most natural categories are not organized around strict definitions (a list of singly necessary and jointly sufficient features) but rather according to a family resemblance (FR) principle: Objects belong to the same category because they are similar to each other and dissimilar to objects in contrast categories. A number of computational models of category construction have been developed to provide an account of how and why people create FR categories [Anderson, 1990]; [Fisher, 1987]. Surprisingly, however, only a few experiments on category construction or free sorting have been run and they suggest that people do not sort examples by the FR principle. We report several new experiments and a two-stage model for category construction. This model is contrasted with a variety of other models with respect to their ability to account for when FR sorting will and will not occur. The experiments serve to identify one basis for FR sorting and to support the two-stage model. The distinctive property of the two-stage model is that it assumes that people impose more structure than the examples support in the first stage and that the second stage adjusts for this difference between preferred and perceived structure. We speculate that people do not simply assimilate probabilistic structures but rather organize them in terms of discrete structures plus noise.

Abstract 
Retrieving the answer to a general knowledge question has been shown to involve two metacognitive processes—a feeling-of-knowing that initiates the search of long-term memory and a willingness to continue searching until an answer can be confidently stated. To extend this model, college students were asked to retrieve as many members of 2 natural categories as they could in 1 min. Examination of the points at which they switched categories revealed that they searched longer in categories of higher potency, and they switched earlier when the other category was of higher potency. They also searched the first category longer when they were allowed to switch only once during a trial rather than as often as they wished. It was concluded that feeling-of-knowing maintained search of a category and also contributed to the willingness to continue searching, and the constraint on switching impacted the willingness to continue.

Barbara C. Malt, Brian H. Ross, Gregory L. Murphy 
 
Abstract 
An important function of concepts is to allow the prediction of unseen features. A Bayesian account of feature prediction suggests that people will consider all the categories an object could belong to when they judge the likelihood that the object has a feature. The judgment and decision literature suggests that they may instead use a simpler heuristic in which they consider only the most likely category. In 3 experiments, no evidence was found that participants took into account alternative categories as well as the most likely one when they judged feature probabilities for familiar objects in meaningful contexts. These results, in conjunction with those of Murphy and Ross (1994), suggest that although people may consider alternative categories in certain limited situations, they often do not. Reasons for why the use of alternative categories may be relatively rare are discussed, and conditions under which people may take alternative categories into account are outlined.

You are entitled to access the full text of this document   What is behavior? And so what? 
New Ideas in Psychology , Volume 29, Issue 2, August 2011, Pages 147-155 
 
Abstract 
This article addresses a longstanding problem in the field of psychology, that of lacking an adequate explication of what is arguably our central concept as a " science of behavior," the concept of " behavior" itself. The three sections comprising the paper are devoted, respectively, to (a) presenting a conceptual formulation of behavior; (b) discussing this formulation by, among other things, addressing objections to it and noting its advantages over psychology's currently preferred definition of behavior as observable activity; and (c) relating why having such a formulation is important. The final section includes several uses to which the present formulation has already been and can in future be put, including a sketch of how it may be used to integrate the various subfields of our currently fragmented science of behavior. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrast and assimilation in categorization and exemplar production 
Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics , Volume 73, Issue 2, February 2011, Pages 621-639 
 
Abstract 
We studied contrast and assimilation in three tasks: an exemplar-production task, a categorization task, and a combined categorization-then-production task. On each trial of the first task, subjects produced a circle when prompted with a category label. In the second task, they classified lines that differed in length into one of four categories. On each trial of the combined task, they classified two lines and then produced a line when prompted by a category label. All three tasks converged on the same conclusion: subjects' representation of the categories (measured in pixels in the production tasks and by the direction of errors in classification) shifted systematically from trial to trial. When successive stimuli were from the same category, the representation of that category was pulled toward the exemplar from the previous trial. When successive stimuli were from different categories, the representations of the neighbouring categories were pushed from the category of the initial stimulus. We conclude that accounts of categorization and identification must accommodate both assimilation and contrast as a function of trial-to-trial shifts in representation. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2010.

Art concept pluralism 
Metaphilosophy , Volume 42, Issues 1-2, January 2011, Pages 83-97 
 
Abstract 
There is a long tradition of trying to analyze art either by providing a definition (essentialism) or by tracing its contours as an indefinable, open concept (anti-essentialism). Both art essentialists and art anti-essentialists share an implicit assumption of art concept monism. This article argues that this assumption is a mistake. Species concept pluralism - a well-explored position in philosophy of biology - provides a model for art concept pluralism. The article explores the conditions under which concept pluralism is appropriate, and argues that they obtain for art. Art concept pluralism allows us to recognize that different art concepts are useful for different purposes, and what has been feuding definitions can be seen as characterizations of specific art concepts. © 2011 The Authors.

Abstract 
Categorization is the ability to treat similar but nonidentical things as somehow equivalent, by sorting them into their proper categories and by reacting to them similarly. The underlying processes vary from purely perceptual mechanisms (object constancy) to memorization of absolute stimulus elements, feature learning, associative and functional classifications to various kinds of concept formation. Although language is no precondition for categorization, it enables us to form and manipulate classes in a nearly infinite manner by using symbolic representations and by attaching verbal labels to them. Recent research has revealed that nonhuman animals can form concepts that are based on inferential logic.

Abstract 
Semantic memory refers to the enormous storehouse of information that humans have readily accessible. This chapter provides a general overview of both theory development and empirical research investigating the nature of semantic memory. Rather than focusing on one or two theoretical approaches, we attempt to provide an overview of multiple ways of conceptualizing semantics to capture the rich theoretical perspectives that have developed in this literature. We provide reviews of such issues as hierarchical network models, feature-based models, recent attempts to ground semantics in large-scale databases, embodied cognition, and graph theoretical approaches. We also review semantic and episodic priming studies, along with research addressing the interplay between semantic and episodic memory. Finally, recent advances from both neuropsychological case studies and neuro imaging studies are discussed with a particular emphasis on how this work informs theoretical accounts of semantic memory.
