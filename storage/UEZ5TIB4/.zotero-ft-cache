1974.-Observations

on hematocrit

(Hct) and

hemoglobin

(Hb) were Inade in six men before and after running

long enough to cause a 4y0 decrease in body weight. Subscripts B

and A were used to denote before dehydration

and after dehydra-

tion, respectively.

Relations were derived between BVn, BVA,

Hbn, HbA, Hctg, and HctA with which one can calculate the per-

centage decreases in BV, CV, and PV, as well as the concentration

of hemoglobin

in red cells, g. 100 ml-l (MCHC).

When subjects

reach the same level of dehydration

the water loss from the various

body compartments

may vary reflecting difference in salt losses in

sweat. Changes in PV calculated from the increase in plasma pro-

tein concentration

averaged - 7.5(z compared with - 12.2 y0

calculated from changes in Hb and Hct. The difference could be

accounted for by a loss of 6v10 plasma protein from the circulation.

The results for each man and the means are shown in Table 1 l

The following explanation will make the method clear, using the

mean values of the table.

After dehydration

what volume of blood contains 15.1 g Hb?

16.7:lOO = 15.1 :x and x = 90.4 KJ

Hence, the decrease in blood volume is 9.6yG.

After dehydration

Hct A is 0.453 and the volume of cells in 90.4

ml of blood is 0.453 X 90.4 = 41 .O ml. Hence the hemoglobin in

the original 43.7 ml is now contained in 41 .O, a decrease of 6.3y0

DEHYDRATION

WHEN MAN is acutely dehydrated

plasma volulne (PV) decreases:

Adolph has postulated that only protein-free

filtrate leaves the

bloodstream

and that the increase in concentration

of protein in

plasma can be used to calculate the percentage decrease in PV (1).

However, Dill et al. (3) have shown that this postulate is not valid

for all subjects, at least in desert walks of 1 h or more. On the other

hand, the protein of red cells, hemoglobin,

cannot leave the red

cells let alone the blood. This suggests using measurement

of con-

centration of hemoglobin

in blood and percentage

of red cells in

blood before and after dehydration

to estimate percentage changes

in volumes of plasma and of red cells.

Six trained men ran on a motor-driven

treadmill for 2 h at from

60 to 75% Of VOz max. The ambient temperature

was 22.2 =i= 0.4OC

and the relative humidity 40-45 $& Venous blood was drawn from

the antecubital vein of the reclining subject before exercise and 30

min after the run. The hematocrit (Hct) was measured in triplicate

with a microhematocrit

centrifuge and corrected for 4?& plasma

trapped with the packed red cells. Hemoglobin

(Hb) was meas-

ured by the cyanmethemoglobin

method. Standard Hb curves

were established with a standard supplied by Hycel, Inc. Percent-

age changes in blood volume (BV), red cell volume (CV), and

plasma volume (PV) were calculated from values for Hb and Hct

in each of the six men before and after losing 4’;; of body weight

using the relations that follow. The subscripts B and ,4 refer to

red cells of 2.2 g 100 ml-l or 6.3(,>;. This L checks with the 6 .3 c;;/;!de-

crease in CV shown in Table 1.

DISCUSSiON

What are the constraints that determine the sources of water

used for body cooling? One constraint involves protein concentra-

tion: less water is surrendered

by intracellular

spaces with their

high protein concentration

than by extracellular

spaces. This con-

straint and others have been pictured by the Henderson alignment

charts relating the physicochemical

properties of blood to CO2

and 02 movements in the respiratory cycle. For example, in work

involving a sevenfold increase in oxygen consumption

the Hct

changed from 44.0 in arterial blood to 44.7 in venous blood (2). Or

if the pH of arterial blood were increased by hyperventilation

from

7.35 to 7.45, Fig. 6 of that reference indicates that the Hct would

decrease from 44.0 to 43.5.

While the most obvious event in dehydration

is loss of water in

sweat, the accompanying

loss of electrolytes also must be con-

sidered. The osmotic pressure of sweat is about one-fourth that of

blood plasma but it varies greatly. The mean chloride concentra-

tion in the sweat of 12 men was found to be 32.9 meq -1-l but the

range was from 18.2 to 65.4, a ratio of nearly 1 to 4 (3). It is likely

that the large range in responses seen in Table 1 is due in part to

differences in salt loss in sweat.

Still another variable on which the physicochemical

equilibrium

in blood depends is body temperature:

change of temperature

modifies the base-binding

of protein. This was not a factor under

our conditions since the body temperature

had returned to the

control level when the second blood was drawn.

Table 1 includes observations on plasma protein concentrations

before and after dehydration.

Values for A PV calculated from

these concentrations

are considerably

smaller than A PV calcu-

lated from Hb and Hct except for subject G whose values were equal.

The order of differences for the two methods of estimating A PY

was roughly the same from subject to subject; the highest values
were in subjects .Y, 5, and G‘. The mean A PV’s were - 7.5 (,‘;, by the

plasma protein method vs. - 12.2 (J(, by our method. This dif-ler-

ence suggests considerable loss of protein from the circulation. Had

none of the proteins left the circulating plasma then the 12.2”;

loss of plasma water woulcl have resulted in a plasma protein con-

centration of 8.29 g. 100 ml? Since plasma protein concentration

was only 7.87 g. 100 ml-l, then the loss of protein from plasma was

8.29 - 7.87 or 0.42 gc. 100 ml-‘, equivalent initial concentration.

to about St,‘;) of the

Based on the preceding discussion it is apparent that the changes

in blood volume, cell volume, and plasma volume can be calcu-

lated from measurements

of hemo$obin

and hematocrit.

Unlike

computation

of 70 A PV based solely on changes in Hct (4), the

equations illustrated here are not distorted by alterations in the

volume of the red blood cells.
