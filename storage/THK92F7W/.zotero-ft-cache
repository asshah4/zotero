patient neural inspiration to peak inspiratory ﬂow (V˙ TI/V˙ peak)

termination, depending on patient mechanics. An increase in

␶/TI causes more delayed and less premature termination

opportunities. An increase in Pps/Pmus max narrows the

synchronized zone, making inspiratory termination predis-

posed to be in asynchrony. Increasing the expiratory trigger

sensitivity of a ventilator shifts the synchronized zone to the

right, causing less delayed and more premature termination.

Automation of expiratory trigger sensitivity in future mechani-

mechanical ventilation; patient-ventilator synchrony; mathematical modeling

PRESSURE SUPPORT VENTILATION (PSV) has been one of the most frequently applied modes for partial ventilatory support. Because patients under PSV have control of the ventilatory rate and the inspiratory assist time, they feel more comfortable with PSV than with other partial ventilatory support modes (e.g., synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation) (11). Nevertheless, recent clinical studies have revealed that patients under PSV may frequently encounter patientventilator asynchrony. Ventilators may not be in synchrony with the onset of the patient inspiratory effort, which causes

inspiratory asynchrony (or trigger asynchrony). Studies on inspiratory asynchrony have indicated that inspiratory asynchrony is related to a high patient work in breathing and difficulty in weaning patients from the mechanical ventilation (7, 8). In addition, patient-ventilator asynchrony may also be present during the onset of exhalation, i.e., expiratory asynchrony (9, 10, 14, 16). In this situation, the termination of the ventilator ﬂow occurs either before or after patients stop their inspiratory efforts. Expiratory asynchrony not only causes discomfort to patients but costs patients unnecessary inspiratory and expiratory work as well (12). When the termination of the ventilator ﬂow falls behind the end of the patient inspiratory effort (i.e., delayed termination), the patient recruits his expiratory muscles to ‘‘ﬁght’’ against the ventilator ﬂow, which increases expiratory workload (10). When the termination of the ventilator ﬂow occurs before the end of the patient inspiratory effort (i.e., premature termination), inspiratory muscle work continues into or even throughout the ventilator’s expiratory phase, thus resulting in inefficient inspiratory muscle work (16). Furthermore, a high lung volume caused by the previous breath with delayed termination may result in trigger failure of the subsequent inspiratory effort in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (14). Premature termination in PSV, on the other hand, sometimes causes retriggering of inspiration and a stuttering pattern of ventilator assistance (16). Although expiratory asynchrony has been of clinical concern for years, there are very few studies exploring the mechanisms of expiratory asynchrony (20). Younes (20) used computer simulation to evaluate the effects of selected levels of respiratory mechanics and patient effort on the duration of ventilator assistance time during PSV. Because his presentation was limited to relatively few, selected levels of resistance, compliance, and patient effort, more general relationships governing expiratory asynchrony cannot be deduced.
Flow cycling is the primary method for intensive care ventilators to terminate their inspiratory ﬂow delivery during PSV. The ventilator is cycled off when the inspiratory ﬂow has decayed to a certain level (i.e., termination criterion). Most current ventilators use an arbitrary termination criterion to terminate the inspiratory ﬂow delivery during PSV (e.g., 5% of the peak ﬂow in the Siemens Servo 300, 25% of the peak ﬂow in the Siemens Servo 900 and Bird 8400ST, 5 l/min in the Nellcor Puritan Bennett 7200ae). These arbitrary criteria have been shown to cause expiratory asynchrony in certain patient categories. Van de Graaff and co-workers (16) found that patients with prolonged and slow inspiratory efforts sometimes suffered premature termination under PSV with the Siemens Servo 900C ventilator. With this same ventilator, Jubran et al. (10) revealed delayed termination of ventilator ﬂow in patients with a long time constant and a high support pressure level. In a mechanical simulation study evaluating expiratory synchrony during PSV in different ventilators (17), we identiﬁed a delayed ventilator ﬂow termination with

MECHANISMS OF EXPIRATORY ASYNCHRONY IN PSV

weak inspiratory effort and long time constant using the Siemens Servo300. Surprisingly, ventilator ﬂow was never cycled off by the ﬂow criterion with the Nellcor Puritan Bennett 7200ae in the tested conditions.
With the understanding that a single level of the ﬂow criterion in a speciﬁc ventilator probably would not satisfy all patient categories and the chances of premature termination and delayed termination are always likely, some ventilator manufacturers have introduced user-selectable termination criteria into their newest model ventilators in an effort to improve expiratory synchrony (e.g., Nellcor Puritan Bennett 840, Hamilton Galileo). Clinicians can select a termination ﬂow criterion (expiratory trigger sensitivity) to optimize the expiratory synchrony. This function, although it provides ﬂexibility to clinicians, breaks the simplicity of the application of PSV and has been shown to be difficult even with visual observation of the bedside airway pressure waveform (4, 6). Part of the difficulty in using this function is attributed to lack of clariﬁcation of the mechanisms of expiratory asynchrony in different patient mechanic conditions during PSV.
To better understand the mechanisms of expiratory asynchrony caused by the ﬂow termination criteria in PSV of mechanical ventilators, we developed a mathematical model. Solving this model revealed that expiratory synchrony is governed by two ratios: the ratio of the respiratory time constant (␶) to patient neural inspiratory time (TI) and the ratio of the ventilator set pressure support level (Pps) to patient inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus). The use of this model for automation of expiratory trigger sensitivity in the development of future mechanical ventilators is also possible.

METHODS

The Model

During partial ventilatory support, the motion of the respiratory system can be represented by the single ﬁrstorder differential Eq. 1, with the assumption that inertial losses are negligible and that the pressure-ﬂow and pressurevolume relationships are linear in the range of tidal ventilation.

Paw(t) ϩ Pmus(t) ϭ R · V˙ (t) ϩ E · ⌬V(t)

(1)

where at any instant (t), the volume displacement [⌬V(t)] from the end-expiratory level and the instantaneous ﬂow
[V˙ (t)] are determined by the total driving pressure applied to
the respiratory system, i.e., the time varying airway pressure (Paw) and patient-generated Pmus. R and E represent the resistance and elastance of the respiratory system, respectively.
On the basis of this differential equation, the inspiratory ﬂow waveform during PSV can be solved analytically by assuming the form of the input pressure signals Paw(t) and Pmus(t).
Paw(t) is simulated by assuming that the ventilator is triggered as soon as inspiratory effort succeeds in either generating inspiratory ﬂow or reducing Paw below the baseline pressure level (here assumed to be zero). Once the ventilator is triggered, Paw is assumed to exponentially increase to the Pps level with a ventilator time constant (␶v) and then maintain that level until the termination of inspiration (Fig. 1). Thus

Paw(t) ϭ Pps(1 Ϫ eϪt/␶v)

(2)

Fig. 1. Model-derived time courses of airway pressure (Paw; top) and inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus; bottom). When the ventilator is triggered, Paw is assumed to exponentially increase to the set pressure support level (Pps) with a time constant of ␶v. Pmus is approximated by a second-order polynomial function during neural inspiration time (TI). After the end of inspiration, Pmus decays exponentially during the entire expiration with a nearly linear decline (at a slope of ␣) during the ﬁrst 0.1 s. Pmus max, maximal Pmus; t, time.

where t Ն 0. The time course of Pmus can be approximated by the following second-order polynomial function (13)

Pmus(t) ϭ Ϫd · (t Ϫ TI)2 ϩ d · TI2

where d is a constant; TI is deﬁned as the time between the onset of the increase in inspiratory Pmus and the start of its decline. It is assumed that Pmus reaches its maximum and becomes ﬂattened at the end of the neural inspiratory effort (t ϭ TI); thus the maximal Pmus (Pmus max) can be expressed as Pmus max ϭ d · TI2. Substituting this into the above equation yields the expression

MECHANISMS OF EXPIRATORY ASYNCHRONY IN PSV

2145

This is a fundamental equation describing the inspiratory

ﬂow proﬁle during PSV, which implies that the ﬂow proﬁle as

the function of normalized time (t/TI) is determined by

Pps/Pmus max, ␶/TI, and ␶v/TI. Furthermore, this equation also implies that, during PSV at a given level of ␶v/TI, the ratio of the ﬂow at the end of patient neural inspiration to peak
inspiratory ﬂow (V˙ TI/V˙ peak) can be uniquely expressed and
graphically plotted on the plane of Pps/Pmus max vs. ␶/TI.

This provides the framework for the following analyses.
Computation of V˙ TI/V˙ peak. To simplify the calculations,
␶V/TI is assumed to be 0.06. This ␶V/TI value represents cases in which, for example, patient neural TI is 1.0 s and ventilator

␶V is 0.06 s [␶V of 0.06 s corresponds to the ﬂow acceleration percent setting of 90% in the Nellcor Puritan Bennett 840

ventilator (15)]. The inspiratory ﬂow rates at t during PSV

over the entire TI were then computed with Eq. 5 by step-
wise changing Pps/Pmus max and ␶/TI. ˙Vpeak and V˙ TI were
determined in these calculations. In this study, Pps/Pmus-

max was changed from 0.1 to 3.0 (at 0.1 intervals) and ␶/TI

from 0.1 to 2.0 (at 0.1 intervals). In this way, we obtained 30 ϫ
20 matrices for ˙Vpeak and V˙ TI, which yielded V˙ TI/V˙ peak on the
Pps/Pmus max-␶/TI plane. To evaluate the separate effects of
␶/TI and Pps/Pmus max on V˙ TI/V˙ peak, V˙ TI/V˙ peak values as a
function of ␶/TI (ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 at 0.1 intervals) at ﬁve

different levels of Pps/Pmus max (i.e., 1/3, 2/3, 1, 2, 3) were

also plotted.
V˙ TI/V˙ peak at the ranges of adult respiratory mechanics.
Because expiratory asynchrony has been experienced primar-

ily in adult applications of PSV (9, 10, 14, 16), we calculated
V˙ TI/V˙ peak values at wide ranges of adult respiratory mechan-
ics. The respiratory mechanics used were lung compliance of

0.08, 0.04, and 0.02 l/cmH2O; chest wall compliance of 0.2 l/cmH2O; respiratory resistance of 5 and 20 cmH2O · lϪ1 · sϪ1;
Pps of 10, 20, and 30 cmH2O; and Pmus max of 10 and 30
cmH2O. The patient neural TI was assumed to be 1.0 s and ␶v/TI was the same as described above.
Expiratory synchrony with representative termination crite-

ria. Two representative termination criteria were chosen in

this study: 25 and 5% of peak inspiratory ﬂow. This means

that the ventilator is cycled off when the inspiratory ﬂow

decays to the level that is equal to the threshold level, i.e., 25

or 5% of peak inspiratory ﬂow. With the use of these termina-

tion criteria, the ventilator will be in expiratory synchrony

with is in

tahseynpcahtireonntyifwV˙itThI/V˙thpeeakpiasteieqnutalwthoetnheV˙tThIr/Ve˙spheaokldislehvieglh. eIrt

than (delayed termination) or lower than (premature termina-

tion) the threshold level. When V˙ TI/V˙ peak is higher than the

threshold level at the end of patient neural inspiration,

however, the decline in Pmus after neural inspiration aug-

ments the ﬂow decay so as to decelerate ﬂow to reach the

threshold subsequently. Effect of the Pmus decline on the ﬂow

decay can be approximated as ⌬Pmus/R. Physiologically, the

cessation of Pmus is not instantaneous; rather, the inspira-

tory muscle activity generally extends into the expiratory

phase, resulting in residual inspiratory Pmus during neural

expiration (13). In anesthetized humans and animals (2, 21),

although the time course of the inspiratory Pmus during the

entire expiration follows a curvilinear relationship, it is

almost a linear decay during the ﬁrst 0.1 s of the expiration.

This is also supported by our data from the patients under

mechanical ventilation with PSV (18). Taking this Pmus

decay pattern into consideration, we designate the rate of the

Pmus decline (in percent) during the ﬁrst 0.1 s of expiration

as ␣ (Fig. 1), i.e., Pmus is assumed to decay by ␣ ϫ Pmus max.

Therefore, the contribution of the Pmus decline to the ﬂow

decay after the end of TI would be modiﬁed to ␣ ϫ Pmus max/

R. If we consider the delayed ventilator ﬂow terminations of

up to 0.1 s as synchronous terminations, the conditions of synchronous terminations can be written as

V˙ TI ˙Vpeak Ն 0.25 (or 0.05)

The right side of Eq. 6 (upper limit) can be calculated using Eq. 5, generating a matrix distributed on the Pps/Pmus max-
␶/TI plane. Comparing elements in V˙ TI/V˙ peak with both the
lower limit (i.e., 0.25 or 0.05) matrix and the upper limit matrix, we obtained the zone for synchronous termination on
the plane. The asynchronous zones were deﬁned if V˙ TI/V˙ peak
was higher than the upper limit (delayed termination) or lower than the lower limit (premature termination).
Although results from humans and animals with normal respiratory functions indicate that inspiratory Pmus decreases by ϳ25% in the ﬁrst 0.1 s (2, 21), the value of ␣ in this study was assumed to be 25 and 50% because a higher level of ␣ may represent the condition in which a sudden expiratory muscle activity augments the inspiratory ﬂow decay (1).

the inspiratory termination predisposed to be in asynchrony (delayed or premature termination). When the patient mechanics remain unchanged, increasing the expiratory trigger sensitivity of a ventilator shifts the synchronized zone to the right, in general causing less delayed termination and more premature termination. An increase in ␣ (indicating a faster Pmus decay or expiratory muscle activity) broadens the synchronous zone and narrows the delayed termination zone.

DISCUSSION

Pmus max slightly shifts the V˙ TI/V˙ peak-␶/TI curve to the
right.
V˙ TI/V˙ peak at the Ranges of Adult
Respiratory Mechanics
Under adult respiratory mechanics, V˙ TI/V˙ peak ranges
from 1 to 85% (Table 1). It is affected more strongly by ␶/TI of the respiratory system than by Pps/Pmus max. Analysis using linear regression reveals an excellent
correlation between the V˙ TI/V˙ peak and ␶/TI within the
selected mechanic ranges, with a correlation coefficient of Ն0.96 (Table 2).
Expiratory Synchrony With Representative Termination Criteria
Expiratory synchronies with representative termination criteria are shown in Fig. 4. Single ﬁxed levels of the termination criterion, no matter how much they are, always have chances of both synchronized termination and premature as well as delayed termination, depending on the Pps, Pmus, ␶ of the respiratory system, and patient neural TI. An increase in ␶/TI causes greater opportunity of delayed termination and less chance of premature termination. An increase in Pps/Pmus max narrows the synchronized zone, making

Analysis of the mechanisms of expiratory asynchrony

could be done with a mathematical model, computer

simulation, mechanical model simulation, or even ani-

mal and/or human studies. Because it is difficult or

unrealistic to manipulate the potentially involved pa-

rameters in animals and humans, animal and human

studies do not ﬁt well for this type of study. Mechanical

model simulation and computer simulation have advan-

tages because many parameters can be manipulated in

a controlled manner and can be designed in a way that

is mechanically closer to human physiology than math-

ematical models. However, the use of a mathematical

model approach, with some assumptions and simpliﬁca-

tions, allows easier elucidation of the basic rules behind

expiratory asynchrony than the use of other ap-

proaches. In this study, we assumed the pressure-

volume relationship to be linear in the range of tidal

ventilation. We also assumed the pressure-ﬂow relation-

ship to be linear so that we could solve the mathemati-

cal model. This assumption, especially in intubated

patients, is not true because the real pressure-ﬂow

relationship is more of nonlinearity. This nonlinearity
will attenuate the peak ﬂow and reduce V˙ TI/V˙ peak, thus,
in general, shifting the results presented here toward

delayed termination. We could incorporate trigger de-

lay time (Tdelay) and trigger pressure (Ptrigger) into the model by changing TI, Pmus, and Pps to TI Ϫ Tdelay, Pmus max Ϫ Ptrigger, and Pps ϩ Ptrigger, predisposing to
delayed terminations; however, in the model, we as-

sumed that the ventilator is triggered as soon as the

patient starts inspiratory efforts for the simplicity of

data presentation. The airway pressure waveform in

the model was characterized by an exponential curve

with a variable rate constant (1/␶v), which incorporated changes in the slope of the pressurization. To simplify

the data presentation, we ﬁxed ␶v /TI at 0.06, which represents cases in which the patient TI is 1.0 s and the

ventilator time constant is 0.06 s (␶v of 0.06 s corresponds to the ﬂow acceleration setting of 90% in the

Nellcor Puritan Bennett 840 ventilator). On the basis of

what we presented in this study. This is consistent with

the results from Bonmarchand et al. (3) who found that

promoting delayed termination of inspiration. In the

reality; however, they are helpful and allow an in-depth

mathematical analysis of the mechanisms of expiratory

asynchrony in PSV.

With these assumptions and simpliﬁcations being

kept in mind, this mathematical model study reveals

the following results during PSV. 1) The ratio of the
ﬂow at the end of patient V˙ TI/V˙ peak during PSV is
determined by two ratios, ␶/TI and Pps/Pmus max. 2)
V˙ TI/V˙ peak is affected more by ␶/TI than by Pps/Pmus-
max. Within the data ranges presented in the Fig. 3,
V˙ TI/V˙ peak increases in a sigmoidal (s-shaped) relation-
ship to ␶/TI. An increase in Pps/Pmusmax slightly shifts

from 1 to 85% and has an excellent linear correlation

with ␶/TI. 4) Single ﬁxed levels of the ﬂow termination

criterion used in mechanical ventilators will always

have chances of both synchronized termination and

asynchronized (premature and delayed) termination,

depending on the patient mechanics. An increase in ␶/TI

causes greater opportunity of delayed termination and

less chance of premature termination. An increase in

Pps/Pmus max narrows the synchronized zone, leaving

the inspiratory termination predisposed to be in asyn-

chrony (premature or delayed termination). Increasing

the expiratory trigger sensitivity of a ventilator shifts

the synchronized zone to the right, causing less delayed

termination and more premature termination. An in-

crease in ␣ (indicating a faster Pmus decay or expira-

tory muscle activity) broadens the synchronous zone

and narrows the delayed termination zone.

this study, V˙ TI/V˙ peak turns out to be higher than 60% in
the conditions of 20 cmH2O · lϪ1 · sϪ1 resistance and 0.08
l/cmH2O compliance at a TI of 1.0 s (Table 1). This is
consistent with the ﬁndings of the delayed inspiratory

termination shown both in patients with COPD (10, 14)

and in a mechanical lung model study (17) in which the

ventilators with peak ﬂows of 5 or 25% as the termina-

tion criterion were used [the Siemens 900C (10), Taema

Cesar or Hamilton Amadeus (14), and Siemens 300

(17)]. In another study on COPD patients, Jubran and

co-workers (10) showed that 5 of their 12 studied

patients displayed expiratory effort before the cessa-

tion of inspiratory ﬂow (i.e., delayed termination).

MECHANISMS OF EXPIRATORY ASYNCHRONY IN PSV

These ﬁve patients had an average time constant of 0.54 s compared with an average time constant of 0.38 s in the patients who displayed no expiratory effort during the inspiratory phase. The delayed termination at the long time constant can be explained because the inspiratory ﬂow decay after the peak level is slower as a result of a longer time constant. The strong relation-
ship between V˙ TI/ ˙Vpeak and ␶ may also explain why
expiratory synchrony can be achieved with the ventilator (Newport E200) in which expiratory trigger sensitivity is related to the elapsed inspiratory time (17).
The direct effects of the Pps level and the magnitude
of the patient inspiratory effort (Pmus) on V˙ TI/V˙ peak
are not as important as those of ␶/TI (Fig. 3, Table 1); however, the higher the Pps/Pmus max, the narrower the synchronized zone becomes with a certain ﬂow criterion (Fig. 4). This means that the possibility of expiratory synchrony is reduced if a high level of pressure support is applied and/or the patient has a weak inspiratory effort (19). When the patient Pmus is predominant (compared with the ventilator support) in generating inspiratory ﬂow, the ventilator is predisposed to be in synchrony with the patient in terms of the inspiratory termination and vice versa. These results are consistent with the ﬁndings in the abovementioned study done by Jubran and co-workers (10) because the delayed termination existed at PSV of 20 cmH2O but disappeared at PSV of 10 and 5 cmH2O.
It is surprising to ﬁnd that, even under the adult
respiratory mechanics, V˙ TI/V˙ peak can vary in a very
wide range, from 1 to 85%. This ﬁnding explains why expiratory asynchrony occurs frequently when mechanical ventilators with a ﬁxed level of ﬂow termination criteria are used. Contrary to a ﬁxed level of ﬂow termination criteria, user-selectable expiratory trigger sensitivity in some of the most recently released ventilators (e.g., Hamilton Galileo and Nellcor Puritan Bennett 840) provides ﬂexibility, allowing clinicians to manually select the ﬂow termination criteria to achieve good patient-ventilator synchrony. However, be-
cause V˙ TI/V˙ peak may change when any of the four
parameters (Pps, Pmus, ␶, and TI) change, clinicians may need to readjust the expiratory trigger sensitivity setting very frequently. This is obviously unrealistic in routine clinical practices. Because expiratory asynchrony is a clinical concern primarily in adult appli-
cations (9, 10, 14, 16) and V˙ TI/ ˙Vpeak has an excellent
linear correlation with ␶/TI in the range of adult mechanics (with correlation coefficient Ն0.96, Table 2), the adjustment of expiratory trigger synchrony for the purpose of patient-ventilator synchrony, in theory, could easily be done automatically by the current computer technologies in mechanical ventilator applications.
Because of the assumptions and simpliﬁcations that we used in this mathematical model study, the results presented here may not be directly extrapolated to clinical application. It is especially true in terms of the data of expiratory synchrony with the representative termination criteria (Fig. 4), since our model did not take into account the role of the pressure criteria in the

inspiratory termination. The divisions of the premature, synchronized, and delayed termination zones in Fig. 4 were based on the assumption that the ventilator has only ﬂow criteria to terminate the inspiratory ﬂow. Many mechanical ventilators, in reality, are also equipped with pressure criteria as a backup to terminate the inspiration. By pressure criteria, the ventilator ﬂow is terminated when Paw rises a certain amount (e.g., ϩ1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 20.0 cmH2O in the Nellcor Puritan Bennett 7200ae, the Newport E200, the Siemens 900, and the Siemens 300 ventilators, respectively) above the Pps level. In fact, pressure criteria could become a primary method for terminating the ventilator ﬂow in some ventilators (17) if they are strict (i.e., the ventilator is cycled off at a small supraplateau pressure). The addition of a strict pressure criterion may fundamentally narrow the delayed termination zone and widen the synchronized zone, especially in patients with active expiratory efforts (at the cost of the patient expiratory work). It should be kept in mind, however, that a strict pressure criterion may cause other problems, such as premature termination of inspiration in the case of pressure variation at the plateau level.
Contribution to Already Published Work
Using computer simulation, Younes (20) evaluated the effects of patient respiratory mechanics and the level of patient inspiratory effort on the tidal volume and ventilator’s TI during PSV by choosing a few levels of resistance, compliance, and Pmus. His results indicate that, for a given level of patient resistance and compliance, expiratory asynchrony is affected by the change in the patient inspiratory effort. Although his data help to explain, in part, the mechanism of expiratory asynchrony, his approach is less likely to elucidate the general rules governing expiratory synchrony. With our simple but comprehensive mathematical formulation, however, we were able to characterize, in a ﬁrst-order approximation, the inﬂuence of ␶ (and thus resistance and compliance) in dimensionless form as the ratio ␶/TI, incorporating the effect of TI. It means that expiratory synchrony is not affected by ␶ alone but, rather, is affected by ␶/TI. Accordingly, we can conclude that changes in ␶ could result in different levels of expiratory asynchrony dependent on the patient’s adjustment of neural TI: if TI is changed proportionally to maintain a constant value of ␶/TI, there would be no change in expiratory asynchrony. In the same way, expiratory synchrony is governed by the balance in relative weight between patient effort magnitude (Pmus) and ventilator support level (Pps) in the manner of the ratio Pps/Pmus and not by the individual values of Pps or Pmus. As shown in Fig. 4, when the patient Pmus is predominant compared with the ventilator support pressure, the ventilator is predisposed to be in synchrony with the patient’s expiration. In contrast, when ventilator support pressure overwhelms the patient inspiratory effort, expiratory asynchrony may easily occur. In addition, Younes’ approach is

limited to a set of speciﬁc conditions: he only computed machine TI for a few selected levels of resistance, compliance, and Pmus. As a result, Younes’ study only covers a range of ␶/TI values between ϳ0.3 and 0.6. As shown in Fig. 4, this range of ␶/TI cannot reveal information about expiratory asynchrony in other common pathophysiological conditions outside of this limited range.
Potential Applications of This Study
Although the assumptions used in this study preclude the direct extrapolation of our data to clinical applications, some basic rules that the study has revealed may be clinically helpful. In patients with a long time constant of respiratory system, such as COPD patients, clinicians may need to set a high level of expiratory trigger sensitivity to achieve expiratory synchrony. When a patient is stabilized with a good expiratory synchrony at a given expiratory trigger sensitivity level and if clinicians suction the patient’s airway (i.e., reduction in the airway resistance) or increase the Pps level, for instance, clinicians should
reassure expiratory synchrony due to the change in V˙ TI/ V˙ peak. More importantly, our study may indicate the
possibility of development of a computer-automated expiratory trigger sensitivity feature in future mechanical ventilators.

APPENDIX
Validation of the Mathematical Model Using a Mechanical Lung Model
A mechanical lung model setup was used to validate the appropriateness of our mathematical model. The mechanical model (Michigan TTL, model 1600) consisted of two compartments in drive-dependent relationship (17). One side of TTL was driven by a Bear 5 ventilator using a sinusoidal ﬂow pattern. The other side of TTL was connected to a Siemens 300 ventilator through a parabolic resistor (R5 or R20). The two sides of TTL were connected completely by a metal connector, which allowed the two compartments to behave like compliances in series. The pressure at the driving compartment can therefore be taken as inspiratory Pmus when the compliance of the driving lung was set at 0.2 l/cmH2O to simulate the chest wall compliance. This mechanical model simulates the interactive relationship between a ventilator and a patient who does not exhibit active expira-

tory effort. The compliance of the dependent lung was set to

0.08, 0.04, or 0.02 l/cmH2O. The settings of the Siemens 300 were as follows: pressure support mode, pressure support of

10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of zero, pressure trigger sensitivity of Ϫ0.5 cmH2O, rise time of 1%. The Bear 5 was set at continuous mandatory ventilation with TI of 1.0 s

and frequency of 10 breaths/min. The peak ﬂow of the Bear 5

was set so that the peak ﬂow at the airway of the dependent

lung achieved 1 l/s when the Siemens 300 was not connected.

A hot wire ﬂow transducer (model RF-L, Minato Medical

Science, Osaka, Japan) and a pressure transducer (Heise

901A, Dresser Industries, Stratford, CT) were placed at the Y

connector of the Siemens 300 to measure the patient Paw and

ﬂow. The same pressure and ﬂow transducers were placed at

the Y connector of the Bear 5 to measure Pmus max and to

identify the time when the driving lung completed inspira-

tion. The signals from the transducers were digitized at 100

Hz and recorded on a computer recorder (model DT2831,

Data Translation, Marlborough, MA). The ﬂow rate at the

patient airway was measured both at its peak value (V˙ peak)

and at the time when the driving lung completed inspiration

(V˙ TI). Dividing V˙ TI by ˙Vpeak generated V˙ TI/V˙ peak values at

different levels of Pps/Pmus max and ␶/TI in the mechanical

using values values

measured from the mechanical model were compared (Table

3). The data indicate a favorable consistency between the

values from both models (r2 ϭ 0.98, P Ͻ 0.01, bias: 8% Ϯ 5%;

means Ϯ SD).

In this study, the Siemens 300 was chosen because it has a

very high pressure cycling criteria in PSV (i.e., ϩ20 cmH2O above the target Pps level) (5). Our previous study using the

same mechanical lung model (17) showed that the pressure

criteria in the Siemens 300 under the above test conditions

has never been activated, which allowed us to evaluate the

effects of only ﬂow termination criteria.
