the two, but atrial ﬂutter patients had more co-morbidities. During 5 years of follow-up, we observed 38 and 36

deaths in the atrial ﬂutter and AF groups, corresponding to an almost two-fold higher mortality rate among atrial

ﬂutter patients [crude HR 1.92, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.22 – 3.03]. The higher mortality rate persisted after

adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.05 – 2.69). The rate of

thrombo-embolic events was similar in the two groups (crude HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.71 – 2.56; adjusted HR 1.22,

Conclusion

In this observational study, patients with atrial ﬂutter had a signiﬁcantly higher all-cause mortality rate compared with

those with AF after an ablation procedure, but similar thrombo-embolic event rates. Future studies should elucidate the

reason for this difference in mortality.

Introduction
Atrial ﬂutter confers a higher mortality and thrombo-embolic risk compared with a healthy population, and this risk is considered to be similar to that seen in atrial ﬁbrillation (AF).1–5 Current guidelines6 recommend that patients with atrial ﬂutter are managed the same way as those with AF, with regard to thrombo-embolic prevention. Contrary to ablation of AF, ablation of atrial ﬂutter is often offered as a ﬁrstline treatment for typical atrial ﬂutter and due to the high procedural success rate ( 95%) and the low annual recurrence rate (5–10%);7 ablation is often considered as a curative treatment. Indeed, it has

been suggested that a cavotricuspid isthmus ablation procedure could reduce the risk of stroke and mortality in patient with atrial ﬂutter;8 however, there are only few studies that have investigated long-term mortality after an atrial ﬂutter ablation procedure.8–10
In the present study, we hypothesized that there is a similar mortality and thrombo-embolic risk following stand-alone atrial ﬂutter ablation compared with an AF ablation. To investigate this hypothesis, we used data from nationwide Danish health registries to assess and compare the long-term risk of mortality and thrombo-embolic events in patients with atrial ﬂutter compared with those with AF following an ablation procedure.

Methods
Data sources
Study data were obtained by merging three nationwide Danish health registries. Using the unique Danish personal identiﬁcation number that is assigned to all Danish residents, we linked data from the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish National Patient Registry, and the National Prescription Registry. The Danish Civil Registration System holds information on date of birth, sex, migration, vital status, and date of death of all Danish inhabitants. The National Prescription Registry has recorded data on all prescriptions dispensed from Danish pharmacies since 1994, coded according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classiﬁcation System. The Danish National Patient Registry has registered all hospital admissions along with discharge diagnoses since 1977 [using since 1994 the 10th version of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD)]. The Danish National Patient Registry also contains information on surgical procedures, coded according to the Danish version of the Nordic Classiﬁcation of Surgical Procedures.
Study population and clinical variables
The study population comprised of Danish patients, between 18 and 75 years old, registered with an incident atrial ﬂutter or AF ablation procedure code, between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2014. Baseline was deﬁned as the date that the ablation procedure was registered. To reduce confounding, patients with a previous atrial ﬂutter or an AF ablation procedure code, or ICD-10 codes for heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, pacemaker, valvular heart disease, and/or prior thrombo-embolic events were excluded from the study population. To ensure that we only included patients treated according to the guidelines for ablation procedure, we excluded those who were not warfarin users at baseline (deﬁned as not having redeemed a prescription for warfarin in a 90-day period before baseline and as sensitivity analysed with cut-off at 180 and 360 days before baseline).
Comorbid conditions were identiﬁed in the Danish National Patient Registry based on ICD-10 codes (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). The National Prescription Registry was used to obtain information on medication according to ATC codes (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause death, as obtained from The Danish Civil Registration System. Secondary outcomes were a combined endpoint of thrombo-embolic events (ischaemic stroke, ICD-10 I63; transient ischaemic attack, ICD-10, G45; pulmonary embolism, ICD-10, I26), as obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry.
Statistical analysis
Time-to-event analysis was used to describe and compare event rates in the two arrhythmia groups. Time-to-event was measured from the ablation procedure until death, combined thrombo-embolic event, emigration, or end of follow-up 1 January 2014, whichever came ﬁrst.

Kaplan – Meier curves were used to describe survival in each of the two arrhythmia groups. Event rates and hazard ratios (HRs) based on Cox proportional hazard regression models were calculated for 5 years of follow-up. HR was adjusted for baselines differences using following variables: age (continuous; cubic spline), sex (binary), hypertension (binary), and diabetes mellitus (binary). In an additional adjusted analysis, we also adjusted for time since the diagnosis of atrial ﬂutter or AF (continuous; cubic spline) and anticoagulant therapy (time-varying covariate: ,90 days since last warfarin prescription redemption).
We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding all patients with a prior diagnosis/procedure code for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous heart valve operation, heart arrhythmia operation, and/or congenital heart disease.
Data were analysed using Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).11
Ethical considerations
No ethical approval is required for anonymous registry-based studies in Denmark. The study has been approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (File No. 2012-41-0633).
Results
We identiﬁed 8170 patients with an incident atrial ﬂutter or an AF ablation procedure. A total of 4809 patients did not fulﬁl the inclusion criteria and were excluded, mainly due to the lack of anticoagulant treatment (n ¼ 2044) at baseline (Figure 1). The study population consists of 3361 patients and 1096 (33%) had an incident atrial ﬂutter ablation procedure. Baseline characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. In both arrhythmia groups, patients were predominantly male (79.2 vs. 72.6%) with similar age (mean: 59.3 vs. 57.4 years). The most common co-morbidity in both groups was hypertension (26.5 vs. 27.0%). There was a higher frequency of patients with congenital heart disease (3.3 vs. 0.8%), prior heart arrhythmia operation (2.3 vs. 1.4%), and heart valve operation (1.2 vs. 0.4%) in the atrial ﬂutter group. The use of antiarrhythmic medication was evenly distributed between the two groups. Mean time with diagnosis was lower in the atrial ﬂutter group compared with the AF group (mean: 2.0 vs. 2.8 years).
Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the two arrhythmia groups are shown in Figure 2 and indicate a higher mortality risk in the atrial ﬂutter group compared with the AF group. There was no clear difference in short-term mortality between the two arrhythmia groups.
Event rates and HR for 5-year follow-up are presented in Table 2. We observed an almost two-fold higher crude mortality rate after atrial ﬂutter ablation, when compared with AF ablation [crude HR 1.92, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.22–3.03]. This higher rate persisted after multivariable adjustment (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.05 –2.69). After additional adjustment for time with diagnosis and (timevarying) anticoagulant therapy, we found similar effect size estimates, although they were no longer statistically signiﬁcant (HR 1.50, 95% CI 0.92 – 2.45). Of note after 3 months, the proportion of patients still in anticoagulant therapy was 83% for atrial ﬂutter patients compared with 87% for the AF patients (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The rate of thrombo-embolic events was similar in the atrial ﬂutter group compared with the AF group (crude HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.71 – 2.56; adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62 – 2.41; Table 2). In a univariate analysis, only age was a predictive factor

In the sensitivity analysis excluding patients with prior heart arrhythmia operation, heart valve operation, and congenital heart disease, we still observed a higher mortality rate in the atrial ﬂutter group compared with the AF group, although this was no longer statistically signiﬁcant (crude HR 1.83; 95% CI 1.14 – 2.93)

Ablation of atrial ﬂutter compared with atrial ﬁbrillation

841

Discussion
In this large-scale study using Danish nationwide registry data, we found that patients with atrial ﬂutter had a signiﬁcantly higher allcause mortality rate compared with those with AF after an ablation procedure, but a similar or trend against a possibly modestly higher thrombo-embolic risk.
To our knowledge, there are no long-term studies investigating mortality after an atrial ﬂutter ablation procedure. However, observational studies3,4 have suggested that atrial ﬂutter confers a similar mortality risk as patients with AF in a non-ablated population and that atrial ﬂutter ablation is associated with a 45% lower all-cause

mortality risk compared with non-ablated atrial ﬂutter patients.8 Our study extends these observations by indicating a higher mortality rate after atrial ﬂutter ablation compared with AF ablation.
The overall mortality rates were quite low in both groups, with an absolute risk difference being 1.9% over a 5-year follow-up period, but this ﬁnding was very surprising to us. In this study, death occurred in 38 patients (3.5%) with atrial ﬂutter which is lower than the 18.5% reported in the study by Seara et al.10 Indeed, Seara et al. found that in patients without transition to AF after an atrial ﬂutter ablation, age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.09), chronic pulmonary disease (HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.39–5.83), and heart failure (HR 2.72, 95% CI 1.15 –6.40) were predictive factors for death. In contrast to Seara et al., we excluded patients with prior heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, prior thrombo-embolic events, and those who were non-anticoagulated at baseline. This means that our study population is a relatively healthy one compared with Seara et al. However, even after adjustment of age, we still found that the higher mortality risk persisted. As expected, the mean time with diagnosis was higher in the AF group compared with the atrial ﬂutter group (2.8 vs. 2.0 years), consistent with guideline recommendations that an atrial ﬂutter ablation procedure could be offered as a ﬁrst-line treatment. Conversely, AF ablation is usually recommended following unsuccessful treatment with an anti-arrhythmic drug. After adjustment for time with diagnosis and anticoagulant therapy during follow-up, HR of death remained comparable with those from the main analysis, although they were no longer statistically signiﬁcant.
The incidence of thrombo-embolic events was similar in the groups (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62– 2.41) and cannot explain the higher mortality rate. The stroke rate of 4.6 strokes per 1000 person-years is lower than in a study from the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center12 that reported an incidence of 21 strokes per

1000 person-years after a successful ablation procedure for typical atrial ﬂutter. All patients in the present study were on anticoagulant treatment at the time of the ablation procedure, and the higher mortality rate persisted even after adjustment for anticoagulant therapy during follow-up.
One major concern after an successful atrial ﬂutter ablation procedure is the development of incident AF, which in some studies has been reported as high as 2513 and 33.4%.10 Unfortunately, we have no information on the development of incident AF after the atrial ﬂutter ablation procedure. In contrast to our results, one population-based study4 found a similar mortality risk in patients with both atrial ﬂutter and AF compared with those with only AF (47 vs. 45%).
One plausible explanation for the differences in mortality would be that the co-morbidity among atrial ﬂutter ablation patients is of a multifactorial nature not easily captured by simple regression adjustment, as performed in our study. Indeed, our ﬁndings for baseline comorbidities suggest that atrial ﬂutter ablation patients were uniformly slightly more ill than AF ablation patients. As an alternative explanation, one could also speculate that the higher mortality rate be driven by the clinician’s perception that an atrial ﬂutter ablation procedure is more ‘curative’ than an AF ablation procedure, so that post-ablation follow-up in atrial ﬂutter patients may be insufﬁcient. Undertreated atrial tachyarrhythmias could lead to heart failure and thereby a higher mortality rate. Although there were no overwhelming differences between the atrial ﬂutter and the AF group at baseline characteristics, progressive co-morbidity, repeated ablation procedures, or pacemaker implantation could perhaps explain the higher mortality and the higher mortality rate could thus be multifactorial. Also, the development of AF post-ablation could lead to more fatal strokes in the atrial ﬂutter group.6 Future studies should elucidate the patient history following the initial ablation procedure.
Limitations
There are several important limitations to the present study. Most importantly, our study is based on registry data which leaves open the possibility of residual and unmeasured confounding, in addition to a misclassiﬁcation and ascertainment error. It is plausible that atrial ﬂutter ablation is offered to a more elderly and possibly more sick population for which the relevant co-morbidities are not captured by the registries. In particular, we had no information on time in therapeutic range among warfarin users, and the warfarin prescription criteria were based on a strict deﬁnition; nor did we have information on laboratory, anthropometric, or socioeconomic data. We also did not have information on cause of death.
Another limitation, a prior history of AF, may have been underestimated in the atrial ﬂutter ablation group, as it is sometimes asymptomatic and therefore may not have been documented. Finally, the study is performed on an ethnically and socioeconomically relatively homogeneous population. It is therefore important to reassess our ﬁndings in more diverse study populations.

Conclusion
Patients with atrial ﬂutter had a signiﬁcantly higher all-cause mortality rate compared with those with AF after an ablation procedure. Future studies are needed to better understand the reasons for this higher mortality.
