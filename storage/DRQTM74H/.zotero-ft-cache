Many people have helped me get from 1985 to 1990, both in the United States and in Catalonia. Professionally, I am de nitely the product of the very stimulating environment I enjoyed at the University of Pennsylvania. It is only with the teaching and help of George Cardona, John Fought, Jacob Hoeksema, Ann Houston, Aravind Joshi, Anthony Kroch, William Labov, Paul Lloyd, Ellen Prince, and Gillian Sanko that I have managed to understand what it is that codeswitching, grammaticalization, linguistic change, morphology, phonology, pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and variation have in common.
Ellen Prince, my dissertation supervisor, fueled my interest in pragmatics from the very beginning. Her in uence on me and my work is enormous, as attested by the contents of this dissertation, and her continued support, encouragement, and friendship has propelled me through graduate school. I was very fortunate to have her as my advisor. Jacob Hoeksema, committee member, made me realize that you cannot do pragmatics without knowing some semantics. His promptness in providing comments and suggestions on my work, from even before I started my dissertation, was of great value to me and an important part of this dissertation deals with issues he brought to my attention. Anthony Kroch's thinking and instruction has had a tremendous impact on me as well. As a member of my dissertation committee he has always played a crucial role in determining the way I addressed both the global and the particular issues. Without his ability to get me out of several cul-de-sacs this dissertation would not be nished yet. Despite my undeniable indebtedness to my committee members, any errors or shortcomings of this work are my sole responsibility.
Equally important has been the help and in uence of my fellow graduate students at Penn, from whom I learned almost as much as I learned from my teachers, mostly through informal, semiformal, and formal seminars, hallway chats, and discussions during truck lunches. A partial list would include Cathy Ball, Sharon Cote, Josep M. Fontana, Bob Frank, Ruth Herold, Caroline Heycock, Beth Ann Hockey, Shizhi Huang, Young-Suk Lee, Claudia Mazzie, Megan Moser, Peter Patrick, Robin Sabino, Beatrice Santorini, Ann Taylor, Brian Teaman, Tom Veatch, and Ra aella Zanuttini. Their contribution to my work in general and this dissertation in par-
iii

ticular has been extremely valuable. Another thing I learned from these and other friends at Penn, with whom I have had good fun, is that one can be a serious linguists and not talk about linguistics all the time, which was a relief.
My doctorate and, therefore, this dissertation, became a reality thanks to the nancial support of la Caixa during two years of Fulbright/la Caixa fellowship and thanks to the assistantship, graduate fellowship, and Mellon dissertation fellowship granted to me by the Department of Linguistics and the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania during my last three years. I also want to thank the Department of Computer and Information Sciences and the Cognitive Science Group for excellent computational resources.
The best part of it, though, is that many of the people mentioned above are not only excellent teachers and colleagues but also very dear friends, a fact that made life much easier. However, I am lucky to have very good nonlinguist friends as well, who have always encouraged me and made my work more pleasurable. There are the members of the everchanging West Philadelphia Catalan settlement, with whom I was always able to share Catalan food and humor. There is my mother Maria Rosa, my sister Milos, and my brother Gerard, who allowed me to stay far away from them in a time when I should have not. There are my friends in Catalonia, with whom I have managed to maintain a strong relationship, despite the episodic nature of our encounters. And nally there is my American English native informant of four years, Joan, who made me feel at home wherever we were together and, to top it o , proofread this dissertation as well.
Finally, I must acknowledge my deep indebtedness to my grandfather Ramon, from whom I learned more than he can imagine, even though I never thought that his idea that I become an expert welding engineer was particularly brilliant. Oh, well : : :

ABSTRACT The Informational Component
Enric Vallduv Supervisor: Ellen F. Prince
Even though the relevance of non-truth-conditional notions like `topic' and `focus' in sentence structure and interpretation has long been recognized, there is little agreement on the exact nature of these notions and their role in a model of linguistic competence. Following the information-packaging approach (Chafe 1976, Prince 1986), this study argues that these notions are primitive elements in the informational component of language. This component, informatics, is responsible for the articulation of sentences qua information, where information is de ned as that part of propositional content which constitutes a contribution of knowledge to the hearer's knowledge-store. Informational primitives combine into four possible distinct information-packaging instructions, which direct hearers to retrieve the information of a sentence and enter it into their knowledge-store in a speci c way.
After a discussion of previous approaches to the informational articulation of the sentence, a hierarchical articulation is proposed: sentences are divided into the focus, which is the only information of the sentence, and the ground, which speci es how that information ts in the hearer's knowledge-store. The ground is further divided into the link, which denotes an address in the hearer's knowledge-store under which s/he is instructed to enter the information, and the tail, which provides further directions on how the information must be entered under a given address.
Empirical support for this representation of information packaging comes especially from the surface encoding of instructions in Catalan, which is then contrasted with that of English. Using a multistratal syntactic theory, it is then proposed that information packaging is structurally and purely represented at the abstract level of IS, which acts as an interface with informatics. Finally, in order to further argue for informatics as an autonomous linguistic component, some proposals that attempt to include informational notions under logical semantics are reviewed and countered.
This study is an e ort to gain insight into one subdomain of pragmatics by integrating it into the larger process of language understanding. This is done by giving otherwise elusive informational notions a speci c role in the component responsible for the entry of information into the hearer's knowledge-store.

Introduction
1.1 Goals
One of the major goals of linguistics is to explain how meaning is encoded in linguistic structure. Linguists try to understand and describe the process by which the human mind takes a string of acoustic signals, interprets it, and turns it into a conceptual structure. Indeed, we have gained a fair amount of understanding about our linguistic competence. It is generally agreed that the physical reality of an utterance's phonetic shape is mapped onto an abstract phonological representation where bundles of acoustic parameters are converted into bundles of distinctive phonological features with inherent linguistic value. On the basis of this phonological representation, in turn, we are capable of capturing the syntactic structure of a sentence, and once this syntactic object is available, we proceed to its interpretation.
But what does interpretation consist of? Traditionally, linguists have considered that meaning is abstractly represented in the semantic component of language. Interpretation, then, can be viewed as a translation from syntactic objects into semantic objects or propositions, which will in turn be converted into more general nonlinguistic conceptual structures in the mental knowledge store. We have relied on truth-conditional logic to provide us with a way to formally represent meaning, and, since Richard Montague, in the late 1960s, we can also compositionally translate syntactic objects into semantic formulae with extreme systematicity.
Truth-conditional semantics, however, while yielding important results, cannot account for the entire range of phenomena we would normally include under the label of meaning. In order to bene t fully from truth-conditional semantics, we need an
1

additional sort of meaning interpretation beyond, or along with, truth-conditional interpretation. In fact, and due mostly to the in uence of Paul Grice in his 1967 W. James lectures, such an assumption underlies much work in modern linguistics, hence the methodological division of labor between the study of semantics and the study of pragmatics.
The object of study of this dissertation lies outside the realm of truth-conditional semantics and within the realm of pragmatics. The kind of non-truth-conditional meaning we shall be concerned with is information packaging or, equivalently, informational meaning.1 Even though information packaging is traditionally regarded as just one subtype of pragmatic understanding, it is su ciently distinct and self-contained to warrant our studying it without considering other types of pragmatic phenomena. Such an approach has led to the identi cation of two important primitives in the study of information packaging, the familiar notions of focus and topic.
What sort of `meaning' is information packaging? It has long been noted by linguists that di erent sentential forms can express the same propositional content, or, inversely, that one and the same semantic proposition can be expressed by a variety of constructions. For instance, (1)a and (1)b,
(1) a. He hates broccoli. b. Broccoli he hates.
are truth-conditionally equivalent, i.e., the same conditions that must be met for (a) to be true must be met for (b) to be true. The di erence between (a) and (b), therefore, is not in what they say about the world, but in how they say what they say about the world. This non-truth-conditional di erence in sentence understanding that we observe in (1) is a di erence in information packaging. In other words, (a) and (b) are equivalent logico-semantically but not informationally: while their propositional contents are the same, they do not provide the same information, where two sentences with the same propositional content may convey di erent information in di erent speaker-hearer interactions depending on how and how much
1As a norm, the term `information packaging' will be used, but `informational meaning' comes in handy especially when information packaging is contrasted with logico-semantic meaning and when emphasizing the importance of information within the global process of interpretation (or `meaning' in the wide sense of the word).
2

this propositional content contributes to the hearer's knowledge-store at the time of utterance.
Indeed, speakers seem to structure or package the information conveyed by a sentence at a given time-point (cf. Chafe 1976, Prince 1986) according to their assumptions about their interlocutors' beliefs or knowledge and attentional state. Hearers' knowledge and attentional state, due to the mere e ect of the discourse input, change continually in a given linguistic encounter and, therefore, so changes the way in which speakers package information. With this packaging speakers seem to instruct hearers to retrieve the information carried by a sentence and enter it into their knowledge-store in a particular way. Each one of this particular ways to package information will be referred to as an instruction. Di erent packaging structures license di erent sentential con gurations like the ones in (1).
In this sense, then, information packaging is a very context-sensitive component of language understanding, springing from each particular speaker-hearer interaction and, furthermore, re ecting the changes in (the speaker's beliefs about) the knowledge and attentional state of the hearer that take place during this interaction. Truth-conditionally equivalent sentences encoded in di erent information-packaging instructions are, therefore, not mutually interchangeable in a given context of utterance, preserving felicity. It is this context-sensitivity that has traditionally placed information packaging within the scope of pragmatic inquiry.
Example (1) showed that the same logico-semantic proposition may be encoded in di erent packaging structures. The opposite is also true the same packaging instruction may be used to encode di erent logico-semantic propositions. In a sentence like (2),
(2) Broccoli he loves.
there is a certain interpretive equivalence with (1)b, having to do with the linear order of phrases2, which is absent from (1)a. Sentences (1)b and (2), while truth-conditionally distinct, may be said to represent the same packaging instruction, i.e. their informational structure is identical. In these sentences there are two overlapping elements that are simultaneously expressed in the sentence structure: logico-semantic propositional content and information-packaging instructions. A
2The syntactic con guration in (1)b and (2) is traditionally referred to as `topicalization'.
3

complete linguistic theory, of course, must ultimately explain what these elements are, describe their representation, and study their interaction.
One way in which the issue may be addressed is by viewing logico-semantic meaning and information packaging as belonging to two separate independent components of language. Although both components are interpretive in some sense, the sort of `meaning' each component deals with is of a di erent nature. This is, in fact, the thesis of this dissertation: that a complete model of linguistic competence must include a component, which I will call informatics, that is merely concerned with the interpretation and generation of information packaging. Even though informatics is an autonomous component, one expects there to be much indirect interaction between it and other components of language, e.g. syntax, semantics, and phonology. Interaction with syntax and phonology is the necessary result of having to express information packaging through the structural components of language. Interaction with logical semantics is the unavoidable consequence of a close coexistence within the interpretive end of language.
Despite abundant research in the area, the exact nature of informational notions remains evasive and controversial. This study shows that, by adopting a strict literal interpretation of the notion packaging, originally Chafe's (1976), a more explicit de nition of information packaging and a clearer idea of what its niche is within the larger linguistic apparatus can be o ered. Our theory, which builds upon previous research in the area3, includes an informational ontology with four basic
primitive notions arranged in a hierarchical articulation S=ffocus, groundg and f ground= link, tailg, the combinatorial rules by means of which the di erent
packaging instructions are obtained, and the interpretive rules by means of which such packaging instructions are interpreted.
The mere availability of a coherent and comprehensive theory of informatics indirectly validates the tacit assumption that informatics is a well-de ned, autonomous component. Nevertheless, other approaches may be taken |and have been taken| to attain the incorporation of informational meaning into a theory of language competence. One may try to account for the facts discussed around (1) and (2)
3Most notably, in this particular respect, in the work of Bolinger 1954, Kuno 1972, Dahl 1974, Gundel 1974, 1988, Chafe 1976, Prince 1981a, 1986, Reinhart 1982, Ward 1985, Lambrecht 1987, and Valimaa-Blum 1988, among others.

di erently, for instance, by saying that all di erences observed between the three sentences in question are all of the same kind. In fact, it has been argued that the di erence between sentences like (1)a and (1)b is indeed truth-conditional (see Szabolcsi 1981 and Svoboda & Materna 1987 for analyses along these lines). Some plausibility for this claim comes from the fact that some informational notions seem to have truth-conditional e ects, especially with sentential operators like negation, the yes/no interrogative operator, and exhaustiveness (cf. Jackendo 1972, Horn 1981, Rooth 1985).
In order to show that informatics is indeed a distinct, autonomous part of linguistic interpretation, this study discusses some of these truth-conditional e ects and o ers alternative analyses that account for the data without requiring direct interaction between logico-semantic operators and informational elements. It is shown that sometimes the putative interaction is merely a pragmatically induced mirage| in the case of exhaustiveness|and that at other times|in the case of negation and interrogation|it is the result of the indirect interaction between parallel but autonomous components.
Our theory emphasizes the autonomy of informatics not only with respect to truth-conditional logico-semantic meaning but also with respect to other types of non-truth-conditional interpretation. It is fair to say that we now know that BarHillel's (1971) `pragmatic wastebasket' is not just one basket but a cover term that encompasses various distinct phenomena of a very di erent nature. While phonology, syntax, and semantics refer to both a linguistic area of inquiry and a component in a model of linguistic competence, pragmatics has only a methodological connotation.
By providing a rigorous theory of informatics, we want to contribute to the enterprise of hooking up `pragmatic competence' to the larger linguistic apparatus, following Prince 1988a. To do so one needs to identify the `real' linguistic components currently encompassed under the overarching label of pragmatics and nd their place in the model. This study must be considered, then, a move towards improving our understanding of some pragmatic phenomena in language and their relationship with other types of linguistic evidence: if it is possible to come up with a sound theory of informatics, another fragment of the reputedly `messy' pragmatic mosaic will have become clearer.

Informational understanding and the packaging instructions that encode it must obviously be recoverable from the overt structure of any language. Information packaging is structurally represented by syntactic, morphological, or prosodic means, or a combination of these, as is usually the case. It is well known that in English information packaging may be expressed exclusively by means of prosody (cf. e.g. Selkirk 1984, Rochemont 1986). Compare, for instance, (3)a to (3)b, where small caps signal the constituent containing prosodic prominence:
(3) a. The boss hates broccoli. b. The boss hates broccoli.
Sentences (3)a and (3)b are logico-semantically equivalent, the truth-conditions that must be met for them to be true are exactly the same. Still, the understandings we obtain from them, their `meanings' in a wide sense of the term, are di erent in some respect. As in the case of (1) above, the di erence between (a) and (b) is a di erence in information packaging. These sentences embody two di erent informational structures that represent two di erent packaging instructions, let us call them x and y, with nevertheless the same propositional content.
Not all languages, however, represent instructions x and y as English does. In fact, there is considerable crosslinguistic variation in this respect. Catalan, for example, does not allow the equivalent of (3)b. In Catalan, prosody alone is not enough to represent information packaging it must be accompanied by a syntactic operation (cf. Vallduv 1988a). The Catalan equivalent to the contrastive pair in (3), representing instructions x and y, respectively, is shown in (4):
(4) a. L'amo odia el broquil. the.boss 3s-hate the broccoli `The boss hates broccoli.'
b. L'amo l1' odia t1, el broquil1. the.boss obj-cl 3s-hate the broccoli `The boss hates broccoli.'
We notice the similar prosodic pattern between (3) and (4), but also that (4)b has undergone a syntactic operation absent in (4)a, a rightward detachment of el broquil `broccoli', the syntactic evidence for which is the object clitic (l1) that must be coindexed with an empty argument position (t1) (cf. Borer 1981, inter alia). In
6

other words, di erent languages choose di erent structural means to spell out the same packaging instruction.
In order to gain insight into the exact nature of the syntax-informatics interface, this study o ers a detailed analysis of the syntax of information packaging in Catalan. Catalan, as just mentioned, requires overt syntactic operations where English requires only prosodic marking. By contrasting English and Catalan in this respect some crosslinguistically valid generalizations regarding the mapping between syntax and informatics may be attained.
While syntactic theory has long dealt with issues concerning the structural representation of theta relations, case requirements or logico-semantic structures, the representation of informational structure has been generally neglected.4 Even most of the work done in the functionalist tradition, where informational relationships are the central concern, seems to view them as basically asyntactic, that is, untreatable in terms of a traditional syntactic analysis.5 This study takes the position that information packaging, while part of an autonomous interpretive component, is just another type of abstract structure that has to be represented at the surface. In other words, the lexical item everybody, for instance, in a given sentence, must be interpreted not only as a quanti er over a proposition and as an argument of a predicate, but also as having a particular standing in a packaging instruction. All of these things must be recoverable from the surface shape of a sentence and it is the job of a theory of syntax to explain how. This study, using one of the most widely-accepted theories of syntax, the Principles & Parameters Theory (cf. Chomsky 1981, 1986 and subsequent work by his associates), suggests how this might be done.

of informatics within the wider eld of pragmatics and its task within the model of linguistic competence. The issue of what pragmatics is and what the eld covers as an area of inquiry is brie y surveyed and then we consider di erent phenomena that belong to linguistic pragmatics, both at the level of the sentence and at the level of the discourse. Also in this chapter, information packaging is examined and de ned. The goal of this chapter is to clarify the relationship between information packaging and other pragmatic but distinct phenomena and, at the same time, ascertain the role of information packaging within the complex process of language production and comprehension.
Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive critical survey of the previous literature on information packaging, from the early Prague School proposals to the current so-called `generative' functions-of-syntax analyses. We concentrate on two of the approaches, namely the `focus-presupposition' approach and the `topic-comment' approach, pointing out the advantages and the shortcomings of the binomial informational articulations they put forward. Finally, we present a trinomial hierarchical articulation of the sentence based on the insights gained from the survey of the previous approaches.
In Chapter 4, building upon the trinomial hierarchical articulation and following the notion of information packaging literally, we provide a coherent notation for the representation of information packaging and propose a small nite inventory of packaging instructions, i.e. speakers' instructions on how hearers must retrieve the information carried by the sentence and enter it into their knowledge-store, stated in procedural terms. This instructions are obtained from the arrangement of the informational primitives in a given sentence in a compositional way.
Chapter 5 studies in detail the surface manifestation of information packaging in one language: Catalan. Catalan surface syntax presents a straightforward encoding of information packaging which provides empirical support for the representation of informatics proposed in the previous chapter. The chapter includes a brief introduction to Catalan syntax, a discussion of the syntax of information packaging, and a comparison between Catalan and English.
Chapter 6 focuses on the nature of the syntax-informatics interface. As mentioned above, the interpretation of information packaging must be guaranteed by an appropriate and unambiguous representation in the structural component of lan-
8

guage. Within the multistratal framework of the Principles & Parameters Theory, we suggest how information packaging can be connected to the syntax. It is proposed that an abstract level of representation|Information Structure|mediates the mapping between informatics and the surface syntactic con guration of sentences, in the same way the level of LF mediates between semantic interpretation and surface syntactic structure, thus o ering a pure structural representation of information packaging. The proposal involves a discussion of the con guration of Information Structure, the operations that map it to S-structure, and its independence from LF.
In Chapter 7 we return to the assumption that informatics and semantics are two distinct interpretive components in our linguistic competence. This assumption is not universally shared and analyses are found in the literature than argue or tacitly assume that certain informational notions have truth-conditional e ects. This chapter contains counteranalyses of these putative truth-conditional e ects. In particular, we concentrate on the interaction between focus and negative and interrogative sentences and the apparent dependence of exhaustiveness operators like only on focus. Alternatives are provided that show that the truth-conditional e ects are in fact the result of indirect interaction between the semantic and informational components, thus avoiding the use of informational notions in a logico-semantic representation.
Finally, in Chapter 8 we conclude by evaluating the ndings and proposals presented in this dissertation. These remarks are centered around the advantages of our proposal, the place of informatics within the larger linguistic apparatus, and its relevance within the general context of meaning and interpretation and in the mapping between the structural and the interpretive components of language.

Chapter 2
Pragmatics and Informatics
2.1 Scope of Pragmatics
As pointed out in the introductory chapter, this dissertation is meant as a contribution to our understanding of certain pragmatic phenomena in language. The scope of pragmatic inquiry, however, is extremely wide, and, moreover, di erent scholarly traditions have di erent ideas about what this scope is. For instance, within the Continental European tradition pragmatics includes the study of issues more commonly studied within applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, ethnolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and the sociology of language.6 The term pragmatics is used here as in the Anglo-American linguistic and philosophic tradition. Following Levinson (1983), pragmatics is understood as being `the study of those relations between language and context that are grammaticalized, or encoded in the structure of language' (1983:9).
Unfortunately, even after leaving social and applied pragmatics aside and concentrating on linguistic pragmatics, we still must deal with the very confusing array of phenomena that Bar-Hillel (1971) called the `pragmatic wastebasket'. In fact, the term pragmatics in current linguistic theory di ers from its sister terms syntax and semantics in a crucial way. Both syntax and semantics refer to a methodological area of inquiry within linguistics, but simultaneously they also refer to a coherent and distinct part of our cognitive linguistic apparatus. Pragmatics, in contrast, while used indeed to refer to an area of linguistic inquiry, lacks its other meaning as
6See Levinson 1983 (Ch. 1) for a thorough discussion of the origins and use of the term `pragmatics' in the di erent traditions and the scope of pragmatics as an area of inquiry.

a single coherent component of linguistic competence. There exist, of course, works that argue convincingly that human linguistic abil-
ities must include a pragmatic competence of sorts (e.g. Prince 1988a). But, even accepting the reality of pragmatic competence, one serious question remains: What kind of competence is a competence that includes knowledge of such diverse phenomena as illocution, discourse structure, reference resolution, implicature, empathy, and information packaging? It seems clear that we are not dealing with a single component of our linguistic apparatus. It makes no sense to presume that, let us say, the cognitive process responsible for illocutionary meaning interpretation is also responsible for processing the segmentation of discourse chunks. There is no empirical or conceptual support for such a presumption, beyond the fact that both types of structural phenomena involve contextual e ects of some sort.7
The `wastebasketness' of pragmatics is an artifact of our methodological division of labor. Lumping together all elements of linguistic structure that involve contextual notions (Levinson 1983) or, similarly, all aspects of meaning that have no truth-conditional e ects (Gazdar 1979) has been very useful in advancing our understanding of the nonpragmatic phenomena of language. The result of such a methodological approach, however, has been the enormous heterogeneity of pragmatics as an area of inquiry. Undoubtably, if we want to gain insight into the pragmatic end of language, plausible subdomains of inquiry must be teased apart and their role in the linguistic system and its relationship with other better-known areas of linguistic competence must be studied. This is precisely what this study attempts to do with respect to one such domain of inquiry: information packaging.
In what follows the pragmatic subdomain of information packaging will be introduced and de ned. Also, it will be useful to give an overview of some of the di erent domains of inquiry within current pragmatics, brie y outlining their object of study and their relationship to information packaging.
7Ward 1985:1, taking a pro-pragmatic-competence stance, also expresses his doubts about `a unitary pragmatic competence' and states that `as research in pragmatics develops, it will become increasingly possible to identify and classify the various types of extra-semantic contributions to utterance interpretation'.

2.2 Information Packaging
It has long been noticed that there are syntactic operations which are not triggered by the need to satisfy any known `purely' structural requirements|like the Case lter, agreement, or thematic structure|, and which are logico-semantically vacuous as well. These operations include topicalization, VP-preposing, left-dislocation, right-dislocation, adverb-preposing, gapping, it-clefting, pseudo-clefting, heavy NPshift, and probably many others. A large number of studies, within the `functions of syntax' approach, have pursued the task of establishing a raison d'^etre for all these `non-structurally-motivated' syntactic operations. This raison d'^etre is generally called the `functional load' of a sentence. In fact, some of these studies claim to have found functional loads for the existence of core syntactic operations like passive, NP-raising, tough-movement, relativization, and so on. Among the many valuable examples of this kind of work are Bolinger 1954, 1972, Hatcher 1956, Firbas 1964, Halliday 1967, Kuno 1972, 1987, Gundel 1974, 1985, Creider 1979, Wilson & Sperber 1979, Green 1980, Prince 1978, 1986, Givon 1983, Silva-Corvalan 1983, Ward 1985, Lambrecht 1987, 1988, and Valimaa-Blum 1988, even though the list could evidently be much longer.8
Following many of these works (e.g. Halliday 1967, Chafe 1976, Prince 1981a, 1984, 1986, Ward 1985, Valimaa-Blum 1988), functional load may be viewed as a packaging or structuring of the information contained in sentential structures. This packaging re ects the speaker's beliefs about how this information ts the hearer's knowledge-store. The term information packaging is used in this study to denote this nonsyntactic non-logico-semantic structuring of sentences. Information packaging can be thought to be part of the `meaning' of sentences, if `meaning' is understood in a generous way as encompassing several distinct types of interpretation necessary in achieving full understanding of sentences. In other words, the successful interpretation of sentences requires not only the interpretation of logicosemantic meaning|generally referred to as just meaning in its narrow sense|but
8Within a di erent linguistic tradition, there are a number of works that have looked at these `functionally-motivated' constructions from a purely syntactic point of view: Akmajian 1979(1970), Chomsky 1971, 1976, Gueron 1980, Kiss 1981, Williams 1981, Huang 1982, Culicover & Rochemont 1983, Selkirk 1984 (these two last works deal with the phonological interface as well), Solan 1984, Horvath 1986, Rochemont 1986, 1989, inter alia.
12

also, at least, the interpretation of informational meaning. The notion of information packaging was explicitly introduced by Chafe 1976:
I have been using the term packaging to refer to the kind of phenomena at issue here, with the idea that they have to do primarily with how the message is sent and only secondarily with the message itself, just as the packaging of toothpaste can a ect sales in partial independence of the quality of the toothpaste inside (1976:28).
Prince (1981a, 1986, among others) picks up Chafe's packaging idea and states that speakers `tailor sentences in various ways to (their assumptions about) their interlocutors' (1988:1) or, in more detail:
Information in a discourse does not correspond simply to an unstructured set of propositions rather, speakers seem to form their utterances so as to structure the information they are attempting to convey, usually or perhaps always in accordance with their beliefs about the hearer: what s/he is thought to know, what s/he is expected to be thinking about. (1986:208)
Our use of the rubric `information packaging', however, di ers in some respects from Chafe's and Prince's. Chafe 1976 uses the term in a generally vague way. It comprises not only the notions dealt with here, but also other re exes of the speaker's attitude towards the event reported in the sentence, i.e. empathy, contrast, and a notion of `subjecthood'. Empathy is totally di erent from information packaging as understood here. Hopefully this will become clear in the following discussion. Contrast, following Prince 1984, is most likely a derived notion and not a primitive.
This issue will be addressed below in x 4.3.2. As for Chafe's subjecthood, it will not
be dealt with at all here. The term information packaging as used by Prince has a wider coverage as
well (cf. Prince 1988c, for instance). Information packaging is used to designate both the formal marking of sentences to indicate the speaker's beliefs about the hearer's knowledge and attentional state|information packaging (her informationstructure)|and the formal marking of NPs to indicate the status of discourse entities with respect to the discourse model|referential status (her information-status).
13

Prince, however, is careful to point out that `the two levels are mutually independent, though statistical relationships may exist between them' (1988c:1).
We have thus taken the term `information packaging' and reduced its coverage to only one of the two `levels' in Prince 1988c, namely her `information-structure'. The reason is twofold rst, the term `information structure' is used with a di erent meaning in Chapter 6, and information packaging seems actually a better designator of the phenomenon we are trying to account for second, in agreement with ValimaaBlum 1988, it seems that the use of the term `information' for both NP-level and sentence-level phenomena is potentially misleading, especially when the phenomena
to be distinguished are so closely related (cf. x 2.3.2 for discussion).
Our conception of information packaging is a literal interpretation of the notion of `packaging'. Namely, information packaging|the structuring or packaging of information|is taken to consist of a small set of instructions with which a speaker directs a hearer to retrieve the information encoded in a sentence and enter it into her/his knowledge-store. The purpose of information packaging is precisely to optimize the entry of data into the hearer's knowledge-store.
Before moving on, the use of the term information in this study needs some clari cation. Information, quoting Dretske 1981, `is that commodity capable of yielding knowledge, and what information a signal carries is what we can learn from it' (1981:44). Dretske's view of information, taken from the notion of information in information theory, will be adapted for our purposes: two sentences with the same propositional content may carry di erent information in di erent speaker-hearer interactions depending on how much of that propositional content is unknown by the hearer at the time of utterance. Let us illustrate this with the following example. Suppose a speaker has the knowledge represented by the proposition in (5) and wishes to communicate it.
(5) hates (broccoli, the boss)
The speaker will encode this proposition in a sentence and will utter it so that the hearer may incorporate this knowledge into her/his knowledge-store. Suppose further that the speaker, in separate occasions, communicates the proposition in (5) to two di erent hearers: a) to a hearer H1, who at the time of utterance knows nothing about or is not attending to the boss' relation to broccoli, and b) to a
14

hearer H2, who at the time of utterance knows that there exists a relation between the boss and broccoli (and is attending to it) without knowing what the relation is. A sentence encoding proposition (5) will carry di erent information in the case of H2 than in the case of H1. In H1's situation, the information of the sentence is, given the salient existence of the boss, that he hates broccoli. In H2's situation, the information of the sentence is, given a salient relation between the boss and broccoli, that this relation is `hate'. The contribution of knowledge to the hearer's knowledge-store made by (5) is smaller in the case of H2, despite the fact that the proposition is the same in both situations.
Information, as viewed in information theory, is by de nition a reduction of uncertainty: the information carried by two sentences with equal propositional content is di erent when the reduction of uncertainty they bring along to the hearer's knowledge-store is di erent. The incorporation of the proposition in (5) into the hearer's knowledge-store represents a greater reduction of uncertainty in the case of H1 than in the case of H2. H2's uncertainty is reduced by (5) only with respect to the exact relation that holds between the boss and broccoli, since, before the time of utterance, H2 knew that a relation between the two entities in question existed. In contrast, H1 was uncertain not only about the relation that holds between the boss and broccoli but also about the actual existence of a relation at all.9
The information of the sentence (Is) is, then, the part of the propositional content (ps) that makes a contribution of knowledge to the hearer's knowledge-store, i.e. that is not part of the knowledge of the hearer (Kh) at the time of utterance (or, in information-theoretic terms, the part of the propositional content that reduces uncertainty in the hearer's knowledge-store). This may be schematically represented as in (6):
(6) Is = ps ; Kh
If the entire propositional content makes a contribution of knowledge to the hearer's knowledge store, the information of the sentence is equivalent to the propositional content:
9See Pierce: `The more we know about what message the source will produce, the less uncertainty, the less the entropy, and the less the information' (1961:23).
15

'$

(7)

&% p Kh

If the propositional content makes no contribution to the hearer's knowledge-store, the information of the sentence is null:10

'$

(8)
Is = ps ; Kh =

&% p Kh

Finally, if some of the propositional content of a sentence makes a contribution of information to the hearer's knowledge-store, the information of the sentence coincides only with a subset of the knowledge encoded in that proposition:

'$

(9)

&% p Kh

; Is = ps Kh = n, where ps < n <

Information, then, unlike propositional content, is crucially de ned with respect to the particular hearer a sentence is addressed to. As noted, the information carried by a sentence encoding the proposition in (5) is, roughly, `hates broccoli' for H1, but `hates' for H2. Speakers are sensitive to these di erences in the hearer's knowledgestore and thus encode information in the structure of the sentences they produce. This encoding of information is `information packaging'. A speaker of English, for

10In Ch. 3 it is pointed out that sentences with zero information do not occur. In other words, if (the speaker assumes) there is no contribution of knowledge there is no reason for the sentence to exist.

16

instance, when wishing to communicate (5), might do so with sentence (10)a in case (a) (to hearer H1) but with sentence (10)b in case (b) (to hearer H2):11
(10) a. The boss hates broccoli. b. The boss hates broccoli.
This adaptation of Dretske's notion of information is in agreement with Dahl 1976 and Lyons 1977:33, who characterize information as a hearer-based contribution to sentence production and understanding. In fact, this notion of information has several precedents in the literature. The notions progression and marche parallele in Weil 1844 and Gabelentz's (1868) psychological articulation of the sentence seem to be analogous to the articulation of information. The notion of communicative dynamism (Danes 1968(1957), Firbas 1964, 1971) is also similar in that it suggests that di erent sentence elements `contribute to the development of communication', `push the communication forward' to di erent extents (Firbas 1964:270), i.e. some elements are more communicative than others. If `contribution of knowledge', i.e. information, is substituted for `contribution to the development of communication' in the above quote, communicativeness can be equated to information.12
Another notion that seems analogous to the view of information in this study is Erteschik-Shir's (1973, 1979, 1986) dominance. Dominance, which is reviewed
below in x 3.1.5, is a property that a constituent has if the speaker intends to direct
the attention of his/her hearer to the intension of that constituent (cf. ErteschikShir & Lappin 1983:420). There is no further speci cation of what `directing the attention of the hearer to something' is, but, in a sense, one may say that the constituent that encodes the information in the sentence is `dominant' in that it is singled out by the packaging instruction. The hearer's attention, in some way, is directed to that constituent as the carrier of the information of the sentence. Finally, there is Sasse's (1987) `expectation', which he uses to rede ne the thetic/categorical
distinction of Brentano and Marty (cf. x 3.2.3). What has been called information
here is identi ed by Sasse as unexpected or contrary to expectation. The connection
11Of course, here and in the above discussions, what matters is the speaker's assumptions about the hearer's knowledge and attentional state, not the hearer's actual knowledge and attentional state.
12In fact, as will be seen below, Firbas' rheme is equivalent to the focus of information in our proposal. Communicative dynamism, however, is a continuum, but informationand its complement in the sentence are discrete notions.
17

between the notions of information and unexpectedness is clear.13 Sentences, then, are packaged in di erent ways according to the di erent infor-
mation carried by the sentence. But, as pointed out, they must also guarantee that that information is retrievable. In other words, the informational articulation of the sentence indicates not only the information but also how this information must be entered into the hearer's knowledge-store. In fact, as will be discussed in Ch. 4, the role played by information and its packaging in language understanding concerns the entry of data into the hearer's knowledge-store. Therefore, a sentence must specify how and where in the hearer's knowledge-store the information of the sentence is entered. A compact de nition of information packaging may be stated as in (11):

(11)

information packaging: A small set of instructions with

which the hearer is instructed by the speaker to retrieve

the information carried by the sentence and enter it into

her/his knowledge-store.

Chapters 3 and 4 contain a discussion of the informational primitives proposed in the literature, a proposal for a revised set of primitives, and the development of an account of information packaging following the de nition in (11). In order to develop this account a number of notational decisions had to be made. It is clear that other alternatives may be possible or even superior to describe the facts under discussion with accuracy. Unlike in other research (i.e. standard syntactic or semantic theory), in this study there will not be a strong defense of some of the notational choices made. The study of the representation of information packaging is at too early a stage to be able to perceive the advantages or disadvantages of di erent notational variants with detail. Before going into this, however, other types of pragmatic understanding will be reviewed.

13Apparently, the rst time the term `information' was used to refer to issues we are dealing with is in Halliday's (1967) `information structure'. It must also be noted that information is used in the philosophical and linguistic literature with di erent meanings. For instance, information in Situation Semantics is used in a general and nonlinguistic sense. The information conveyed by a (linguistic or nonlinguistic) event is what we learn about a situation from that event. Information is prior to language and the purpose of language is to convey information (Barwise & Perry 1983:29 .). Our use of information, although originating in the same tradition, has a smaller coverage, since it was de ned as that part of the knowledge represented in a given proposition that is unknown to the hearer. Information in Situation Semantics is also the knowledge we gain by means of a sentence, but it is not restricted to the proposition encoded in that sentence (e.g. the sentence The boss is short, in a context where the hearer believes short men do not like broccoli, conveys the information, in the Situation Semantics sense, that the boss does not like broccoli).

2.3 Discourse Pragmatics
The de nition of pragmatics as the study of the aspects of linguistic structure affected by context presupposes a previously agreed-upon de nition of `context'. By `context', in theory, one refers to extralinguistic elements|like the users of language and the time and place of utterance|that are relevant for language production and understanding. Interestingly, though, due to the prevalent methodological practice of focusing on the study of sentential grammar, the term `context' is also used to refer to anything beyond the sentential level. Thus, discourse, understood as a cohesive sequence of sentences, while in principle as purely linguistic as a sentential syntactic object, is referred to as `linguistic context' or `discourse context'. Notice, however, that the extralinguistic context may a ect both sentential structure and discourse structure.
First, we will consider pragmatic phenomena that concern the linguistic or discourse context and, second, we will look at `sentential pragmatics', i.e. nonlinguistic contextual phenomena that a ect the structure of the sentence regardless of linguistic context.
2.3.1 Discourse Structure
As Chomsky 1980 points out, `linguistic knowledge, of course, extends beyond the level of the sentence. We know how to construct discourses of various sorts, and there are no doubt principles governing discourse structure' (1980:225). Precisely, through the study of discourse structure|a.k.a. discourse syntax, discourse grammar|linguists try to ascertain what are the principles that underlie the wellformedness of discourses or texts and which is the appropriate way to organize discourses into constituent units.14
Among the important contributions in this area are Grosz & Sidner 1986, Polanyi 1986, 1988, and Webber 1988. These works independently propose similar ways in which discourses can be segmented into hierachical constituent structures. The result is a tree-like representation where constituency re ects the chunking of the discourse into sequences of related units. What gives these chunks their unity is their
14Discourse structure is not related in any direct way to information packaging. Its inclusion here is meant to provide a complete picture of discourse pragmatics.
19

sharing a common purpose with respect to the speaker's plans (Grosz & Sidner 1986) or their representing a single state of a airs (Polanyi 1988).15
A theory of discourse segmentation is necessary to account for textual coherence and the non-permutability of sentences in a given discourse and the intuition that sentences group together in suprasentential units. It has also been shown that some discourse particles or cue phrases|well, anyway, ok|are used to signal the beginning and end of discourse segments (Hockey 1989, Polanyi & Martin 1989). Webber 1988 provides a formal treatment of `discourse deixis', i.e. reference to a discourse segment, as illustrated by the that in (12),

(12)

It's always been presumed that when the glaciers receded, the area

got very hot. The Folsum men couldn't adapt, and they died out.

That's what is supposed to have happened. It's the textbook dogma.

But it's wrong. They were human and smart. They adapted their

weapons and culture, and they survived. (Webber 1988:ex. 1)

that depends on discourse segments having their own mental reality. Moreover, discourse segmentation seems necessary to account for reference phenomena, as argued, for instance, by Grosz & Sidner (1986), whose theory of the structure of discourse includes also a discourse-model-like component of `focus of attention' where notions like reference are dealt with. Apparently, the position of an element in the hierarchical discourse structure determines the choice of referring expression in the consequent mention of that element. Reference phenomena are dealt with in the following section.

2.3.2 Reference Issues
It is clear that, as Prince 1988c puts it, `if a speaker evokes an entity in a discourse, s/he rst hypothesizes the information-status of that entity in the hearer's mind, with respect to both familiarity and saliency' (1988c:1).16 In other words, not all entities that enter a discourse may be encoded alike in the linguistic structure, since there are crucial di erences in the referential status of these entities. Entities may be known to hearers but not salient at the time of utterance, they may be salient at the
15Polanyi (1988) calls her theory of discourse structure a `discourse model'. Obviously, her use is di erent from the use of `discourse model' in, for instance, Prince 1981b or Webber 1982 as a hearer's mental model of the ongoing discourse containing entities, attributes, etc.
16As noted above, in Prince 1988c `information-status' means what referential status means here.

20

time of utterance, they may be completely new to the hearer, they may be inferrable from what the hearer knows, etc. These di erences in referential status determine the linguistic shape of the referring expressions that refer to these entities: speakers may use de nite NPs, inde nite NPs, pronouns, zero anaphora in some languages, and so forth, depending on the status of the entities they encode.
Prince (1981b, 1988b) o ers a taxonomy of referential status and its impact on the choice of referring expression. Prince 1988b, recasting her own `assumed familiarity hierarchy' (Prince 1981b), introduces the following distinctions in the referential status of discourse entities. On the one hand, entities may be discourseold or discourse-new: they may or may not be linguistically or contextually evoked, i.e. already introduced in the current discourse. On the other hand, they may be hearer-old or hearer-new, where hearer-old means already present in the hearer's knowledge-store via the current discourse or via previous knowledge. This distinction yields three possible referential statuses: discourse-new/hearer-new (new to the discourse and new to the hearer's knowledge-store), discourse-new/hearer-old (new to the discourse but known via previous knowledge to the hearer), and discourseold/hearer-old (evoked in the discourse and therefore in the hearer's knowledgestore).17 This categorization captures in a simple manner the many de nitions of givenness and newness that have haunted the linguistic literature for decades (Chafe-givenness, Clark-givenness, recoverability, conceptual de niteness, and so on, as proposed or discussed in Halliday 1967, Kuno 1972, Haviland & Clark 1974, Chafe 1976, Clark & Haviland 1977, among others). Prince's (1988b) categorization will be used here to refer to the referential status of discourse entities when necessary.
An intimately related|actually overlapping|issue is the continuation of reference to a given entity once that entity has already entered the previous linguistic context. That is, given a discourse model with several discourse entities, how do we encode each one of them? How do we keep track of which referential expression refers to which discourse entity? This was, as noted, one of the concerns of Grosz & Sidner (1986) and the main concern of Centering theory (cf. Grosz, Joshi
17The cell discourse-old/hearer-new is obviously empty. In Prince 1981b discourse-new/hearernew was called brand-new, discourse-new/hearer-old was called unused, and discourse-old/hearerold was called evoked. `Inferrable' entities represent another referential status, but will not be referred to here.
21

& Weinstein 1987 and related research). These theories provide an account of the di erent degrees of saliency of discourse entities in the discourse model across the text, i.e. how entities maintain or change their degree of saliency and how that affects their encoding in the linguistic structure. Another approach to this very same issue, stemming from a very di erent linguistic tradition, is found in the work of Givon (1983) and associates. Where Centering talks about degree of saliency, Givon talks about topicality or topic continuity, but both approaches are strikingly similar and share similar goals.18
Referential status is an absolute property of discourse entities, which is re ected in English and many other languages through the formal marking of NPs. It concerns the status of a given entity with respect to its presence or absence in the previous discourse or the hearer's discourse model or knowledge-store, depending on the approach. Several authors have made a point of noting that referential status must be teased apart from information packaging (cf. Reinhart 1982, Prince 1988c, ValimaaBlum 1988, Horn 1989, etc.). Other authors, however, de ne information packaging in terms of referential status (e.g. modern Prague School, Rochemont 1986). This approach is problematic. Let us consider the discourse in (13):
(13) a. The boss hates broccoli. b. But vegetables are important in a balanced diet, c. so he'll have to eat some anyway.
The discourse entity `the boss' is introduced into the discourse in (a), so at the time (c) is uttered its referential status is discourse-old, i.e. given, and, furthermore, since it was just introduced, we may assume it is salient. That is why, most approaches would say, `the boss' is encoded in a pronominal form in (c) (he). Now, the referential status of `the boss' at the time (c) is uttered is absolute: it is independent of the sentential context in which the referential expression he appears. Moreover, even if no mention of `the boss' was made in (c), this discourse entity would still be salient and discourse-old at the time (c) is uttered.
Similar observations apply to discourse-new and hearer-new entities. In sentence (14)b,
18Givon (1986) is addressed again in Chapter 3 (x 3.1.2) to dispel any potential confusion between his use of the term topic and the use of the term topic in the topic-comment framework.
22

(14) a. I was lost in the Colombian jungle. b. Suddenly, I stumbled onto a broccoli plantation.
The referent of the NP a broccoli plantation is neither previously mentioned nor hearer-old, i.e. it is not yet in the discourse model or in the hearer's knowledgestore. The inde niteness of the NP marks it as encoding a hearer-new entity. Again, the referential status of the entity `broccoli plantation' in the expression a broccoli plantation in (14) as hearer-new would be the same regardless of the actual sentence in which it occurs.
Information packaging, in contrast, is an intrinsically relational notion. A focus, for instance, is a focus only by virtue of its standing in a given relation to the other elements of the sentence in a packaging instruction. Let us consider (15) and (16):19

(15) a. Q: What is he going to have? b. A: He'll have F a broccoli quiche ] tonight.

(16) a. Q: Are you and John coming out to dinner? b. A: Oh, no. He's cooking broccoli, c. so I'll F stay home with him ] tonight.

The constituents a broccoli quiche and stay home with him are foci, they are the informative part of the sentence. In (15)b, the speaker assumes the hearer knows and is attending to something like `he is (or isn't) going to have something tonight'. With (15)b, the speaker singles a broccoli quiche out as the conveyer of information, while the remainder of the structure indicates to the hearer how to enter this information into her/his knowledge-store e ciently. Similarly, in (16)c, the speaker assumes the hearer knows and is attending to something like `she'll be doing something tonight'. Therefore, the speaker singles out stay home with him as the conveyor of information within this particular sentence, i.e. the speaker assumes in this particular utterance that, out of the propositional content of the sentence, only the predicate (minus the adverbial) makes a contribution to the hearer's knowledge-store.
In principle, referential status has nothing to do with this. Referential status is a re ection of the status of a given discourse entity with respect to the discourse model or the hearer's knowledge-store. Whether a discourse entity is old or new

than the element receiving prominence.

23

is independent of its ability to be informative within a given propositional context, i.e., to increase the knowledge of the hearer as a result of its standing in a particular sentence. In (15)b the focus a broccoli quiche encodes a discourse-new entity, but in (16)c the pronoun him, part of the focus, encodes the discourse-old entity `John'. If information packaging is divorced from referential status, the ability of foci to be either given or new is not surprising. Further evidence is provided by examples like (17), where the focus is just a pronominal form:
(17) At a grocery's cash register] a. S1:It's $1.20: : : ok: : : Here's your change and here's your broccoli. b. S2:Thank you. c. S1:Thank you.
Such cases, so-called `contrastive focus' (e.g. Rochemont 1986), are fairly common. There is no sense in which you in (17)c can be considered hearer- or discourse-new, but you is the focus nevertheless.20 The speaker assumes thanking (or not thanking) somebody is already being attended to by the hearer. The information conveyed by (17)c is exclusively located on you, which is thus properly singled out.
Consider also cases where the informative part of the utterance is not a referential expression but a predicate:
(18) The boss hates broccoli.
In what sense can one say that hates is hearer-new? If focus is de ned in terms of newness one is forced to state counterintuitively that hates in (18) is hearer-new (cf. Ward 1985, where this is also pointed out). And compare minimal pairs like (19), where the adverb tonight has a di erent information-packaging force in (a) and in (b), although its referential status is presumably the same:
(19) a. Guess what! John's coming tonight. b. Guess what! John's cooking tonight.
In (a) the speaker presumably assumes that John's coming sooner or later is in the hearer's knowledge-store and that tonight is informative with respect to this
20It may be said, as in Prince 1981a, 1986 (see x 3.1.4), that the referent of you is not new in absolute terms, but rather that what is new is the fact that you is what appears in the position of x in the context `thank x' in (c). This is correct and `newness' here is equivalent to `information' in our analysis. `Newness' in this sense is de nitely void of its meaning as a referential-status label.
24

knowledge. In (b), on the other hand, John's engaging in some activity tonight is presumably assumed to be uninformative, but cooking is assumed to be a contribution to the hearer's knowledge-store with respect to this knowledge about John and tonight. This, of course, is independent of whether the speaker assumes the entity `tonight' is in the hearer's knowledge-store or not (most likely s/he does). Clearly, a referential view of information packaging is at a loss in both (18) and (19) and the need for a relational notion becomes evident.
As noted above, von Stechow 1981 and Reinhart 1982 share the view that information packaging cannot be de ned in terms of referential status.21 Reinhart provides the following example:
(20) a. Who did Felix praise? b. Felix praised himself. (Reinhart 1982:ex. 37)
The referential expressions Felix and himself refer to one and the same entity `Felix'. Nevertheless, Felix is, following Reinhart, the topic of (20)b, while himself is the focus. It would seem, then, that the entity `Felix' is marked as being new just after it has been introduced, but, as von Stechow points out, `the information of a constituent like himself qua focus is not a referent' (1981:97). Identifying the information-packaging force of a constituent cannot be done on the basis of the referential status of the entity it represents.
Another well-known information-packaging notion is the topic. Reinhart argues
at length that topichood cannot be viewed as a property of referents either (1982:x5).
She says that, since elements other than the topic may encode discourse-old referents, it is insu cient to state that oldness is what identi es topics. Furthermore, she derives the fact that topics `strongly tend' to be discourse-old from independent reasons having to do with discourse cohesion. Notice, though, that topics need not be discourse-old in the strict sense of the word, as (21)b shows:
(21) a. I can't nd broccoli anywhere. b. Crack they sell at every corner, but broccoli it's like they don't grow it anymore.
The topicalized NP crack in (21)b, while a topic, is not discourse-old in the sense of being already evoked in the previous discourse. It is true that the entity `crack'
21Von Stechow 1981 actually draws from a prepublication draft of Reinhart 1982.
25

acquires some discourse-oldness by virtue of its standing in some relation to the discourse-old entity `broccoli', but the `discourse-oldness' of `crack' is quite peculiar and clearly deviant from the traditional meaning of givenness.22
Whether topichood is a property of constituents or referents or both is actually not very clear. What seems unjusti ed, following Reinhart, is to assume that the discourse task of topics is to mark or signal the referents they encode as hearerold. The data, as viewed by Reinhart 1982, Valimaa-Blum 1988, Horn 1989, and others, suggest that the hearer-oldness of a discourse entity encoded by a given linguistic expression may be a necessary condition for that expression to become a topic, but it is clearly not a su cient condition. If topics are hearer-old it is because discourse-oldness is a pre-condition for topichood, not because topichood is a marker of discourse-oldness in the strict sense.
Referential status and information packaging are distinct, i.e., the givenness/newness distinction and information-packaging notions like focus and topic are orthogonal to each other. However, given the nature of both phenomena and their intimate relationship within the linguistic apparatus, there are clear correlations between the two. Once the account of information packaging in Chapter 4 is introduced, the distinction between referential status and information packaging will be discussed further.
2.3.3 The Discourse Model
Pioneering work in this area was done by Karttunen (1971), where the idea of `discourse referent'|later renamed discourse entity|was introduced as a mental construct. This notion, as a mediation between referring expression and real-world referents, is extremely useful in accounting for some long-observed problems in all theories of reference encoding and resolution.
But the notion of discourse entity is generally not considered to be an isolated mental construct. Many approaches to reference place the discourse entity within a larger mental construct called the discourse model. A discourse model is a par-
22Ward 1985, and Ward & Prince 1986 identify the peculiar relation between `crack' and `broccoli' as a partially ordered set (poset) relation. Identity|when the referent of a topic expression is identical to a previously evoked entity, i.e. traditional givenness|is just one of many poset relations. This approach will be discussed below in x 4.3.2.
26

ticipant's evolving model of the discourse and contains a mental representation not only of the entities involved in the current discourse but also of their attributes and the links between them. Webber 1982, for instance, thinks of discourse entities as mental hooks on which attributes are hung. Discourse models have been used extensively to provide a formalization for the distinction between salient entities, nonsalient entities, and discourse-new/hearer-old entities.
Another view of discourse models is found in the work of Kamp 1981 and Heim 1983. Their theories are a hybrid between a dynamic truth-conditional semantics and a true theory of the discourse model. Kamp's discourse representation structures (DRSs) and Heim's le-change semantics provide both a discourse-model account of de niteness and a suprasentential method of truth-value computation. Despite this hybrid character, Heim's les and le cards seem to be analogous to Webber's (1982) discourse model and its hooklike entities. Each le card represents a discourse entity, and attributes and links with other entities are written on the card in the same way attributes are hung from Webber's hooks. Inde nites cause hearers to open a new le card (add a new hook) and de nites to retrieve a di erent but already existing le card (or hook). Heim's le card metaphor will be used in Chapter 4 to describe the hearer's knowledge-store. Kamp's DRSs, however, cannot be equated with Webber's hooks in any straightforward way but seem to be constructs that re ect some or all of the functions assigned to a discourse model as viewed above, have some of the characteristics of discourse segmentation and structure, and contain an alternative notation to represent logico-semantic operators of the traditional type.
2.4 Sentential Pragmatics
The pragmatic issues discussed in this section are of a di erent type in that the linguistic unit they concern is not the discourse but the sentence. These phenomena| actual-world felicity, empathy, illocution, and implicature|are pragmatic in that they all involve the context of utterance in a crucial way,23 but the linguistic e ects
23It is actually unclear whether all types of implicature involve the context of utterance. Conventional implicature and generalized conversational implicature, in particular, can be accounted for independently of the language users and the time and place of utterance, but since their contribution to meaning is non-truth-conditional, they are traditionally considered part of pragmatics (cf. Horn 1989:Ch. 2, Levinson 1983:Ch. 3).
27

they have are primarily felt at the sentential level, both in sentence structure and sentence in interpretation.
Some of these are more relevant to the topic of this dissertation than others. The relevance of each of the issues will be noted in each section.
2.4.1 Actual-world Felicity
It has been traditionally considered one of the central tasks of pragmatic inquiry to determine the set of contexts in which a given sentence may be uttered appropriately or felicitously (cf. Austin 1962, Lyons 1977). The felicity or infelicity of a given sentence is the result of several di erent factors. For instance, it may be infelicitous due to wrong referential encoding, the presence of contradictory empathy relationships, the encoding of implicata that cannot coexist with certain truth-conditional readings, or the use of unwarranted packaging instructions. To obtain acceptable utterances, therefore, the satisfaction of these linguistically-motivated felicity conditions is as important as the satisfaction of purely syntactic grammaticality requirements.
Nevertheless, there exists another kind of felicity condition which is clearly not linguistically based. Sometimes, sentences that are syntactically, semantically, and linguistico-pragmatically perfect still sound unacceptable when used in most contexts. The reason is that the contextual nonlinguistic conditions that we would need to make the sentence felicitous are never or rarely present in the world as we know it, which makes the sentence practically unusable or, equivalently, pragmatically unlikely. This kind of felicity may be called `actual-world felicity'.
Actual-world felicity, in fact, has no bearing whatsoever on the structural properties of language. However, it deserves mention here because in Chapter 7 this notion will be used in providing an account of the rarity of a certain type of sentences (sentences containing an exhaustiveness operator in non-association with focus) which our analysis predicts are syntactically and informationally well-formed.
Interestingly, one can nd in the recent linguistic literature accounts along these lines of several syntactic and semantico-pragmatic phenomena. For instance, Kroch 1989 argues that the putatively ungrammatical long wh-extraction from `non-referential' adjuncts (cf. Cinque 1989, Rizzi 1989), as in (22),
(22) (*)How much money was John wondering whether to pay?
28

is not ungrammatical at all. The reason for their awkwardness is that the existential claim presupposed by this sentence|that there existed a sum of money about which John was wondering whether to pay it|is possible but very odd, which renders the question in (22) unusable under most actual-world circumstances.
Similarly, Searle 1989 o ers a radical revision of the traditional analysis of performative verbs, in which the infelicity of (23)
(23) # I hereby fry an egg.
is not due to any inherent linguistic property of the verb fry, but to the fact that in the world as we know it, we cannot fry an egg by just saying that we fry an egg, even though an English-speaking almighty creature of sorts could clearly fry an egg by uttering (23).
2.4.2 Empathy
Empathy as a pragmatic component or perspective is basically de ned and studied in Kuno & Kaburaki 1977 and Kuno 1987. Chafe 1976 also refers to this phenomenon using the term `point of view', and his are the examples in (24), which illustrate the kind of data empathy sets out to account for:
(24) a. John hit his wife. b. Mary's husband hit her. (Chafe 1976:54)
While (24)a describes the facts from John's side, (24)b describes the facts from Mary's side. The speaker empathizes either with John (in (24)a) or with Mary (in (24)b). Kuno de nes empathy as `the speaker's identi cation, which may vary in degree, with a person/thing that participates in the event or state that he describes in a sentence' (1987:206), and along this de nition he sets a number of constraints to account for the infelicity of certain sentences like (25),
(25) # Mary's husband hit his wife.
which violate his ban on con icting empathy foci within one sentence. Kuno draws a convincing analogy between empathy and movie-making. The
speaker is like a lm director who can choose the location of the camera: given a scene involving A and B, the director can choose a neutral angle, can place the
29

camera closer to A (empathizing with A), or place it closer to B (empathizing with B). This notion of empathy seems relevant even for the use of some contrasting lexical items which re ect empathy relations, such as come/go and bring/take. Finally, choice of deictic elements (here/there or this/that) could also be thought of as re ecting speakers empathy or, metaphorically, the positioning of a camera over the event they report.
There is a de nite intuitive appeal behind the notion of empathy and a lot of lexical, morphological, and syntactic properties can be derived from it. Nevertheless, empathy falls outside the scope of this study. The reason for its inclusion
in this chapter is that Chafe, as noted in x 2.2, includes empathy under the label
`information packaging'. Information packaging as de ned in this study excludes empathy. Empathy, being the expression of speaker identi cation with a discourse participant, is unrelated to information packaging as de ned above.
2.4.3 Illocution
Beyond the mere locutionary act carried out in uttering a sentence with a given meaning, there is always an illocutionary act. The illocutionary force conventionally associated with a sentence utterance, i.e. what we do by means of a locutionary act, clearly a ects sentence structure. Di erent illocutionary forces|announcements, assertions, questions, commands, denials, requests, exclamations, etc. (cf. Levinson 1983: Ch. 5)|have di erent structural e ects on the syntax, the phonology, or both, and must, therefore, be coherently represented at some level.
Pioneering work on illocution was done from within the philosophical tradition by Austin (1962) and Searle (1969). A recent proposal by Jacobs (1984, 1986) includes the addition of an interpretive level for illocutionary meaning to our model of linguistic competence. In principle, illocution has very little in common with the topic of this study, but it is precisely Jacobs' work which motivates the inclusion of illocution here. Jacobs (1984, 1986) suggests that certain information-packaging notions are represented at the level of illocution.
Illocution, however, has to do with what kind of speech act is performed when a sentence is uttered. We may perform an act of commanding, requesting, denying a previous statement, and so on. Information packaging has to do with the information
30

carried by a given sentence at a given time-point. In principle, these two aspects of sentential `meaning' appear to be mutually independent. Some confusion may arise, however, from the ambiguity of the term `assertion' as used both with an illocutionrelevant sense and as an informationally-relevant notion. To `assert' as a speech act is based on Russell's (1905) use of the term with the sense of committing oneself to the truth of the statement one is uttering. Thus, when speakers Russell-assert sentence (26),
(26) The boss ate broccoli on Monday.
they commit themselves to the truth of the boss' having eaten broccoli on Monday. Jacobs (1984, 1986) proposes that informational notions like topic and focus be
represented at the level of illocutionary meaning. He views the focus of a sentence as the `focus of the assertion'. Whatever this means, it is obvious that Jacobs is not using the term `assertion' in the Russellian sense of the word. When uttering a sentence like (27), where broccoli is the focus,
(27) The boss ate broccoli on Monday.
speakers carry out the same Russell-assertion they carried out in uttering (26). When Jacobs states that (26) and (27) assert di erent things he is using `assert'
more in the sense of Stalnaker 1979. As will be seen below in x 3.1.4, for Stal-
naker `assertion' is a reduction of the context set, i.e. a contribution of information. Including Jacobs' notion of assertion into the list of speech acts, however, would signi cantly stretch the de nition of speech act, since it does not seem natural to view information packaging as belonging to the same class of acts as requests, commands, announcements, etc.24
2.4.4 Implicature
Ever since the seminal work of Grice (1975) implicature has enjoyed a central status within the eld of pragmatics. In order to preserve the truth-conditional approach
24Jacobs' line of argument is very interesting. He starts with cases in which focus is apparently associated with a scalar particle like only or even and licenses these foci, his `bound foci', by virtue of their being bound to the scalar particle (see Ch. 7, where it is argued that this kind of association is only an epiphenomenon). He then needs to nd a binder to license his `free foci'|normal foci that do not occur with a scalar particle|and he resorts to an abstract illocutionary `assertion' operator to perform the task.
31

to meaning that logical semantics had adopted, Grice suggests that the di erences that exist between most logical operators in rst-order logic and their natural language counterparts are to be accounted for by additional pragmatic mechanisms that operate above logical semantics. The gap between logic and natural language operators is bridged by a single principle, the Cooperative Principle, that comprises four maxims of conversation: the maxims of quality, quantity, relevance, and manner. See Levinson 1983, Green 1989, and Horn 1989 for surveys of the Gricean maxims and their coverage, and Horn 1984 and Sperber & Wilson 1986 for important modi cations of Grice's original proposals.
Observance and deliberate outing of Grice's maxims is what generates all the interpretive inferences above logico-semantic meaning that we call (conversational) implicatures.25 Among the best studied cases (cf. Gazdar 1979, Atlas & Levinson 1981, Horn 1981, 1984, Hirschberg 1985, etc.) we nd scalar implicature (if speakers assert that a given point in a given scale obtains, they also implicate that a higher point does not obtain), clausal implicature (given the assertion of a weak claim, we obtain the implicature that a stronger claim cannot be asserted at this point), and exhaustiveness (if speakers assert, in certain contexts, that `something' about a given entity is the case, they also implicate that the same `something' is not the case about another entity in the same salient set).
Implicature is responsible for many linguistic contrasts at the lexical, morphological, and syntactic level (cf. Horn 1981, Rubino 1987), from the presence of discourse particles like in fact to the morphology of re exives in some languages and, partly, for the existence of constructions like it-clefts, under some analyses (cf. Atlas & Levinson 1981). But our interest in implicature here stems from a crucial di erence that exists between it and another area of pragmatic interpretation, information packaging. It has been argued (Atlas & Levinson 1981, Levinson 1983) that implicatures cannot be obtained directly from uninterpreted surface syntactic struc-
25Conventional implicatures, in Grice's original formulation, are not obtained with the use of the maxims but are attached by convention to particular lexical items. So, for example, the `contrast' implicature in (i)
(i) He's poor but honest.
is conventionally attached to the lexical item but. With some additional assumptions, however, conventional implicatures can be made to follow from the maxims in the same way conversational implicatures do.
32

tures but have to be derived from logico-semantic structures. If this is correct, the interpretive component in which implicatures are computed and interpreted must be linked, in the model of linguistic competence, not to the syntax but to the truthconditional, logico-semantic component. In fact, Atlas & Levinson 1981 suggest that implicatures be consistently incorporated into the logical form of sentences.
As noted above, our working assumption is that logico-semantic meaning is relevant for information packaging only indirectly. Of course, there would be no information without the existence of propositional content. However, it is not necessary that information packaging bleed logico-semantic meaning, since surface syntactic structure may feed both information packaging and logical semantics in parallel. In other words, the sentence is structured to encode both propositional content and information simultaneously. If this approach is correct, there exists an important di erence between implicature and information packaging: while the pragmatic understanding obtained from implicatures lies beyond logico-semantic meaning, the pragmatic understanding obtained from information packaging is interpreted along with, not after, logico-semantic meaning.
2.5 Summary
Pragmatics is a eld of inquiry with a very wide scope. Under the label `pragmatic competence' linguists subsume phenomena that in fact belong to di erent modules of our linguistic apparatus. When the phenomena surveyed here are incorporated into our linguistic competence with precision, it is obvious that they cannot possibly all t within one `pragmatic component'.
The focus of this study, information packaging, is just one of the linguistic modules currently studied under pragmatics. In consequence, the account of information packaging presented here should not be expected to account for every pragmatic aspect of language understanding. As de ned, information packaging has a very speci c role in language understanding and production, and only matters relevant to this role should be taken into account when building up a theory. Of course, which matters are actually relevant is ultimately an empirical question.
Several other interpretive components of language will, of course, be in close relation to informatics, and all sorts of indirect interactions and statistical correlations
33

should be expected. In particular, one should expect interaction between informatics and the referential status of discourse entities and logical semantics. The existing literature on these issues con rms these expectations.

Chapter 3
Informational Articulations: An assessment
In x 3.1 the several informational articulations put forward in the literature are critically reviewed. The discussion in x 3.2 contains a global evalution of their insights
and shortcomings and, based on this evaluation, a trinomial hierarchical articulation is proposed. Finally, the di erences and similarities between the hierarchical trinomial articulation and previous approaches are discussed.26
3.1 Previous Approaches
A number of proposals for the informational articulation of the sentence|sometimes incompatible|are found in the literature. The di erences among them are significant but they can be grouped, as will be done below, in two larger approaches. What all the approaches have in common is the recognition that in the sentence there is some sort of informational split between a more informative part and a less informative part. Where that split is and what kind of split it is|a continuum or a dichotomy|is a matter of disagreement, but the split is nevertheless present. In our terms, it could be said that information is concentrated on a subpart of the sentence, while the remainder is licensed only as an anchoring vehicular frame for that informative part to guarantee an optimal entry into the hearer's knowledge-store.
In the next sections, the following approaches will be reviewed, pointing out their di erences, their similarities, their insights, and their shortcomings:
26Some of the issues discussed in this chapter were the topic of a paper presented at the 1990 International Pragmatics Conference in Barcelona, July 9-13.
35

theme-rheme (Ammann 1928, Danes 1968(1957), Firbas 1964, 1971, 1975, Halliday 1967, Contreras 1976).
topic-comment (Mathesius 1915, Hockett 1958, Strawson 1964, Gundel 1974, 1988, Dahl 1974, Li & Thompson 1976, Kuno 1980, Reinhart 1982, Davison 1984).
topic-focus (Sgall & Hajicova 1977-78 and many others by them and their associates (cf. Hajicova 1984 for a relation), von Stechow 1981).
focus-presupposition or focus/open-proposition (Akmajian 1970(1979), Chomsky 1971, Jackendo 1972, Dahl 1974, Rochemont 1978, 1986, Wilson & Sperber 1979, Williams 1981, Prince 1981a, 1984, 1986, Selkirk 1984, Ward 1985, Lambrecht 1987, 1988, Valimaa-Blum 1988).
dominance (Erteschik-Shir 1973, 1979, 1986, Erteschik-Shir & Lappin 1979, 1983).
The shortcomings these proposals contain can be classi ed into two types: de nitional problems and incomplete empirical coverage. Both types are discussed for each one of the approaches.
3.1.1 Theme-Rheme
The terms thema and rhema, according to Hajicova 1984:190, were introduced by Ammann 1928. In the theme-rheme perspective, the rheme is the informative part of the utterance, and the theme is the anchoring or vehicular part. While the authors that work in this framework, listed above, agree in this respect, they also use the term `theme' is di erent ways. There are, at least, two `themes', that will be called Firbas-theme and Halliday-theme. Firbas 1964, 1971 and Danes 1968(1957)
operate with the notion of `communicative dynamism' (cf. x 2.2 above) de ned as
a continuum into which all sentence elements fall. Firbas asserts that `the theme is constituted by the sentence element (or elements) carrying the lowest degree(s) of communicative dynamism within the sentence' (1964:272). It is, therefore, the least informative part of the sentence. The rheme pushes the communication forward the most and may be viewed as the informative part of the sentence. Contreras' (1976)
36

theme-rheme articulation is taken directly from Firbas', although he does away with the continuum in favor of a discrete dichotomy.
For Halliday, the theme `is what is being talked about, the point of departure for the clause as a message', and it is `what comes rst in the clause' (1967:212). Halliday illustrates this with the three sentences in (28) (1967:212),
(28) a. John saw the play yesterday. b. Yesterday John saw the play. c. The play John saw yesterday.
where, in his view, the themes are, respectively, John, yesterday, and the play. In Halliday's system, the rheme is de ned merely as the complement of the theme. Firbas-theme and Halliday-theme may coincide in a given sentence, but they need not. Firbas, for example, is careful to remark that it is wrong to consistently associate the theme with the beginning of the sentence (1964:274), which enters in clear con ict with Halliday's assumptions.27
Even without understanding the full implications and technicalities of Firbas's and Halliday's theories, one can appreciate the di erence between their two interpretations of the notion theme. Interestingly, a Firbas-theme is more or less analogous to the topic in the topic-focus framework, while a Halliday-theme is almost equivalent to the topic in the topic-comment framework. Given these equivalences, then, we will subsume the discussion of theme-rheme under the discussion of each of these, pointing out the relevant di erences between either theme and either topic as needed.
3.1.2 Topic-Comment
Along with the focus-presupposition approach, it is one of the most widely found in modern American linguistics. They are mutually (partially) incompatible. Unfortunately, the term `topic' has been used in the literature with a multiplicity of denotations. This has led to important misunderstandings. Before moving on, in order to try to avoid confusion, some uses of the term `topic' that will not be dealt with here should be mentioned.
27Halliday's (1967) system is extremely complex. He also invokes the notions `given' and `new', and develops a theory of information units that interact with the syntactic structure of the sentence in intrincate ways.
37

First, there is the notion of discourse topic (Keenan-Ochs & Schie elin 1976, Bayer 1980): a given text is understood as being about a certain proposition or a certain discourse entity, which is the topic of that text. This is a suprasentential notion, with no relevance for sentential structure, even though the topic of a discourse may be linguistically represented in one or more of the sentences in that discourse.28
Second, there is Givon's (1983) topicality. Topicality is a property that all participants in a discourse possess to a larger or a lesser degree. The degree of topicality|also called continuity|of a referent will determine the way it is encoded by referential expressions as well as, Givon claims, word order. In Chapter 2,
Givon's topicality was included in x 2.3.2, since the theory of topic continuity ac-
tually deals with referential status of entities with respect to their presence in the previous discourse and not with information packaging of propositions as de ned above.29 The most topical referents need the `weakest' encoding|zero-anaphora or pronominalization|and the least topical the strongest|inde nite NPs. Comparisons with Givon's topic will be drawn as needed through this discussion.
Let us now focus on the topic-comment articulation. Mathesius 1915, one of the precursors of the notion of `aboutness', articulates the sentence into what the speaker wants to speak about, the topic, and what is to be said about this topic (cf. Hajicova 1984). About four decades later, Hockett 1958 a rms that `the most general characteristic of predicative constructions is suggested by the terms \topic" and \comment" for their ICs immediate constituents]: the speaker announces a topic and then says something about it' (1958:201), and illustrates it with the sentences
in (29), where the vertical line (j) separates the topic from the comment:

(29)

a. b.

John That

j ran away.
new book by

Thomas

Guernsey

yet.

It is precisely the shared notion of `aboutness' which underlies these two views that is crucial in the make-up of the topic-comment approach. The topic is what the sentence is about the comment what we say about it. Example (29)a is about

28See Valimaa-Blum 1988 for discussion of the di erence between sentential topic and discourse topic and an interpretation of the latter as a psychological Gestalt.
29Amidst the terminological maze around `topic' and the inescapable confusion that comes with it, it is nice to observe that while Givon and associates talk about the `topicality' of a constituent, the workers in the topic-comment framework talk about its `topichood', re ecting the fact that they are talking about two di erent things.

38

John, i.e. John is the topic, and the comment is that he ran away. This notion is extremely widespread and is used in many accounts of word order
variation in the most diverse languages (cf. Gundel 1987 and Herring 1990 for a crosslinguistic survey). Pragmatic aboutness, as we know it now, is rst outlined within the philosophical tradition in Strawson 1964 and rst adopted into linguistic research in a systematic way by Gundel 1974.30 Up to this point, however, the only de nition available for aboutness was that of Mathesius and Hockett or variations on it.31
Reinhart 1982 notices that the notion of pragmatic aboutness needs explication. She adopts Strawson's (1964) insights, but she further combines them with the pragmatic analysis of assertions in Stalnaker (1978), incorporating his idea of `context set' into her explication of aboutness. She suggests that the context set| Stalnaker's set of propositions accepted to be true at a given time by speaker and hearer in common|is organized and classi ed in some way by speakers and it is in this classi cation that topics play a role: `sentence-topics, within this view, are one of the means available in the language to organize, or classify the information exchanged in linguistic communication|they are signals for how to construct the context set, or under which entries to classify the new proposition' (1982:24). For Reinhart, then, a topic represents an address or a le card|she explicitly uses this metaphor|under which the oncoming information, i.e. the comment, is stored or classi ed in the context set.32
In the sentences in (29), for instance, the propositions John ran away and I haven't read that new book by Thomas Guernsey yet would be classi ed in the context set under John and that new book by Thomas Guernsey, respectively. Notice that Reinhart's system, within which topics play a role, is, in a sense, reminiscent of
30Independently, and stemming directly from Mathesius', Firbas', and Halliday's work, the notion of `theme' or `topic' is found in Kuno 1972 and Dik 1978, for instance.
31See, for example, the de nition of topic in Gundel 1988:210, an elaboration on the notion of `aboutness':
`An entity, E, is the topic of a sentence, S, i in using S the speaker intends to increase the addressee's knowledge about, request information about, or otherwise get the addressee to act with respect to E.'
32Reinhart's adaptation of Stalnaker's context set substantially alters his original conception of the notion.
39

the approach to information packaging presented in this dissertation. Both analyses use the idea of information retrieval and entry and both make use of the vision of `topic' as an address of sorts. The di erence between the two analyses are several
and important and will become apparent as our analysis is developed (cf. x 3.2).
Despite these di erences, however, Reinhart's contribution provides us with a more explicit de nition of what topichood is.33
All the cases of topic seen so far have in common that the topic phrase is sentenceinitial: it is either the subject or a preposed, `topicalized' phrase. In fact, the sentence-initial position for preposed constituents is called the `topic slot'. According to Gundel 1988, for instance, any constituent found in this slot must be interpreted as the topic of the sentence. It is not the case, however, that the topic of the sentence has to be encoded in sentence-initial position. Any (referential) phrase in a sentence is allowed to be the topic of that sentence, depending on the interpretation intended (cf. Reinhart 1982, Davison 1984, Gundel 1988).34 In a sentence like (30),
(30) Rosa is standing near Felix. (Reinhart 1982, ex. 24)
the topic could be, depending on the context, either Rosa or Felix (even though Reinhart points out that Felix is an `unexpected' topic).
Now, the main problem with the topic-comment approach is precisely that of identifying what the sentence is about, i.e. identifying the topic. If we are forced to take the sentence-initial phrase as a topic, sentence-initialness can be used as an operational criterion to identify topics. If we take the position that the topic can be encoded in any position in the sentence, identi cation becomes problematic. The authors working in the topic-comment framework, especially Gundel (1974) and Reinhart (1982), have set a number of tests for topichood which are meant to provide an operational tool to identify the topic of a sentence: the `as-for' test, the `what-about' test, and the `said-about' test. The rst one determines that an NP is
33There is one further di erence between Reinhart's and Gundel's topics. For Reinhart topichood is a property of constituents (which encode a given discourse entity), but for Gundel it is a property of entities (which are encoded in a given constituent).
34Gundel 1988 actually states that `a pragmatic topic is not always encoded as a syntactic topic =in the sentence-initial topic slot] in fact, a pragmatic topic does not have to have overt expression in the sentence at all' (1988:211). It seems odd to assume that the informational articulation of a given sentence may contain a topic if this topic is not represented in the structure of the sentence at all. It seems that Gundel's view of topic here has been modi ed to include aspects of the discourse topic and Givon's topic.
40

the topic of a sentence if it can be left-detached and preceded by as for. The second one establishes that an NP is the topic of a sentence if this sentence can answer the question What about x?, where x is the topic NP. The third one identi es the topic with the NP that can be inserted as x in the frame She said about x that `comment'.
Unfortunately, these tests are problematic, as Gundel herself indirectly suggests (1974:110) and as Prince 1984, Ward 1985 and Vallduv 1988a argue with examples from English and Catalan. For example, many examples of `topicalized' phrases, which are, following Gundel, necessarily topics, fail to pass the tests, rendering these tests too strong. In particular, 69% of the topicalizations in Ward's corpus fail the `as-for' test and 53% fail the `what-about' test (Ward 1985:23). The tests, furthermore, are too weak in that they identify as topics of the sentence more than one element. Let us take the sentence Linguistics fascinated me. In the discourse in (31) the topic of this sentence would be, following Reinhart's and Gundel's criteria, linguistics.

(31)

She told me I needed a change in my life, like getting a new

job. It was to no avail. Linguistics fascinated me. Wall Street

would have to wait.

But both linguistics and me seem to pass the aforementioned tests:

(32) a. i. I said about linguistics that it fascinated me. ii. (?) As for linguistics, it fascinated me. iii. What about linguistics? It fascinated me.
b. i. I said about myself that linguistics fascinated me. ii. As for myself, linguistics fascinated me. iii. What about myself? Linguistics fascinated me.
The conclusion that the notion of topic used in the topic-comment framework, as it stands, is not operationalizable seems unavoidable.
As noted above in x3.1.1, Halliday 1967 also de nes his Halliday-theme in terms
of aboutness, so he should run into the same problems as the workers in the topiccomment framework. Halliday, however, is very strict in requiring that the Hallidaytheme be sentence-initial. This is a positive move in two respects: rst, with this requirement we regain the operationability lost in letting any constituent be the topic and, second, it is more consistent to use `topic' to designate only those phrases that intuitively feel like they are directing the hearer to some element about which

41

the speaker will consequently assert something. This is actually the spirit behind Mathesius' and Hockett's notion of `aboutness'.35
Unfortunately, Halliday's strictness about sentence-initialness leads him to state that all sentence-initial elements are a Halliday-theme. This is a counterintuitive position, as seems clear from his sentence in (33) (1967:222),
(33) What j did John see yesterday?
where he claims that what is the Halliday-theme of the sentence. In a sentence of this type Gundel and Reinhart would choose the subject John as the topic. Furthermore, and this applies to Reinhart as well, it seems extreme to claim that all sentences have a topic. Both Gundel (1985:94) and Valimaa-Blum (1988:21) argue that topicless sentences exist and so do, in a di erent vein, Kuroda 1972 and Sasse 1987|their thetic-judgment sentences. If this position is correct, Halliday's sentence-initial requirement, while positive in certain respects, is too strong in at least two counts.
It is not just the de nitional problems around the notion of aboutness that weaken the solidity of the topic-comment approach. The incompleteness of empirical coverage of the topic-comment articulation is also an important shortcoming that must be resolved. This incomplete empirical coverage is due to the fact that a mere division between topic and comment does not su ce to capture all the informational distinctions detected in a sentence. This becomes clear in sentences like (34):
(34) a. She gave the shirt to Harry. (Prince 1986:ex. 1) b. To Harry she gave the shirt.
The two sentences in (34) represent one and the same logico-semantic proposition, but they also re ect two di erent information-packaging structures. Within the topic-comment framework, the contrast between these two sentences can be accounted for by saying that the phrase to Harry is a topic in (b) but not in (a) and that that is why it is preposed in the former but not in the latter. In (a) the topic is most likely she and the comment gave a shirt to Harry. This is indeed intuitively plausible and accounts for one of the informational splits of this sentence.
35See, for example, the de nition of topic in Bland 1980 (in Ward 1985:33): `The T opic] provides a way for the Sp eaker] to retrieve something from previous discourse in order to indicate what s/he is going to talk about before s/he actually does talk about it' (1980:3) emphasis not in original].
42

However, there is another clear informational split, especially in (a), that the topic-comment framework has nothing to say about. In (a) there is a clear informational distinction between the prosodically-prominent a shirt and the nonprominent to Harry, even though they are both within the comment. This distinction within the informationally-complex comment is left unaccounted for. The binomiality of the topic-comment articulation is not enough to capture the informational subtleties of both (34)a and (34)b. The prosodically-prominent part of the comment in (34)a is what the focus/open-presupposition approach calls `focus', and the nonprominent part of the comment that follows the focus is part of the open-proposition (along with the topic). The focus corresponds to only a segment of the comment. Focus, therefore, must be invoked to complement the topic-comment division if we wish to account for the information-packaging articulation of the sentence.
Before concluding this section on the topic-comment articulation, it is worth speculating on the source of the de nitional problem described above. There is a clear intuitive notion that the sentence-initial `topic' phrase has some special informational standing within the sentence. This is the original intuition behind the notion of topic as found in Mathesius 1915 and Hockett 1958. The problem arises when one tries to extend this notion to other sentences, so as to force the topic-comment articulation onto all structures.
This extension is done, it seems, at the cost of causing the pervasive confusion and amalgamation of three phenomena labeled topic: a) the original topic, a sentenceinitial phrase that acts as an address for the appropriate entering of information and becomes a topic only relationally with respect to the comment|a true informationpackaging primitive b) topicality as a measure of the salience of a discourse entity, as in Givon 1983, that re ects the status of that entity with respect to its presence or absence in the previous discourse. This is most obvious in the variants of the theory that suggest topichood is a property of discourse entities, and especially in Davison 1984 and c) the suprasentential notion of discourse-topic, referring to an entity, proposition, or event that is felt to be the topic of a discourse, i.e. what that discourse is about, which may or may not be structurally encoded in all of the sentences contained in the discourse in question. This is especially so in the literature on topic in some Asian languages (e.g. Li & Thompson 1976 cf. ValimaaBlum 1988:18-27) and in Gundel 1988, where she states that topics need not be
43

expressed in the sentences they are topics of. Let us compare Givon's topicality with standard topichood with example (35):
(35) a. Does he want mustard on his broccoli? b. i. I don't think so, thanks. Brown mustard he likes, ii. but this yellow stu he doesn't touch.
The Givon-topic of sentence (b.ii) is he. It is the most salient entity and is therefore `weakly' encoded in a pronominal form. The topic in Hockett's sense is clearly this yellow stu : it announces a topic about which we then say something. These two notions of topic, as pointed out, are clearly distinct. Some workers in the topiccomment framework, having tried to con ate the two into one overarching `topic', have lost consistency and operationalizability in the process.36
Summing up, the topic-comment articulation introduces a useful notion to account for the existence of a sentence-initial constituent in many clauses (especially Reinhart's explicit characterization of it). It is su cient to capture the informational split of the sentence in simple cases where there is a leftmost `topic' phrase|be it an overtly topicalized phrase or a topical subject|and a noncomplex comment. Unfortunately, it seems inadequate to deal with all sentence types, given the common occurrence of complex comments like the one in (34)a.
3.1.3 Topic-Focus
The topic-focus articulation is the one defended by most present-day Prague School linguists (cf. Sgall, Hajicova & Panevova 1986) and other European scholars like von Stechow (1981). Within Prague School linguistic theory, informational considerations are just one of several that constitute the underlying or tectogrammatical representation of the sentence. In contrast, von Stechow (1981) views the topic-focus articulation as a structuring of logico-semantic propositions.
The de nitions of topic and focus are phrased in terms of contextual boundedness or contextual freeness, respectively, where contextually bound means `accessible in the hearer's memory, i.e. salient, activated over a certain threshold in the stock of
36Even when the two notions are con ated, their disparate structural behavior requires some terminological means to distinguish between `contrastive or shifted topics' (=sentence-initial aboutness expressions) and `continuous topics' (=Givon-topics) (cf. Herring 1990).
44

shared knowledge' (Hajicova 1984:193). A sentence like (36), with prosodic prominence on dams,
(36) Beavers build dams. (S., H. & P. 1986:57)
is claimed to display, in isolation, an informational three-way ambiguity: a) beavers is the topic and build dams is the focus b) beavers build is the topic and dams is the focus and c) the entire sentence is part of the focus and the topic is null.
Notice from this example that `topic' here is not analogous to `topic' in the topic-comment framework. The latter kind of topic for sentence (36) would be invariably beavers. The Prague notion of topic encompasses the topic-comment notion of topic and a part of its comment. In the next section it will be noted that the Prague School topic is equivalent to the open-proposition in the focus/open-
proposition approach. Similarly, the Firbas-theme discussed above in x 3.1.1 is also
equivalent to the Prague School topic, even though the former is de ned in terms of communicative dynamism (`pushing the conversation forward') and not in terms of contextual boundedness (`salience in hearer's memory'). Contextual-boundedness
is indeed a property of the nonfocal part of the sentence (cf. x 2.3.2, x 3.2), but
this is an artifact of its informational role in the sentence. More problematic is the
de nition of focus as contextually free, since in x 2.3.2 it was noted that a focus
constituent may encode discourse-old, even salient, entities. The focus-topic articulation is, for all intents and purposes, equivalent to the
focus-open-proposition articulation. Discussion of its advantages and shortcomings is therefore subsumed under the discussion of the latter articulation undertaken in the next section.
3.1.4 Focus/Open-proposition
The focus/open-proposition articulation or focus-presupposition articulation has a strong history in modern linguistics. The term `focus' has its origin in Halliday (1967), who uses it to designate a subset of the rheme in his theme-rheme articulation which he calls the `informative part'. While focus is the informative part of the sentence, the open-proposition is just the anchoring or vehicular part. It is important to point out that (a subpart of) the focus constituent is always marked by prosodic prominence, which happens to be a valuable operational criterion to
45

identify the focus in a given sentence. The term `focus' soon made its way into generative grammar, due mainly to its role in the battle between interpretive and generative semantics (cf. Chomsky 1971, Jackendo 1972). Sometimes it is also called, somewhat misleadingly, `focus of new information'. Although there does not seem to be as much terminological confusion around `focus' as there is around `topic', a couple of paragraph's worth of clari cation is in order.
In the last decade the term `focus' has been introduced into computational linguistics with a very di erent denotation. This use of `focus' originates in the work of Grosz and Sidner (Grosz 1977, Sidner 1979, 1981, Grosz & Sidner 1986) and is found in much work in arti cial intelligence (AI). This `focus' is of no direct relevance for information packaging. As mentioned above, the notion of a `focus stack' is used in Grosz & Sidner's (1986) theory of discourse-entity salience and encoding. All discourse entities are ranked for salience in the focus stack. The most salient entity at a given point, which is generally encoded in a pronominal form, is called the (AI-)focus. The AI-focus is the equivalent of the backward-looking center (BLC) in the Centering approach, and, ironically, it also corresponds to the most topical element, i.e. the topic, in Givon's (1983) framework37
Another less common use of the term `focus' is as `focus of contrast'. Contrast is yet another term which is used ambiguously in the literature, there existing both a contrastiveness of sentence-initial topics and a contrastiveness of foci. Chafe (1976) uses `focus of contrast' to refer to both types of contrast with unfortunate results, since he ends up referring to some topics as foci (of contrast). This confusion seems to have been inherited by a few studies like Diesing 1988, where contrastive topics are equated to (narrow) foci of new information. Some issues regarding contrast
will be discussed below in x 4.3.2.38
In modern American linguistics the focus of new information, or just `focus',
37See Hajicova 1987 for a comparison of AI-focus and focus. This paper also contains a discussion of how information packaging and entity salience may interact.
38An extreme case of misguiding terminology is found in the literature on Philippine languages, where, according to Herring (1990:fn.1), `topic' designates the focus and `focus' designates the topic. Just in case the reader has lost count of the di erent types of topic and focus, here is a brief list: discourse-topic, Givon-topic, sentence-initial topic (or topic-topic, if we may put one over the others), and Prague-topic (= topic-topic + part of the comment), and AI-focus (= Givon-topic), focus of new information (or focus-focus), and focus of contrast (= sometimes a focus-focus and sometimes a topic-topic).
46

was introduced as a complement of the presupposition in the focus-presupposition articulation (Akmajian 1970(1979), Chomsky 1971, Jackendo 1972, inter alia). The presupposition, following Jackendo , `denote s] the information in the sentence that is assumed by the speaker to be shared by him and the hearer' (1972:230). For Prince (1981a, 1984, 1986)|Prince uses the term open-proposition instead of presupposition|the presupposition is also `shared knowledge', which in most cases is salient (i.e. currently in the discourse model or consciousness of the hearer), and Chafe 1976, analogously states that the presupposition represents background knowledge. In Wilson & Sperber 1979 it corresponds to a logico-semantic background entailment of the actual sentence. More recently, Culicover & Rochemont 1983 and Rochemont 1986 have de ned the presupposition of a sentence as that which is c-construable, where c-construable means having a `semantic' antecedent in the previous discourse.
The focus, then, is generally de ned negatively as the complement of this presupposition it is, respectively, that which is not shared by the speaker and the hearer, that which is not background knowledge, that which is not part of the ( rst) background entailment, or that which is not c-construable. This is generally represented as follows: the presupposition is equated to the sentence (or proposition) with a variable substituted for the focus. So, for instance, a sentence like (37)a has the `presupposition' in (37)b, with the shirt as focus:
(37) a. She gave the shirt to Harry. b. She gave x to Harry. (Prince 1986:ex. 1)
In other words, sentence (37)a `presupposes' She gave something to Harry and the focus says that that something is the shirt.
Although this articulation has great intuitive appeal and has proved useful in the description of information packaging, most of the particular proposals just mentioned are problematic in some way. First, as pointed out already by Jackendo (1972:246), analyses that assume that the `presupposition' is entailed or presupposed in the traditional sense of the word (e.g. Wilson & Sperber 1979) run into immediate trouble when dealing with examples like (38)a:
(38) a. I saw nobody at the party. b. I saw x at the party.
47

If (a) were to entail or presuppose (b) we would run into a logical contradiction: if it is true that I saw nobody at the party then it is true that I saw somebody at the party (entailment), or that seeing nobody at the party presupposes seeing somebody at the party (presupposition). Clearly, the `presupposition' can be neither entailed nor presupposed by a given focus-presupposition sentence.39 This has led several authors to abandon the unhappy term `presupposition' and adopt Prince's (1981a, 1986) open-proposition (cf. Ward 1985).
Prince's view of the open-proposition as salient shared knowledge is less problematic as far as this issue is concerned. If `shared knowledge' is understood as the set of propositions believed to be true by both speaker and hearer at the time of utterance, as Jackendo 1972 did, using shared knowledge is no less problematic: the open-proposition in (38)b, being shared knowledge, would have to be believed true by the speaker. This cannot be the case here, since the speaker of (38)a cannot believe (38)b to be true. But if shared knowledge is viewed, as in Prince's work, as `what the speaker assumes about the hearer's beliefs' (Prince 1985:65), we do not run into the problem of assigning contradicting beliefs to the speaker. Speakers can utter (38)a if they assume that the hearer believes (38)b to be true, even when they themselves do not believe it to be true.
Culicover & Rochemont's (1983) c-construability is not free of problems either. C-construable means `having an antecedent in the previous discourse' and focus is described as not being c-construable. In many cases, however, the focus of a sentence refers to an entity already introduced into the previous discourse, i.e., the focus is as c-construable as its corresponding open-proposition. Rochemont (1986) calls the cases in which the focus is c-construable `contrastive focus' and stipulates a rule by means of which c-construable contrastive foci are allowed. In this case it is the fact that the focus is the focus of a particular focus/open-proposition structure| and not of some other|which is not c-construable. Although this takes care of the facts, a uni ed characterization of focus is lost in the process. Rochemont's problem stems from the unwarranted assumption that information packaging can be explained in terms of the absolute referential status of discourse entities as observed
39A misunderstanding based on this misleading ambiguity was at the root of a controversy between Chomsky 1971 and Lako 1971 and is the main reason for which Erteschik-Shir (1973, 1986) rejects the notion of focus in favor of dominance (cf. x 3.1.5).
48

in the previous linguistic context. In fact, Prince (1981a, 1984, 1986) points out that it is always the case that the
`new information' carried along by the focus is not a discourse-entity-based notion. What constitutes new information is the fact that a particular focus instantiates the variable in the open-proposition. For example, in example (37) above, repeated here as (39),
(39) a. She gave the shirt to Harry. b. She gave x to Harry. (Prince 1986:ex. 1)
the new information is not the shirt per se, i.e. the discourse entity represented by the NP the shirt, but the fact that the constituent the shirt is what instantiates the variable in the open-proposition she gave x to Harry. Prince's account, therefore, is equivalent to a generalization of Rochemont's proposal for just contrastive foci to all cases of focus. Thus, the need to state two separate c-construability conditions for two putatively di erent kinds of foci is avoided.
Besides, Prince's analysis of focus/open-proposition informational relations makes crucial use of a relational view of focus and open-proposition. A given constituent is the focus of a sentence by virtue of its being in a particular relation with the open-proposition in that sentence. This is in accordance with the fact that focushood cannot be an absolute property of constituents/referents, the way newness or givenness is. The notion of focus cannot be de ned in terms of c-construability, contextual-freeness, or hearer-newness.
There is another bit of terminology that must be introduced regarding the focus/open-presupposition articulation. Chomsky 1971, Jackendo 1972, von Stechow 1981, and Lambrecht 1987, 1989 state that the focus is the `assertion of the utterance'. This use of `assertion' must not be confused with the use of assertion as found in the philosophical writing of Russell (1905) in the sense of commitment to the truth of a statement, which is an illocutionary notion. Rather, it is based on Strawson's (1950) adaptation in the sense of `to give information of some kind to an audience' (cf. Kempson 1975:101), and, especially, on Stalnaker 1978, for whom
`to make an assertion is to reduce the context set = set of possible worlds compatible with what is accepted to be true by both speaker and hearer at a given time-point] in a particular way ...]. The particular
49

way in which the context set is reduced is that all the possible situations incompatible with what is said are eliminated.' (1978:323)
This de nition of assertion is similar to the de nition of information as a reduction of uncertainty introduced above in 2.2. The di erence is that while `information' was de ned as a reduction of the uncertainty in the hearer's knowledgestore at a given time-point, Stalnaker de nes his assertion as a reduction of uncertainty in the set of common beliefs shared by both hearer and speaker. Some authors have adopted Stalnaker's assertion to de ne the notion of focus in the focuspresupposition articulation (e.g. von Stechow 1981, Lambrecht 1987, 1988). These authors state that sentences assert their focus and that the open-proposition is not asserted. As noted in the discussion regarding (38), Stalnaker's asertion cannot be taken to de ne the focus/open-proposition distinction or the informativeness of the focus, since it is incorrect to assume that the open-proposition represents a `shared belief'. It is the hearers' belief (at least the speaker assumes so), but clearly it is not a shared belief. Despite this observation, one can easily see that, when these authors say that the focus is the Stalnaker-assertion of the utterance|a reduction of the context set, they are close to saying that it is the informative part of the utterance|a reduction of the uncertainty in the hearer's knowledge-store at a given time-point.
Finally, before discussing the incompleteness of empirical coverage of the focusopen-proposition approach, the work of Valimaa-Blum (1988) must be mentioned. Valimaa-Blum's informational articulation is identical to the focus/open-proposition articulation discussed here. In general, the discussion in this section is applicable to her approach. Her terminology, however, is quite di erent from the standard one in an unfortunate way. She calls the focus `NewInfo' and the open-proposition `OldInfo'. We share her use of `info(rmation)' to refer to the component of language understanding under study, but the use of the terms `old' and `new' is, again, misleading in the sense that it is reminiscent of the old/new distinction regarding the referential status of discourse entities. The problem is only terminological, however, since she states very clearly that NewInfo and OldInfo must be viewed as relational notions among constituents and not as a property of entities in a discourse (1988:5). Valimaa-Blum, along with the NewInfo-OldInfo articulation, also makes use of a
50

sentential sentence-initial topic. Her topic (S-topic) is based on `aboutness' a la Reinhart 1982, but, unlike it, it is restricted to sentence-initial position (1988:18 .). Below it will become clear that our proposal is very similar to Valimaa-Blum's in this respect.
Despite its advantages and sound position in current work, the focus/openproposition articulation is not empirically adequate to cover all possible sentence types. Interestingly, it appears that what this articulation fails to account for, the topic-comment articulation takes care of, and vice versa. Let us consider the same example discussed in reference to topic-comment:
(40) a. She gave the shirt to Harry. (Prince 1986:ex. 1) b. To Harry she gave the shirt.
Sentences (40)a and (40)b, while representing the same logico-semantic proposition, represent two di erent packaging instructions. The topic-comment framework fails to account for the informational split within the comment in, for example, sentence (a), between the shirt and to Harry. It has nothing to say about the fact that the shirt is focal, while to Harry is not. Obviously, the focus/open-proposition framework does have something to say about this split: the shirt is the focus that instantiates the variable in the open-proposition She gave x to Harry, thus capturing the fact that the shirt and Harry belong to two di erent informational units.
Now, there is one further di erence between sentences (a) and (b): the position of the phrase to Harry it is postfocal in (a) but sentence-initial in (b). This di erence is captured by the topic-comment framework, as noted, by saying that to Harry is a topic in (b) but not in (a). In contrast, the focus/open-proposition approach is at a loss here, since from its perspective the two sentences are the same: a focus, a shirt, and an open-proposition, she gave x to Harry. Why is then to Harry preposed in (b)?
This fact has not gone unnoticed. In fact, Valimaa-Blum, as already noted, incorporates an S-topic into her description of information packaging, presumably, because she noticed a gap in the empirical coverage of her OldInfo-NewInfo distinction. Furthermore, there exists a proposal within the focus/open-proposition approach to account for topic preposing in the work of Prince 1981a, Ward 1985, and Ward & Prince 1986. Basically, these authors suggest that topic-initial constructions perform two `discourse functions' or informational tasks: one, marking
51

the sentential focus/open-proposition structure|the packaging instruction in our terms|and, the other, marking the preposed NP as encoding an entity that stands in a particular referential standing with another entity already introduced in the previous linguistic context. In particular, it is argued, drawing on work on linguistic scales by Hirschberg 1985, that the entity encoded in the preposed phrase `must be related, via a salient partially ordered set poset] relation to one or more entities already evoked in the discourse model' (Ward & Prince 1986:4). As will be shown
in x 4.3.2, our proposal indirectly incorporates the main insight of Ward & Prince's
proposal. Summing up the review of the focus/open-proposition articulation, it must be
pointed out that the distinctions it makes are necessary for a complete theory of information packaging. Several problems arise, however, when attempting to de ne the notions involved, especially when using traditional semantic terms like entailment and presupposition. Prince's proposal in terms of salient `shared knowledge', with the understanding that shared knowledge is not really `shared' (it's what the speaker assumes are the hearer's beliefs, in Prince's terms), is unproblematic. A di erent kind of problem, which it shares with the topic-comment approach, is the incompleteness of empirical coverage concerning the existence of sentence-initial preposed elements. Empirically thorough solutions to this void have been proposed (Ward 1985, Ward & Prince 1986, Valimaa-Blum 1988) and will be taken into consideration in our account.
3.1.5 Dominance
One further approach to information packaging is found in Erteschik-Shir 1973, 1979, 1986 and Erteschik-Shir & Lappin 1979, 1983: the notion of `dominance'. Dominance, in contrast to all the approaches seen above, does not come in a bipartite structure, but is rather a discourse property which is assigned to a constituent according to the intentions of the speaker. Dominance is de ned as follows:
DOM: A constituent c, of a sentence S, is dominant in S if and only if the speaker intends to direct the attention of his/her hearer(s) to the intension of c, by uttering S. (Erteschik-Shir & Lappin 1983:420)
52

As noted in x 2.2, in a sense, one of the things the packaging instruction does is
single out the informative part of the sentence, i.e. the focus. One could say, a la Erteschik-Shir, that the speaker directs the hearer's attention to this focus (although it also provides detailed instructions about how to retrieve the information embodied in that focus and enter it into her/his knowledge-store e ciently).
In fact, Erteschik-Shir herself states that `dominance is meant to cover those cases for which focus is generally used' (1986:120), even though she lists two differences between a dominant constituent and a focus. First, she rejects `presupposition' as the complement of dominant constituents. Presupposition, she argues, does not exclude dominance, since presupposed material can be dominant, as in (41) (Erteschik-Shir 1986:ex. 11):
(41) A: John regrets that he quit his job. B: Yes I know. It has been lled and he can't go back.
The italicized portion in (41)A is the dominant constituent of the sentence. But, as complement of regret, the embedded sentence is also presupposed|in the traditional meaning of the word|by (41). Her objection to presupposition, however, is based on a misunderstanding of the sense in which the practitioners of the focuspresupposition framework use the term. As mentioned above, a sentence does not actually presuppose its `presupposition', but the ambiguity of the term has led to this same equivocation in several occasions. And second, she claims that, while focus is de ned in terms of `nuclear stress assignment', in her framework `stress' pattern follows from the assignment of dominance. For most workers in the focusbackground framework, however, including this study, intonational prominence is just one of the structural manifestations of focushood.
For all intents and purposes, then, the dominant constituent is equivalent to the focus of the sentence. Even though Erteschik-Shir's proposal is thorough (she even sets an operational test|the lie test|to determine what constituent is the dominant one in the sentence), her notion of hearer's attention seems less transparent than the notion of information packaging. Since most of the insights gained by the dominance approach are also captured by the focus-background approach, the former is included in the discussion of the latter.
53

3.2 Proposal
In this section an informational articulation meant to incorporate all the insights of the approaches just surveyed, while avoiding their shortcomings, is presented. First, however, we shall provide a global assessment of these previous approaches.
3.2.1 Assessment of Previous Approaches
As noted, there are two kinds of problems with the approaches available in the literature. On the one hand, there are some de nitional problems, especially concerning the notion of topic and the exact nature of the open-proposition. On the other, both articulations|topic-comment and focus/open-proposition|are incapable of accounting for all the possible informational splits of the sentence.
The rst problem will be avoided by staying away from the problematic de nitions. For the open-proposition, which is adopted in our system with the name
of `ground' (cf. x 3.2.2), Prince's analysis in term's of `hearer's knowledge' will be
adapted, avoiding any de nitions of this informational notion in logico-semantic or traditional presuppositional terms. We also adopt a topiclike sentence-initial phrase, under the name of `link', modifying Reinhart's analysis in terms of a `cataloguing address or le card'. By restricting the `link' to be sentence-initial one can elude the problematic extension of topichood to other elements of the sentence. It was with this extension that rendered topichood a nonoperationalizable notion. Finally, the `givenness/newness paradox'|how can the `focus of new information' be discourseold?|is avoided by making clear that referential status is a property of discourse entities and the phrases that encode them and information packaging is a relational property that constituents have by virtue of their standing in a particular relationship with the other element of the sentence.
The second problem, the incompleteness of empirical coverage which both these informational articulations su er from, is due to the fact that a binomial informational division of the sentence is simply not enough. The topic-comment framework cannot account for the informational split within the comment, and the focus/openproposition framework fails to provide an explanation for the existence of sentenceinitial topiclike phrases. This, in fact, has been noticed by several authors in the Praguean tradition (cf. Hajicova 1984) and by Dahl 1974, and, tacitly but clearly by
54

Valimaa-Blum 1988 and Prince & Ward (Prince 1981a, Ward 1985, Ward & Prince 1986).
The Prague School nds a potential solution to this insu ciency in the articulation of the informational structure along a continuum of communicative dynamism that involves notions from the thematic structure of the predicate. In other words, the informational split within the open-proposition|their topic|is accounted for not in informational terms but in terms of a communicative hierarchy of thematic roles that determines word-order changes within the otherwise monolithic Praguetopic of a sentence. Presenting the details of this proposal is impossible here, although it must be pointed out that it violates any autonomy-of-levels hypothesis, since it brings along a direct interaction at the same level between thematic and informational considerations.
Dahl's (1974) position is more germane to the proposal of this study. He suggests that sentences must have two distinct articulations, namely, topic-comment and focus-background (= focus/open-proposition), `if for no other reason because longer sentences may exhibit a tripartite structure' (1974:2). His example of a tripartite structure is (42) (Dahl 1974:ex. 3), in which the narrowest of the possible readings of focus is assumed.
topic comment (42) What does John drink? - John drinks beer.
background focus
His proposal, however, is somewhat redundant in that the two articulations in question partially overlap. The verb drinks, for instance, is both comment and background. While it is indeed necessary to make the distinction between information and ground, it is less clear that it is useful to group the nontopical elements together into an informational primitive. As will be seen below, it is unnecessary to preserve two superordinate informational units (the ground and the comment), since the same empirical ground can be covered with a simpler ontology. One can indeed divide the sentence in (42), for instance, into three parts within one single articulation instead of having Dahl's two redundant partially-overlapping ones, but this is done at the cost of foregoing both the superordinate units, the comment and the background (gt=background-topic, gc=background-comment, fc=focus-comment):
55

(43)

. J| o{hz n} d| ri{nzks} b|e{ezr} gt gc fc

This consequence is too strong in that the distinction focus-ground seems to be a

basic one, since it re ects the core distinction between information and anchoring

material. In order to obtain a tripartite division, and respect at least one of the

superordinate informational units, a hierarchical articulation must be used.

The articulation presented in the next section is a tripartite hierarchical ar-

ticulation that captures the appropriate divisions of both the topic-comment and

the focus-background frameworks while digesting them into one single structure.

This trinomial structure is empirically equivalent to Dahl's parallel articulations

(but see the observations about redundancy above) or Valimaa-Blum's (1988) Old-

Info/NewInfo plus S-topic. The main di erence between our proposal and Valimaa-

Blum's is that the trinomial articulation presented below integrates all the informa-

tional primitives into the purpose of information packaging, unlike Valimaa-Blum's.

In her account the S-topic has an independent existence of its own totally unrelated

to the OldInfo/NewInfo split. It is clear, however, that the S-topic does perform

some speci c task in the accommodation of information (NewInfo) in the hearer's

knowledge-store. The articulation proposed in the next section captures this by

incorporating the S-topic, the link, as part of the ground and giving it a speci c

subtask within the larger information-retrieval task of the ground. Similar comments

about unintegration could be made about Dahl's parallel articulations.

Before moving on to the next section, let us summarize the positive aspects to be

preserved and the negative aspects to be avoided in the approaches to information

packaging reviewed above:

- To be avoided:

nonoperationalizable criteria (for topic) incomplete empirical coverage semantic and (real) presuppositional accounts and nonrelational de nitions (for focus-presupposition) redundant or unintegrated informational articulations
- To be preserved:

56

an optional sentence-initial topiclike expression
the focus-background distinction
3.2.2 Trinomial Hierarchical Articulation
A sound account of information packaging must provide a clear representation of the informational split of the sentence incorporating all the informational units observable. Furthermore, it must describe in detail the combinatorial operations by means of which the informative and the noninformative part of the utterance are put together to yield packaging instructions, and a speci cation of the interpretive rules that lead to their interpretation. This section is devoted to the rst task. Adopting several insights inherited from previous work, the primitives that constitute the informational articulation of the sentence will be established. The description of the combinatorial and interpretive rules that build on these primitives is undertaken in Chapter 4.
It is proposed that the sentence is informationally articulated into a trinomial hierarchical structure consisting of the focus and the ground, while the latter is further subdivided into the link and the tail. This partition is represented in (44):40
(44) Sg=roffuoncdu=sf,lginroku, tnadiglg
It re ects both the focus-background split and the fact that within the ground there often is a `special' topiclike element, the link, which appears in sentenceinitial position. The informational unit `comment' is foregone, since it is rendered unnecesary in the account presented below (cf. Ch. 4).
The focus corresponds exactly to the focus in the frameworks reviewed above (the topic-focus and the focus/open-proposition or focus-background approaches). It constitutes the only informative part of the sentence, as in Halliday 1967, i.e., the segment of the sentence in which all the information is encoded. It is, therefore, the only nonelidable part of the sentence, since it is the only contribution to the
40The hierarchical nature of this representation does not automatically imply continuous constituency. No claim is made with respect to linearization, since, in particular, the two parts of the ground may or may not constitute a linear unit at the surface.
57

hearer's knowledge-store at the time of utterance (or so the speaker assumes). The name focus is preserved due to its widespread use in the American, Hallidayan, and Praguean traditions. Also, the other main use of the term, the AI-focus, appears to be distinct enough to permit the existence of a healthy homonymity. The focus of a sentence is operationally identi ed by context|with the now habitual warnings about givenness/newness|and thanks to its invariably being intonationally prominent.
The ground is the complement of the focus and is equivalent in coverage to the presupposition, the open-proposition, the Prague-topic, or the background in the
approaches reviewed in x 3.1.4. The term `ground' is taken, as a terser version, from
Dahl's (1974) and Chafe's (1976) background, moving away, as many other authors before, from the con ictive term `presupposition', but also from `open-proposition' due to its semantic connotation. The term `ground' is free from any connection to logico-semantic meaning.
The informational force of the ground consists exclusively of acting as a vehicular frame for the informative focus, i.e. it guarantees an appropriate entry of information into the hearer's knowledge-store, indicating to the hearer where and how the information must be entered. Since the focus is the information in the sentence, it follows that the ground does not make any contribution to the hearer's knowledge-store. The knowledge encoded in the ground portion of a communicated proposition is knowledge the speaker assumes that the hearer already possesses. It is also the case, however, that the ground must, in some sense, be `relevant' enough to perform the anchoring task it is assigned, i.e., it is licensed only to guarantee that the information carried by the sentence is entered into the knowledge-store appropriately. If (the speaker assumes) hearers can gure out how the information in the sentence contributes to their knowledge-store, the sentence may not have a ground. The focus is the only nonelidable segment of the sentence and may exist by itself, either as an all-focus sentence or as a sentence-fragment utterance. The ground is divided into the link and the tail, each performing a particular task within the more general anchoring role of the superordinate unit.
The link in this articulation is analogous to the sentence-initial topiclike expression found in some of the theme-rheme and topic-comment approaches discussed in
x 3.1.1 and x 3.1.2. The term `topic' is avoided due to its multiple ambiguity and
58

choosing `theme' to designate the sentence-initial topiclike expression is not any better, owing especially to the use of `theme' and `thematic' in a completely unrelated but central component of linguistic structure.
Moreover, the notion of link does not match one-hundred-percent the `topic' in the topic-comment articulation on which it is based. It does match the topic as originally presented in Mathesius 1915, Hockett 1958, and Halliday 1967, as noted, but it does not incorporate later extensions of topichood to elements other than the sentence-initial topic-announcing phrase, as in Reinhart 1982 and Gundel 1988. The label `link' is used in order to avoid possible misunderstandings in what the term is meant to cover. A notion of `linking up' is found here and there in the literature, as in Travn cek 1962, for instance, where his theme (akin to a Halliday-theme) is described as `the sentence element that links up directly with the object of thought, proceeds from it and opens the sentence thereby' (1962:166).41
The link in the trinomial hierarchical articulation performs precisely this task of `linking up with the object of thought'. This linking-up is expressed by means of a Reinhart-like view of links as designating an address of sorts under which the
oncoming information is classi ed (cf. Reinhart 1982 and x 3.1.2). A link is an
address pointer in the sense that it directs the hearer to a given address (or le card in Reinhart's (1982) or Heim's (1983) terms) in the hearer's knowledge-store, under which the information carried by the sentence is entered. Pointing to this address is part of the information-anchoring role of the ground. By starting a sentence with a link speakers indicate to hearers that the focus must be entered under the address denoted by that link, i.e. that hearers must go to that address (or pull out that le card), and enter the information under its label.
Links, as noted, must be sentence-initial, following the restriction required by, for example, Travn cek 1962 and Halliday 1967. Using the de nition of link as an address pointer, a practical processing reason for their sentential-initialness is automatically obtained, since an address must be pointed to before the information to be entered under it is spelled out. Herring 1990, a crosslinguistic study of topic and focus encoding, states that `languages of all types are consistent in putting
41The term `link' is also used by Fowler 1927 to describe some sentence-initial phrases (Catherine Ball, p.c.). Fowler's use of the term, however, is based on the idea that these phrases constitute a `linking' with the previous discourse, not a `linking with the object of thought'.
59

shifted topics =links] rst' (1990:9).42 If the view that links are address pointers is correct this is not surprising at all. De ning links as address pointers also derives, as Reinhart 1982 does, the aboutness feeling that is central to the topic-comment approach. In contrast with Reinhart, however, in this study aboutness is treated as an epiphenomenon resulting from the very relation of links as address pointers with the informative part of the sentence: if the information is retrieved and entered under a given address, that information will be felt as being about the denotation of that address.
Even though links appear only in sentence-initial position|and this is their main structural characteristic, which can be used as an operational criterion for identi cation|not all sentence-initial elements have to be links. The link is part of the ground and, as noted, the ground exists only if necessary to guarantee a successful retrieval of the information encoded in the sentence. Therefore, linkless sentences are also possible in situations in which the address under which information must be entered is already established or in which, for whatever reason, there is no particular address for the information encoded in the sentence.43
The de nition of links as sentence-initial must be understood as including the case of multiple links. Sentences may have more than one link, as in the Catalan example (45):
(45) El broquil a l`amo l'hi van regalar. the broccoli to the.boss obj.iobj 3p-pst-give Approx.: `The broccoli the boss (they) gave it to him (for free).'
In these cases the speaker directs the hearer to go to two addresses and enter the information under both. The second link in example (45) is not sentence-initial. Instead of having each link be sentence-initial, it should be made clear that it is the link string (link ) that is sentence-initial.
The tail, the last informational primitive, is the complement of the link within the ground. The term `tail' is borrowed from Dik's Functional Grammar theory
42It is clear from Herring's paper that her `shifted topic' is analogous to the link, while her `continuous topics' refer to something akin to a Givon-topic.
43Even though the link points to an entity in the knowledge-store (an address), it is not the case that the link is marking the discourse entity it represents as hearer-old. The fact that the entity must be hearer-old is an artifact of the informational task of the link: in general, an address cannot be pointed at unless it exists already (even though in some cases the creation of an address and the pointing to it can be simultaneous).
60

(1978). Like its synonym `antitopic' (Chafe 1976, Lambrecht 1981), it has been used to describe right-detached constituents, especially in languages like French, but it has never been de ned except by its structural position (cf. Lambrecht 1981 for discussion). The original use by Dik and his associates, however, describes only a subset of tail elements of this proposal. Right-detached constituents, at least in some languages, are indeed part of the tail, but the tail may also be encoded in other positions within the sentence structure as, for instance, in English (see Ch. 5).
Within the vehicular, anchoring informational force of the ground, the tail performs a more speci c task regarding the exact way in which information is retrieved and entered under a given address. It would take us too far a eld to describe the exact mechanics of the tail here. First, the combinatorial rules by means of which the aforementioned informational primitives interact must be introduced. This is done in the next chapter. Pretheoretically, the tail may be viewed as an element that acts as a signalling ag to indicate exactly how the information carried by the sentence must be entered under a given address.
The position of the tail within a sentential structure is not universally constant. While, as noted, both link and focus have some universal structural characteristics (sentence-initialness and intonational prominence, respectively) there is no such correlate in the case of the tail, although it is true that it is never marked with prosodic prominence. Structural properties of each individual language (basic word order, basic intonation contour, verb-secondness, etc.) may determine the position in which tails end up surfacing in a sentence. The tail, therefore, must be negatively identi ed as the nonfocal nonlink part of the sentence, although within each language particular informational/structural correlates should be found. As with links, more than one element may constitute the tail.
3.2.3 Application of the Articulation
Given the trinomial hierarchical articulation presented in (44), repeated here as (46),
(46) Sg=roffuoncdu=sf,lginroku, tnadiglg
and its characteristics, i.e. non-elidability of the focus, optionality of the ground elements and sentence-initialness of the link, one is led to expect four possible in-
61

formational structures for a sentence: link-focus sentences, all-focus sentences, linkfocus-tail sentences, and focus-tail sentences. These expectations are empirically met, as attested by the literature on informational sentence types. In this section, these four informational structures will be illustrated and the correspondences with their equivalents in the literature pointed out.
Link-focus
In this type, the only ground is the link. Hearers are instructed to go to a given address and enter the information of the sentence under that address. The speaker directs the hearer to enter the information by merely adding it under the relevant address. The following are some examples in English and Catalan:44
(47) a. The boss called. b. L'amo F ha trucat ].
(48) a. The boss F visited a broccoli plantation in colombia ]. b. L'amo F va visitar una plantacio de broquil a colombia ].
(49) a. The boss1 F I wouldn't bother t1]. b. L'amo1 F no l1'emprenyaria t1].
(50) a. Broccoli1 the boss F doesn't eat t1]. b. De broquil1 l'amo F no en1 menja t1].
These examples illustrate the two standard cases of link-focus structure, with the link being either the subject in (47) and (48), a preposed complement in (49), and a case of multiple links in (50).
The link-focus structure corresponds to the typical topic-comment articulation
(with a noncomplex comment) of the topic-comment framework (cf. x 3.1.2 above).
It is also equivalent to the categorical judgment in the thetic/categorical distinction of Kuroda 1972 and Sasse 1987. This distinction, originating in the writings of the nineteenth-century philosophers Franz Brentano and Anton Marty, was meant as an alternative to the unique Aristotelian bipartite judgment. Categorical judgments consist of two acts: a naming of an entity and an expression of a statement
44Since the Catalan examples are equivalent to the corresponding English ones, no translation is provided.
62

about it. It corresponds to the traditional Aristotelian judgment and to the topiccomment articulation. Thetic judgments merely express an event or state, and they correspond to our all-focus structure, as will be pointed out below.45
Link-focus sentences are also equivalent to the predicate focus structure of Lambrecht 1987, 1988. He considers it the `unmarked' type of informational structure and de nes it as a structure `in which the subject or a topical non-subject constituent] is the topic, thus in the domain of the pragmatic presupposition, and in which the predicate expresses a Stalnaker-]assertion about this topic' (1988:6). In other words, the entire sentence, except for the link sentence-initial constituent, lies within the scope of his Stalnaker-assertion.
All-focus
All-focus structures correspond to sentences where the ground is null. In such cases, speakers assume that hearers are capable of retrieving the information carried by the sentence without any need for a vehicular anchoring frame: information can be entered into the knowledge-store without the need for an address pointer, and there is no need for a tail to indicate how the information ts under an address. There are two reasons for the existence of linkless sentences: a) the information of the sentence must be entered under a particular address, but the speaker assumes that the hearer knows which one already from context, i.e., does not have to go to it because s/he is already there, or b), no particular address is relevant for the entry of information. A temporary all-purpose `situation address' may be used (cf. Ch. 4).
The following are some examples. They include general descriptions (51), pure existential sentences (52), and sentence fragments (53):
(51) a. F The boss called ]. b. F Ha trucat l'amo ].
45Two points about the thetic/categorical distinction. One, categorical judgments are thought to represent a predication. The topic-comment articulation and our link-focus structures have nothing to do with syntactic or semantic predication. And two, Sasse 1987 explicitly states that `the thetic/categorical distinction is not a matter of information structure, as is often assumed, but can be explained in terms of expectation' (1987:511). It seems clear, though, that `information structure' in his discussion designates referential status of discourse entities and not information packaging. That being the case, his position is in agreement with this study. In fact, his `hearer's expectation' seems analogous to what is called `information' here.
63

(52) a. Waiter! F There's a y in my cream of broccoli soup ]! b. Cambrer! F Tinc una mosca a la crema de broquil ]!
(53) a. What doesn't the boss like? broccoli.
b. Que no li agrada, a l'amo? el broquil.
Some all-focus structures (at least those in (51) and (52)) correspond to Kuno's (1972) neutral descriptions (`sentences that represent nothing but new information' (1972:298)), Schmerling's (1976) news sentences or all-new utterances,46 and other labels like event-reporting sentences (cf. Lambrecht 1987).
In the thetic/categorical distinction, they correspond to the thetic judgment, as de ned above. Sasse 1987 lists the following types of thetic judgments: weather expressions, existence, presence or appearance, description of situations, and in response to a question like `what happened?' (1987:547). Lambrecht 1988 refers to these sentences as sentence-focus structures, `sentences in which the focus domain is the entire sentence' (1988:11), involving no `pragmatically presupposed openproposition'.
Tailful Structures
Both the link-focus-tail and the focus-tail structures are included here. The tail, as noted, is an indication that further instructions are needed to guarantee the felicitous entry of information under a given address. The following are examples of link-focus-tail structure (54) and focus-tail structure (55). The tail in these examples is the material following the focus:
(54) a. The boss hates broccoli. b. L'amo l1'odia, el broquil1.

Both the link-focus-tail and the focus-tail structures correspond to Prince's (1981a,
1986) focus/open-proposition sentences (cf. x 3.1.4).47 These sentences have also
been referred to as `narrow focus', `constituent focus', or `contrastive focus' sentences by many of the workers in the focus/open-proposition framework. In fact, for nonlinguistic historical reasons, the unmodi ed term `focus' is understood many a time as referring exclusively to the focus in tailful sentences, i.e. narrow focus.
Having introduced, de ned, and illustrated the informational primitives that constitute the informational articulation of the sentence, we are now ready to discuss how these are combined into packaging instructions and what the interpretation of each of the di erent packaging instructions is. This is the subject of the next chapter.
47A subset of the sentences Prince discusses under this rubric are treated as link-focus structures (e.g. Beer I like). This discrepancy is actually an artifact of the way in which the tail is analyzed.

Chapter 4 A Theory of Informatics

In x 2.2 information packaging was characterized as a non-logico-semantic type of
sentence `meaning' concerned with the retrieval of information and its entry into the
hearer's knowledge-store. Information packaging was de ned as in (57) (=(11)):

(57)

information packaging: A small set of instructions with

which the hearer is instructed by the speaker to retrieve

the information carried by the sentence and enter it

into her/his knowledge-store.

where information is de ned as that part of the propositional content which constitutes a contribution of knowledge to the hearer's knowledge-store. These instructions are meant to optimize the update of the hearer's knowledge-store by singling out the informative part of the sentence and articulating the ground in such a way as to indicate how this information ts the hearer's knowledge-store.
It was already pointed out in Ch. 2 that information packaging is su ciently distinct from other types of pragmatic understanding to grant it autonomous status and, despite its close coexistence with logico-semantic meaning within the interpretive end of language, they also remain independent.48 Therefore, it was suggested that the generation and interpretation of information packaging must be dealt with in an autonomous module, i.e. informatics.
This chapter provides an account of the exact nature of the role of informatics in the larger language apparatus. If building a coherent and comprehensive theory

48As noted in Ch. 1 this belief is not universally held, and proposals that try to reduce information packaging to logico-semantic meaning exist, as well as proposals that, despite recognizing a di erence between the two, require the presence of informational elements in the logico-semantic representation. These proposals are addressed in Ch. 7.

66

of informatics independent of these other interpretive modules proves feasible, it
constitutes indirect validation of the autonomy hypothesis assumed. This account
is based on the informational primitives discussed in x 3.2.2. It describes the means
by which this primitives interact to yield the information-packaging intructions and
the exact interpretation of these instructions.

4.1 The Role of Informatics
4.1.1 The Knowledge-store
The de nition of information-packaging presented in Ch. 2 presupposes the existence of a hearer's knowledge-store with a given structure. In order to be able to describe the role of information-packaging in language understanding, it will be necessary rst to discuss how the hearer's knowledge-store might be structured. To this purpose, the le metaphor in Heim's File Change Semantics (Heim 1983) will be adapted.
Heim views discourse referents as le cards in a le. Before the beginning of a discourse the hearer has a le with zero le cards (F0). As the discourse progresses le cards are added and updated. For instance, after the utterance of (58), the hearer puts the cards (59) in her/his le (ignoring the speaker's own le card):

(58) Pat told me a weird story today.

addr.: pat (59) told z to
speaker (pat)

addr.: story(z) weird(z) told by pat(z)

In Heim's terms, the hearer has gone from an F0 to a given F1. As the discourse continues, every utterance will cause a change of les from Fn to Fn+1. Given the following three-utterance continuation to the discourse started with (58), the hearer's F4 will contain the le cards and the entries in (61) (ignoring the le card for `a story'):
(60) She saw this man with a broccoli stalk. Well, the guy starts munching on it, and, lo and behold, he's arrested right away.
67

addr.: pat told z to (61) speaker (pat) saw x(pat)

addr.: man(x) seen by pat(x) has y(x) munch on y(x) arrested(x)

addr.: br. stalk(y) had by (x y) munched on by x(y)

File F4 has three cards which list all the attributes and relations between them speci ed by the propositional content of the sentences in (58) and (60). The le change from F1 to F4 involved the update of Pat's le card and the addition of cards for the man and the broccoli stalk and their update.
Heim's le, as pointed out in x 2.3.3, is akin to the notion of discourse model
viewed as a mental representation of the entities involved in a discourse and their attributes and the links between them. For our purposes here, however, Heim's le metaphor will be applied to the hearer's knowledge-store. The knowledge-store is taken to be a large le with a number of le cards or addresses. Each address denotes an entity and under each address there are a number of entries specifying attributes and relations pertaining to that entity. Unlike in Heim's, there is no le F0 before the beginning of a discourse, since the hearer's knowledge is not null at the start of an interaction, i.e., at the start of a discourse the knowledge-store contains addresses denoting hearer-old discourse-new (`unused') entities. So, for instance, in (58) the hearer would not add a le card `Pat' because it would already be there from previous shared knowledge.
How is the knowledge-store modi ed and updated? The referential status of entities (cf. 2.3.2) plays a crucial role in this process. According to Heim and others, an inde nite NP will cause the hearer to start a new le card or create a new address and a de nite NP will indicate that an already-existing address must be activated. In example (60) above, the inde nites this man and a broccoli stalk instruct the hearer to create a new address and the pronominal forms she, he, and it indicate that the address they denote has been already created.49 The relations and attributes that
49Actually, to be exact, there is a further di erence between de nites in general and pronouns in particular. Both denote preexistent addresses but di er in that pronouns denote salient preexistent addresses (cf. Chafe 1976, Prince 1988b) and other de nites nonsalient ones. In other words, de nites trigger an activation of a dormant preexistent address. Pronouns simply indicate that their referent is in activation at the time of utterance.

68

make up the propositional content of the utterances in (60) are then entered under each one of the addresses involved in those utterances. In (61), the address for `man' contains the knowledge that he was munching on a broccoli stalk and the address for `broccoli stalk' contains the knowledge that it was being munched on by the man. This re ects the fact that, after the discourse in (60), one knows a) about the broccoli stalk that it was munched on, and b) about the man that he was munching on a broccoli stalk.
The role of referential status marking in language understanding, then, is the management of addresses in the hearer's knowledge-store: creation and activation of addresses or le cards. This is not only the view in Heim 1983 and Prince 1988b, for instance, but it agrees with the observation made repeatedly in the literature
(cf. x 2.3.2 above) that referential status is a property of NPs and/or referents
independent of the sentential context in which they occur. This schematic view of the knowledge-store will be enough to allow a description
of the role of information packaging. Information packaging is concerned precisely with the update of the knowledge-store only with respect to the entry of information. In other words, while referential status marking is responsible for the creation of new addresses or activation of existing addresses, information packaging is responsible for the actual update of these addresses. It indicates what part of the utterance constitutes information and, furthermore, it shows where this information goes and how it ts under a particular address. This will be discussed in what follows.
4.1.2 Redundancy in the Entry of Data
In spite of its advantages and intuitive appeal, the le metaphor has an important drawback: its ine ciency. This ine ciency is due to two charateristics of the le metaphor: a) it does not take into account the knowledge already existent in the le, and b) it requires multiple entry of the same propositional content. Let us discuss them in this order.
Preexistent Knowledge
Suppose a speaker has just uttered sentence (62)a with the propositional content in (62)b.
69

(62) a. The boss hated the salty broccoli quiche. b. hated (the salty broccoli quiche, the boss)

Referential-status marking indicates, in this case, that no addresses need be created, only that two already-existing addresses, `the boss' and `the salty broccoli quiche', must be activated. Then the hearer must perform her/his ling task and must enter this data into her/his knowledge-store. After this task is performed, a partial view of the hearer's knowledge-store may be represented as in (63):

addr.: boss(x)

addr.: br. quiche(y)

(63) hated y(x)

salty(y) hated by (x y)

There are two addresses, one for `the boss' and one for `the broccoli quiche', and

under each of them the relevant attributes, i.e. that the quiche was salty, and the

relations that hold between the two addresses, i.e. that the boss hated the quiche

and that the quiche was hated by the boss, are recorded.
Returning to the two hypothetical hearers H1 and H2 introduced in x 2.2, let us

again assume that H1 knows nothing about the existence of a connection between the

boss and the broccoli quiche and that H2 knows of the existence of such a connection

but does not know which one it is. The following is what their knowledge-store might

look like before proposition (62) is communicated, (64) for H1 and (65) for H2:

(64) H1:

addr.: boss(x)

addr.: br. quiche(y)

salty(y)

(65) H2: addr.: boss(x)
y(x)

addr.: br. quiche(y) salty(y)
by (x y)

The di erence in what H1 and H2 know is represented in the di erence between the content of the le cards in (64) and (65). In (64) there is no information about the
70

connection between the boss and broccoli, but in the case of (65), both the knowledge of the connection and the fact that the nature of this connection is unknown must be represented. This is done by means of the blank ( ).
Within the le metaphor, however, there is no way to take this di erence into account. Propositional content is entered in the same way independent of what the hearer may or may not already know. This process is not very e cient given that some of the entry of data in the case of H2, for instance, is totally redundant and unnecessary. What is needed to avoid the redundant entry of data is the notion of information. A view of data entry in terms of propositional content does not allow us to take into account the distinction between H1's knowledge-store and H2's knowledge-store. Information does, since it is de ned precisely with respect to the hearer's knowledge-store. As noted above, it is information that is responsible for the di erent structural encodings of the proposition in (62) when addressing H1, shown in (66)a, or when addressing H2, shown in (66)b:
(66) a. The boss hated F the salty broccoli quiche ]. b. The boss hated the salty broccoli quiche.
Speakers are sensitive to the di erent make-ups of di erent hearers' knowledgestores and package the proposition they want to communicate in di erent packaging instructions accordingly. Even though the propositional content of (66)a-b is the same, the information they carry is di erent. The marking of information allows for a more e cient process of data entry, since the hearer need not re-record knowledge s/he already has.
Multiple Entry
In the discussion around the discourse in (60) it was pointed out that in Heim's approach|and indeed in any other discourse model account|the propositional content encoded in a given sentence is recorded on every le card whose referent is evoked in the discourse. Under the address for `man', for instance, it was entered that he was munching on a broccoli stalk, and under `broccoli stalk' it was entered that it was being munched on by a man. This means that the same knowledge is entered into the hearer's knowledge-store twice or more depending on how many participants are involved in a given utterance. The updating of the hearer's knowledge-store after sentence (67),
71

(67) The boss gave Mary a broccoli stalk.
would require that the same propositional content be entered three times, one for each address involved in the sentence.50 As noted, this seems to be a necessary process to guarantee that all the knowledge one has about a given entity is available when evoking that entity.
There is, however, another way to achieve the same results. The traditional le metaphor is based on a now `old-fashioned' ling system. Let us consider the following example: in 1950 Smith's Body Shop from Anytown, a new customer, purchased 25 alternators from Jones Auto Parts. Mrs. Jones kept a customer le, where she kept track of their purchases, a stock le, where she kept track of the inventory, and a third le containing le cards for each city in her business area, where she listed all customers from that city. After Smith's purchase Mrs. Jones had to update three le cards. She had to create a le card for Smith's Body Shop and enter that he had purchased 25 alternators, update the `alternator' card by registering Smith's purchase and subtracting 25 alternators from the stock, and update the `Anytown' card by adding Smith's Body Shop to the list of customers in Anytown. This process is parallel to the process assumed to take place in the entry of data into the hearer's knowledge-store from the perspective of a traditional le metaphor.
Suppose now the same purchase takes place in 1990. Mrs. Jones abandoned her les and acquired a computer where she still keeps track of the same data. After Smith's purchase, Mrs. Jones enters the following data into her database: Smith's Body Shop from Anytown, 25 alternators. She only enters the data once, probably under the `Smith's Body Shop' card, but if she wants to check her stock, she can call up the `alternator' card and will nd that the sale of 25 alternators to Smith's Body Shop has been registered there too, and if she wants to see which customers she has in Anytown, she may call up the `Anytown' card and Smith's Body Shop will be there.
This, of course, is how any current database or hypercard program works. It is clearly less costly and it achieves the same results. This hypercard e ciency can be applied to the le-structured knowledge-store quite straightforwardly. Let us
50Independently, the hearer is instructed here, via referential-status marking, to activate the preexistent addresses `the boss' and `Mary' and create a new address for `a broccoli stalk'.
72

consider sentence (67) again. The updating of the hearer's knowledge-store need not require that the data be entered three times. It may be entered only under, let us say, `the boss' and is then made available somehow to the other two addresses corresponding to the other participants in the sentence. This availability may be achieved in two ways. The data may be entered under the other addresses at a later stage, or the other addresses may get a crossreference index corresponding to the address `John' through which the relevant knowledge stored under `John' becomes accessible. The second option is chosen for expository purposes, but the implications of each option are left unexplored:
addr. 153: boss(x) addr. 212: mary addr. 10007: br. stalk(y)

(68) gave Mary a br. stalk(x)

cf. 153]

cf. 153]

The information-packaging articulation of the sentence is also responsible for the entry of data in this hypercard fashion, thus avoiding the redundancy that would otherwise arise. As noted, a packaging instruction does not merely signal what the information of the sentence is, it further speci es how this information contributes to the hearer's knowledge. This is the role played by the ground, with speci c subtasks for both the link and the tail. First, given a certain information, where in her/his knowledge-store must the hearer enter it? Taking the discussion above into account, it is proposed that the particular task of the link as an address-pointer is to `point to' the address in the hearer's knowledge-store under which information is entered. In example (67) the boss is the link. This means that the address `the boss' in the hearer's knowledge-store is designated as the address under which the oncoming information of the sentence must be entered. This avoids the need for multiple entry under several addresses, thus improving in e ciency the necessary task of knowledge-store update.
Second, there are cases where knowledge communicated to the hearer in a given proposition partially overlaps with knowledge already present in the hearer's knowledge-store. Without the notion of information, the entry of propositional content becomes redundant in this respect as well. The ground, and speci cally the tail, allows the hearer to relate the information in the sentence with the relevant knowledge already present in her/his knowledge-store in the way to be detailed below.

73

This potential second source of ine ciency is avoided as well, thanks to information packaging.
4.1.3 Information Packaging as Data Entry
Information packaging must be viewed then as being responsible for the entry of data into the hearer's knowledge-store. If propositional content were entered into the hearer's knowledge-store without any further articulation, as in the traditional le metaphor, the result would be a very ine cient system of data-entry. The role of information packaging is to achieve an e cient and nonredundant update of the hearer's knowledge-store. By representing not only propositional content but also information, natural language improves the overall e ciency of the process of communication.
The role of informatics as a linguistic component, then, is to generate and interpret packaging instructions. Structuring sentences into information-packaging intructions is as fundamental a part of language production as encoding propositional content in sentence structure, and interpreting these instructions is as important as decoding propositional content. Information is superimposed on or represented in parallel with propositional content. The interpretation of both types of `meaning' must remain independent. The propositional content of a sentence represents knowledge that speakers have and wish to communicate to hearers. This knowledge speakers have is, in principle, de nable independently of the hearer that will bene t from receiving it. Information is a re ection of the speaker's assumptions about the hearer's knowledge-store. When speakers wish to communicate a proposition they take into account how much of the knowledge represented in that proposition will actually contribute something to the hearer's knowledge-store. Information packaging is crucially a ected by the linguistic context by virtue of this dependence on the speaker's assumptions about the hearer's knowledge and attentional state, but propositional content is constant across speaker-hearer interactions.
Information is a notion relevant for the entry of data into the heare's knowledgestore. What is entered in the knowledge-store is information what is in the knowledge-store is knowledge. In other words, the knowledge-store contains knowledge but receives information. The speaker's knowledge must be `squeezed' into informa-
74

tion in order to be transferred to the hearer's knowledge-store. Squeezing propositions into instructions increases the e cency of the transfer by avoiding all redundancy in the process of data entry into the hearer's knowledge-store. Informatics, then, is not concerned with the interpretation or the representation of meaning in the sentential structure, but with the interpretation and representation of information for the purposes of data entry into the knowledge-store.
Having stated what the exact role of informatics is within the larger task of language production and understanding, let us now proceed to a description of the manner in which this role is carried out by discussing the elements of the theory.
4.2 Elements of the Theory
4.2.1 Primitives
The primitives of the theory and their hierarchical con guration were introduced
and discussed in x 3.2.2. It is the trinomial hierarchical articulation in (69) (=(44)):
(69) Sg=roffuoncdu=sf,lginroku, tnadiglg
This articulation is based on the insights of the proposals previously made in the literature. In particular, it re ects both the focus-ground split (i.e. focuspresupposition, focus/open-proposition, or focus-background) and the fact that within the ground there generally is a `special' topiclike element, the link, which appears in sentence-initial position (analogous, with the provisos noted in Ch. 3, to the topic in the topic-comment framework or the theme in the theme-rheme approach).
These primitives and their arrangement in a given sentence make up the information-packaging instruction represented by that sentence. The instruction is the central object in the informatics, much in the same way the proposition is the central object in the semantics. In order to represent these packaging instructions, we will need to introduce some notation. The notation used may resemble on some occasions the language used in representing logico-semantic meaning. It must be emphasized, though, that the instructions spelled out in this manner evidently do not represent logico-semantic meaning but information packaging. Any similarity between the two is, therefore, purely notational.
75

Before starting the discussion of the di erent instructions that can be construed with these atomic primitives, one notational detail must be introduced. Information packaging, as noted, is concerned with the representation of information and the directions needed to enter that information into the hearer's knowledge-store. It was also noted that every uttered sentence must provide some information since otherwise there is no raison d'^etre for the sentence to exist in normal communication.
Let us represent the (variable amount of) information that all sentences must provide as in (70):
(70) information ]
The symbol (capital phi) stands for an informational one-place operator. It will be called `focus operator'. Everything within its scope (the clause) is informative, i.e., the scope of constitutes all the information provided by the sentence. Given that packaging instructions are a speaker-designed information-retrieval mechanism for the hearer, the operator may be read procedurally as `retrieve', and the instruction in (70) as `retrieve information', whatever the value of this information may be.
The structure in (70) is the simplest of information-packaging instructions, where an entire sentence is information, corresponding to the all-focus sentences seen in
x 3.2.3. Many times, however, not all of the sentence is information: a ground is li-
censed to indicate how the information must be entered into the hearer's knowledgestore. Sentences with a ground correspond to the link-focus, link-focus-tail, and
focus-tail structures discussed in x 3.2.3. Let us now turn to the structure of these
more complex instructions.
4.2.2 Packaging Instructions and Interpretation
The information carried by the sentence is encoded by the focus constituent, even though its informational force is a relational property crucially dependent on its relation with the ground. This means that the focus will always be within the scope of , but, as will be seen in a moment, the focus, strictly speaking, is not all there can be within the scope of . The ground, in contrast, is not information, its only informational force being to permit the appropriate entry of information into the hearer's knowledge-store. Therefore, it cannot appear within the scope of .
76

Let us start by looking at the informational value of links. Links, as part of
the ground, play the anchoring role in the instruction. It was noted in x 3.2.2 that
the link was an address pointer of sorts. In the previous section, it was concluded that links point toward the address in the hearer's knowledge-store under which the information of the sentence must be entered. It instructs hearers to `go to' the address it denotes in their knowledge-store and then enter the information provided by the sentence under that address. Links, therefore, are informationally interpreted as a bipartite element: the instruction `go to' and the address hearers are instructed to go to.
This interpretation may be represented with a quanti er-like element that will be called (capital lambda): x is read `go to x' and the address denoted by the link constitutes the range of x. The representation of the link is, then, as in (71)a (for an address ), while (71)b is the representation of the link expression the boss in the link-focus sentence The boss called, which is read `go to address `the boss' ':
(71) a. = x x . b. x x =the boss.
The fact that the information of the sentence is to be entered under the address denoted by the link is represented by the latter taking scope over this information. The informational task of the link|pointing to a given address|is independent of the referential status of the NP that acts as link. A de nite NP instructs the hearer to activate a preexisting address whether the NP is a link or not. But only if it is a link will the hearer be instructed to go to that address and enter information under it. Links tend to be de nite NPs becuase, as a default, the speaker cannot point to an address in the hearer's knowledge-store if that address is not there already. It is not impossible, however, to instruct the hearer to create an address and to point to that address simultaneously. This is the case in sentences where the link is an inde nite NP. The exact way in which the link takes scope over the information of the sentence will be discussed further after the notation for focus is introduced.
The focus, which must be entirely within the scope of , will be represented by simply writing it in boldface within that scope. The actual formalization of an allfocus sentence, therefore, will not be as in (70) above, but as in (72)a. A particular instantiation of this instruction, for the all-focus sentence F The boss called ] is (72)b:
77

(72) a. focus ] b. the boss called ]
Taking this into account, a link-focus sentence may be represented in the following manner. The link's relation to the information of the sentence is represented through a quanti er-variable structure, i.e. the quanti er binds a variable in the clause, as shown in (73)a. In (73)b, this abstract instruction is illustrated with the particular instruction for the link-focus sentence The boss called:

(73) a. = x x

x focus ]]

b. x x =the boss x called ]]

The instruction in (73) is the instruction encoded in all link-focus sentences. It combines the interpretation of the link with the interpretation of the focus operator. From a speaker's point of view, it may be procedurally read as follows: `I instruct you to go to address in your knowledge-store and then retrieve the information
of the sentence by adding focus under .' Or, in the case of (73)b, `I instruct
you to go to the address \the boss" in your knowledge-store and then retrieve the information of the sentence by adding under \the boss" that he called.' It is clear now why it was noted that the focus is not all that stays within the scope of the variable bound by the link-operator is also found within that scope. As will be seen below, the fact that this variable bound by the link remains within the scope of is actually quite important for the interpretation of information packaging.
Finally, the notation for the tail must be introduced. The tail, being part of the ground, must escape the scope of . This may be represented by abstracting the tail away from the clause, leaving a variable behind within the scope of . This `abstraction' will be represented by means of a lambda-like construct. The graph will be borrowed from the lambda-calculus used in logical semantics. Again, it must be pointed out that all that is borrowed is the symbol, but none of the semantics of the lambda-calculus. The notation for tails is illustrated in (74) for a given tail :

(74) x focus x]] ( )

The tail's task, as noted above, is to further specify how the information must be entered under a given address. If the ground contains a tail it means that the information of the sentence cannot be simply added under the address denoted by the

78

link. Instead, it indicates that part of the proposition communicated is knowledge already contained under that address and that the information of the sentence must be construed in some way with that knowledge instead of merely added.
But how exactly does the presence of a tail a ect the nature of the packaging instruction? The operator instructs the hearer to retrieve the information contained in its scope, but in the discussion on the representation of link-focus sentences, the
operator was read as `retrieve information by adding focus'. This is because the operator actually comes in two brands: `retrieve information by adding focus' and `retrieve information by substituting focus for the blank in the ground \link
tail" (which is already under the address denoted by the link)'. These may be abbreviated as `retrieve-add' and `retrieve-substitute'. What the presence of the tail does in a given packaging instruction is alter the nature of , turning it from a `retrieve-add' to a `retrieve-substitute'.
Let us see this by comparing the link-focus sentence in (75) with the link-focustail one in (76). The (b) examples are the representations of the packaging instruction they encode (instruction (76) represents both the link-operator and the tail in one instruction):

(75)

a. b.

The boss x1, x1 =

Fthheabteosssbroccxo1 lhia]t.es

broccoli

]]

(76) a. The boss hates broccoli.
b. x1, x1 = the boss x2 x1 hates x2 ]] (broccoli)
Both (75) and (76) have the same link. The representation of the link is, therefore, identical in both sentences, and can be read as `I instruct you to go to the address \the boss" and then: : : ' Once the address denoted by the link is `gone to', the hearer is in a position to retrieve the information provided by the sentence, at least in the case of (75). In the case of (76), the hearer needs to know more about the way in which the information must be entered.
This di erence is re ected in the distinction between `retrieve-add' and `retrievesubstitute'. In (75), the instruction continues `: : : and then retrieve the information of the sentence by adding under \the boss" that he hates broccoli'. In the tailful (76), the instruction continues `: : : and then retrieve the information of the sentence by substituting hates for the blank in he broccoli, which is already under \the

79

boss" '. In other words, in (75) the information `hates broccoli' is merely added under `the boss', while in (76) the information `hates' is taken to ll the gap in the knowledge already existent under `the boss', since under this address there is already an entry for ` broccoli'. This lling of the gap is represented by the tail's triggering of the retrieve-substitute brand of . The tail, then, in the fashion discussed above, prevents the hearer from redundantly treating part of the proposition communicated by the hearer as information. A tailful instruction directs the hearer to some entry under a given address and indicates that the focus completes or alters in some way that entry.
The previous discussion shows how informational primitives interact and combine to form packaging instructions. The number of possible packaging instructions totals
four, corresponding to the four informational articulations discussed in x 3.2.3. The
following is a list of the four possible informational articulations of a sentence and the packaging instructions associated with them. Their interpretation is discussed in detail immediately below:
1. Link-focus: x1, x1 = x1 focus ]]
2. All-focus: focus ]

The basic constant informational operator is the one-place , which takes scope over the clause. In the informatics, every sentence is interpreted as having the minimal structure ` information ]', i.e., it is interpreted as `retrieve the information carried by the sentence'. This is a mere representation of the fact that all sentences must carry information. More complex instructions are derived from this basic skeleton. Their purpose, as noted above, is to assure a nonredundant entry of information into the hearer's knowledge-store.
All-focus sentences represent the simplest of instructions, their structure being identical to the basic skeleton ` information ]'. The information in the sentence is carried by the entire structure, i.e., the focus is the entire sentence. This was represented as in (77):
80

(77) focus ]

The following sentences are the examples of all-focus structure that were seen in
x 3.2.3, and (c) represents the instruction each sentence encodes):

(78) a. F The boss called ].

b. c.

F

Ha trucat
the boss

l'amo ].
called ]

(79) a. Waiter! F There's a y in my cream of broccoli soup ]!

b. c.

Cam(tbhreerr!e'sF)Taincyunina

mosca a la crema de broquil ]!
my cream of broccoli soup

]

(80) a. What doesn't the boss like? broccoli.
b. Que no li agrada, a l'amo? el broquil.
c. broccoli ]

Their interpretation is as follows. Sentence (78), already seen in (72), is interpreted in the following terms (from a hearer's point of view): `I am instructed to retrieve the information of the sentence by adding to my knowledge-store that the boss called'. Similarly, in (79), the waiter informationally interprets the sentence as `I am instructed to retrieve the information of the sentence by adding to my knowledgestore that there is a y in the speaker's soup'. Basically, what this instruction says is that the entire propositional content is a contribution of knowledge to the knowledgestore, i.e., that the information of the sentence is equivalent to its propositional content. Sentence (80) is of a di erent kind and will be discussed in a moment.
The linkless sentences just discussed are peculiar in that no particular address in the hearer's knowledge-store is speci ed for the subsequent entry of information. These all-focus sentences have been described as portraying a state of a airs or event (cf. e.g. Sasse 1987), i.e., contrary to link-focus sentences, all-focus sentences are not `about' a speci c entity. This intuition is captured by having the information of the sentence be entered under a temporary or situation address. The contents of this situation address are not meant to be permanent the way the content of regular addresses is. Before the contents of the situation address are deleted they are transferred to the addresses of the entities that participate in the discourse by means of the mechanisms described in the previous sections.

81

The link indicates that information must be entered under the address denoted
by the link. Links are interpreted as `go to address x (the range of x being deter-
mined by the denotation of the link phrase) and under x '. The following are the
interpretations for some of the sentences in x3.2.3 (the example The boss called
has been discussed already):

(81) a. The boss F visited a broccoli plantation in colombia ].

b. c.

L'amo F x1, x1=

b. c.

L'amo1 F no x1, x1= the

lb'eomssprenIyawroiualdt1n].'t

x1]]

A hearer interprets the instruction encoded in (81) as `I am instructed to go to the address \the boss" and then retrieve the information of the sentence by adding under \the boss" that he visited a broccoli plantation in Colombia', and the one encoded in (82) as `I am instructed to go to the address \the boss" and then retrieve the information of the sentence by adding under \the boss" that the speaker wouldn't bother him'.51
The discussion around example (76) showed already how tailful sentences are interpreted, but they will be reviewed here as well for the sake of completion. While the presence of a link indicates that information must be entered under a given address, the presence of a tail indicates that, under the address denoted by the link, the information lls a gap in some partial entry instead of being a mere addition. This property of tails was captured by saying that it alters the nature of from a `retrieve-add' to a `retrieve-substitute'. Let us illustrate this with the following examples:

(83) a. The boss hates broccoli.

b. L'amo l'odia, el broquil.

c. x1, x1 = the boss x2

hates x1

]] ( ) x2

broccoli

51In the sentence representing this instruction there is a subject pronoun I which is not part of the focus, but still appears within the scope of . The role of pronouns in information packaging will be discussed in x 4.3.3 below.

82

(84) a. I can't believe this! The boss is going crazy! broccoli, he wants now.
b. No m'ho hagues cregut mai! L'amo esta ben boig! broquil, vol ara.
c. x1 he x1broccoli ] (wants)
Sentence (83), as mentioned, is interpreted as `I am instructed to go to the address \the boss" and then retrieve the information of the sentence by substituting hates for the blank in the boss broccoli which is already under \the boss" '. `Hates' is not merely added, but substituted for the gap in the entry ` broccoli(x)' under boss(x). This is what distinguishes (83) from its corresponding tailless sentence.
Example (84), in contrast, has no link, since it is assumed that the hearer is already at the address under which information must be entered. As noted, links are pointers. They are only necessary if the hearer needs to go to a given address to enter the information of the sentence under that address. At the time a sentence Sn is uttered, the hearer is located at a given address a, under which s/he was entering the information of sentence Sn;1. If Sn is a linkful sentence, the hearer is instructed to move to another address b before proceeding to enter the information carried by Sn. However, if the information in Sn is to be entered under a, there is no need to instruct the hearer to move to a di erent address, since s/he is currently at a already. Therefore, the presence of a link is unnecessary in Sn, which will be a linkless sentence.
Therefore, the hearer would interpret the instruction of sentence (84) as `I am
instructed to retrieve the information of the sentence by substituting broccoli for
the blank in he wants under the current address.' Example (80), the all-focus sentence fragment seen above, is parallel to (84) in that a link is rendered unnecessary. But, in addition, (80) requires no tail either, since (the speaker assumes) the hearer needs no ground at all to enter the infromation of the sentence appropriately. The instruction encoded in (80) is then `I am instructed to retrieve the information
of the sentence (fragment) by adding broccoli under the current address'.52
The instruction interpretations discussed in this section have been spelled out in a rather cumbersome way. For convenience, the following shorthand notation will also be used:
52What gets added is not actually `broccoli' but `x1 xv broccoli', where the free variables are independently identi able. See x 4.3.3 and x 5.3 for discussion.

The account of informatics presented in this chapter explains how from the informational articulation of the sentence, encoded by syntactic and prosodic means, one may derive the packaging instructions that indicate to hearers what the information of the sentence is. The four instructions proposed are derived in a systematic way from the informational primitives of the sentence. Moreover, these four instructions seem to cover most, if not all, the informational articulations described in the literature. In the remainder of this chapter, some further features of this theory of informatics will be discussed.
4.3 Features of the Theory
4.3.1 Motivation
The account of informatics presented in the previous section is empirically based on
the informational primitives identi ed in the literature as revised above in x 3.2. It is
further validated by its wide coverage, attained with only a very small set of instructions. Nevertheless, there are other motivations, both empirical and conceptual, for the particular representations chosen. These further motivations are discussed in this section.
One of the features of the theory is the representation of links as informational quanti ers in quanti er-variable structures. There is an additional clear empirical motivation for viewing links as quanti er-variable structures. Links, given their informational task, are inherently sentence-initial. Now, if the link phrase is a complement or an adjunct|or a subject in a VS language|it must move from its postverbal thematic position to the sentence-initial slot leaving a gap behind. The result is clearly a surface con guration where the link c-commands the clause and binds its trace. This syntactic con guration, is matched, in the informatics, by a
84

quanti er-variable structure where the link-operator takes scope over the clause and binds a variable in it.
A putative exception to this syntactic con guration is the case of the subject in languages with basic SV order. Subjects in English, for instance, tend to be interpreted as links, given their default existential force (cf. Horn 1989), but there is no movement and trace-binding structure to represent it. In the last few years, however, a number of proposals for both Romance and Germanic languages have appeared that suggest that the surface sentence-initial position of the subject is a derived one.53 If these proposals are correct, even preverbal subjects would t the pattern. In any event, the quanti er-variable structure in the informatics matches a generalized XP1-t1 structure in the syntax.
In packaging instructions, tails, like links, are removed from the scope of to re ect the fact that they are part of the ground and, therefore, not informative. This characteristic of tails was formalized by abstracting the tail phrase from the scope of . It is interesting that in several languages, including Catalan, French and Italian, the phrases that make up the tail are found in a derived position as well. Thus, in these languages, tail phrases are removed from the clause by means of a right-detachment, as in Catalan (85) (=(4) in Ch. 1) and Italian (86) (the (b) sentences are the corresponding canonicals):
(85) a. L'amo l1' odia t1, el broquil1. the.boss obj 3s-hate the broccoli `The boss hates broccoli.'
b. L'amo odia el broquil.
(86) a. Il capo li1 odia t1, i broccoli1. the boss obj 3s-hate the broccoli `The boss hates brocccoli.'
b. Il capo odia i broccoli.
The presence of the clitic object pronominals (l1 and li1) in the (a) sentences reveals that the tail phrases, coindexed with these clitics, are not in their base positions,
53Cf. Fukui & Speas 1986, Kroch, Heycock & Santorini 1988, Bonet 1988, Fernandez-Soriano 1989, Santorini 1989. We will return to this issue in Chs. 5 and 6. All preverbal subjects in Catalan are interpreted as links, but that is not the case in English. Most are, but some are not, as in the case of F The BOSS called ] (cf. the `ambiguity' of subjects with regard to their existential force of lack thereof Horn 1989 suggests that the former are topics and the latter are not).
85

since cooccurrence of clitic and argument is otherwise illicit. In this respect, Catalan and Italian di er from English.
As a result of detaching both links and tails from the clause, the core clause is left, at the surface, containing only the focus of the sentence. In other words, these languages seem to re ect information packaging in a much more salient way than, for example, English, involving not only prosody but the syntax in the process. The informational representation of sentences proposed in the previous chapter re ects closely these structural operations performed in Catalan and Italian, with respect to both links and tails.
A di erent kind of empirical motivation comes from the fact that with the representation proposed above, one is able to re ect the relational nature of informational
properties without any need for stipulation. As pointed out in x 4.2.2, the focus is
not all there is within the scope of the focus operator . This is indeed the case in all-focus sentences, but as soon as there is a ground, one or more variables are found with the focus within the clause, bound by either the link-operator or the tail's -like operator. Let us illustrate this with the by now familiar instruction in (87):

(87) a. The boss hates broccoli.

b. c.

L'amo l1'odia t1, el x1, x1 = the boss

broquil1.
x2 x1

hates

x2

]]

( ) broccoli

The presence of these variables within the scope of , i.e. within the information of

the sentence, is not accidental. The clause portion in the instruction (87)c,

(88) x1 hates x2 ]
re ects the fact that the information to be retrieved by the hearer is not just `hates' in isolation but `x1 hates x2', where the values of the variables are xed by the
operators that bind them. In other words, the information of the sentence is `hates' but only when interpreted with respect to the ground `the boss is in some relation with broccoli'.
This crucial relational nature of focus has been defended by many authors in the literature and is the gist of Prince's (1981, 1986) account of focus, in which the `new information' carried by the sentence is the fact that the focus instantiates the

86

variable in the open-proposition (see x 3.1.4 above). The representation proposed
for tailful sentences adopts Prince's insight straightforwardly. There is also an important conceptual motivation behind this representation. If
the view of information packaging argued for in this study is correct, the purpose behind information-packaging instructions is to optimize the entry of information in the hearer's knowledge-store. They single out what part of the sentence makes a contribution to the hearer's knowledge-store and indicate where and how the hearer should enter that contribution. Information therefore, is central to the packaging instruction. As noted, all sentences must carry information since, otherwise, there is, in principle, no informational reason for the utterance to exist.
Most semantic and syntactic analyses of focus (cf. Chs. 6 and 7) put forward representations of focus-background structure where the focus is the element that is, in some way or another (as a quanti er-like element or a -abstracted term), abstracted away from the sentence to a peripheral position. Such an approach does not re ect the core status of focus as the informational motivation of the sentence. The representation proposed here captures this conceptual point by taking the allfocus sentences as basic and have take scope over the clause. The cases where there is a ground are, in some sense, derived from this basic all-focus structure by abstracting away the ground phrases, so that they can perform their task as dataentry instructions. In other words, a link and a tail exist only when they are needed to make sure that information is entered appropriately.
Taking this stance, we automatically obtain an e cient handling of the all-focus and the link-focus sentences, where most of the overt material is focal. In representations of focus that take the ground as basic and have the focus raise to a peripheral position, the incorporation of all-focus and link-focus cases is problematic.54
4.3.2 Some Facts Captured
There are a number of additional facts discussed in the pragmatic literature that the account as presented above did not incorporate directly but that are nevertheless captured in an indirect way. One is the feeling of `aboutness' that has inspired the
54See, for example, Rochemont's (1986) development of an LF rule of Focus Raising within the Government & Binding Theory of syntax, where all-focus sentences are focus-raised in their entirety leaving an empty clause behind (cf. Ch. 6).
87

notion of topic. Contrary to the view of the topic-comment approach, aboutness here is not a causal correlate of linkhood, but just a consequence of the fact that the information carried by the sentence is entered under the address denoted by the link. This is why speakers intuitively feel that, in some sense, the sentence is about the link and not about the other entities involved in the sentence, whose addresses are updated only via crossreferencing. Two other facts that are also incorporated into our analysis are contrastiveness and felicity conditions in topicalization. Discussion of these two issues, which was postponed above, is undertaken in this section.
Contrast
Contrast is a discourse notion which is found pervasively in the literature. Even though it is considered a primitive in, for example, Kuno 1972 and Chafe 1976, it has no place in our informational articulation. Contrast, however, is not a uni ed phenomenon in that there exist two distinct types. These two types of contrast are evident in examples (89) and (90):
(89) Broccoli I like, but pork rinds I hate.
(90) She gave a shirt to Harry, not a tuxedo.
There is a feeling of contrast both between the link phrases in (89) and in the focus of (90). Chafe seems to con ate the two in his `foci of contrast', but, as Szabolcsi (1981:158) observes, these two types of contrast are di erent in nature. We may label them link-contrast and focus-contrast.
Prince (1984:220), writing about felicity conditions for topicalization, argues that link-contrast is not a primitive but a derived notion. In her account of topicalization the topicalized phrase must represent an entity already evoked in the discourse, or else an entity standing in a salient set relation to another evoked discourse entity. The feeling of contrast that is obtained in most topicalizations is just an artifact of the set understanding that licenses the construction. Prince's formulation is later modi ed in Ward 1985 and Ward & Prince 1986, as will be seen in the next section, but they all share the view that contrastiveness is derivable as a `side-e ect' of the actual reason for topicalization.
88

In fact, link-contrast is also a derived notion from the perspective of aboutness. If a sentence is understood as being about a topic, then it may be understood that it is not about another topic, given the right opposition exists between both topics. In our system, link-contrast is derived in a similar way. If in (89), for instance, the hearer is told that s/he has to go to the address `broccoli' and enter the information of the sentence there, then it must mean that another (related) address like `pork rinds' should not be `gone to', and that, therefore, the information must not be entered under it. Link-contrast can be derived, then, the way it was derived in previous acounts.
Ward 1985, in order to account for the contrastive or set feeling of foci (focuscontrast), proposes that foci must belong to a relevant scale. Ward argues that the variable in the open-proposition must be on a scale and that the focus that instantiates the variable represents a value on that scale. Ward's proposal is valid for standard focus/open-proposition structures, but if one expands the notion of focus to include the focus in cases of all-focus and link-focus sentences, his approach loses some appeal, since it would be hard to nd a scale for, let us say, all-focus sentences. In our theory, focus-contrast is also a derived notion. As Ward points out, contrast occurs, for the most part, in the focus/open-proposition sentences, i.e. our link-focus-tail and focus-tail structures. In these tailful structures the focus operator is interpreted not as retrieve-add but as retrieve-substitute, i.e. retrieve the information of the sentence by substituting `focus' for the blank in the relevant ground frame. The blank in the relevant ground frame may be a real blank, as is in the examples discussed so far or the context in (91), where the utterer of (91)b assumes his/her hearer has the entry ` broccoli(x)' under the boss.
(91) a. S1 So we gave him =the boss] this huge bouquet of broccoli for his birthday and it looked like he was very happy with it.
b. S2 I don't get it. The boss HATES broccoli.
But the blank need not be a real blank. It may be some preexistent element that the hearer is instructed to substitute in an entry under a given address. For example, in (90), a shirt is meant as a substitute for a tuxedo, i.e., the speaker assumes that the hearer has the entry `gave a tuxedo to Harry(x)' under the current address and indicates with his/her informational encoding that `a tuxedo' must be removed and substituted by `a shirt'. What is substituted here is not a real blank but the
89

entry segment `a tuxedo', so that after (90) is uttered the entry under the current address is not `gave a tuxedo to harry(x)' but `gave a shirt to Harry(x)'. It is clear that in this case there is an inherent contrast between the two arguments of the focus operator `substitute x for y', one of which is the focus. In example (90), the contrastive feeling is provided by the operation of substitution carried out from `a tuxedo' to `a shirt'. The blank notation, then, is used as shorthand for any element that gets substituted in the manner described, be it a real blank or a preexistent elements that needs substitution.

Felicity in Topicalization

When the incompleteness of coverage in the focus-background articulation was dis-
cussed in x 3.1.4, it was mentioned that there was a sound proposal to cover the gap
in the work of Prince 1981, Ward 1985, and Ward & Prince 1986. Ward & Prince 1986, for instance, argue convincingly that the correct generalization capturing what felicity conditions must be met for topicalization to be licit is as follows:

Discourse Condition on Preposing in Topicalization: The entity represented by the preposed constituent must be related, via a salient partially ordered set relation poset], to one or more entities already evoked in the discourse model. (1986:4)

This criterion seems to account for all the data at hand, but there is one objection that may be raised: that this condition on preposing is a necessary condition but not a su cient one. In other words, there may be NPs that encode entities that are related via a poset to another entity in the discourse model which nevertheless appear in situ and not in a preposed slot. An example is (92), from Ward (1985:ex.109):

(92)

Colonel Bykov had delivered to Chambers in Washington six

Bokhara rugs which he directed Chambers to present as gifts from

him and the Soviet Government to the members of the ring who

had been most co-operative. One of these rugs Chambers delivered

to Harry Dexter White. Another he gave to : : :

Here it is not only the preposed phrase one of these rugs which is in a poset relation

with an entity in the previous discourse (set-subset), but also Chambers (identity),

and Harry Dexter White (set-subset HDW is a member of the ring).
