OBJECTIVES The goal of our study was to determine the incidence and predictors of atrial ﬂutter in the

general population.

BACKGROUND Although atrial ﬂutter can now be cured, there are no reports on its epidemiology in

unselected patients.

METHODS

The Marshﬁeld Epidemiological Study Area (MESA), a database that captures nearly all

medical care among its 58,820 residents was used to ascertain all new cases of atrial ﬂutter

diagnosed from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1995. To identify predisposing risk factors, we

employed an age- and gender-matched case-control study design using eight additional

variables.

RESULTS

A total of 181 new cases of atrial ﬂutter were diagnosed for an overall incidence of 88/100,000

person-years. Incidence rates ranged from 5/100,000 in those Ͻ50 years old to 587/100,000

in subjects older than 80. Atrial ﬂutter was 2.5 times more common in men (p Ͻ 0.001). The

risk of developing atrial ﬂutter increased 3.5 times (p Ͻ 0.001) in subjects with heart failure

and 1.9 times (p Ͻ 0.001) for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among

those with atrial ﬂutter 16% were attributable to heart failure and 12% to chronic obstructive

lung disease. Three subjects (1.7%) without identiﬁable predisposing risks were labeled as

having “lone atrial ﬂutter.”

CONCLUSIONS This study, the ﬁrst population-based investigation of atrial ﬂutter, suggests this curable

condition is much more common than previously appreciated. If our ﬁndings were applicable

to the entire U.S. population, we estimate 200,000 new cases of atrial ﬂutter in this country

annually. At highest risk of developing atrial ﬂutter are men, the elderly and individuals with

preexisting heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2000;36:

Atrial ﬂutter is a condition in which, as has recently been shown, the contraction wave follows a circular and never ending path in the auricle, the circuits being completed at a rate of from 240 to 350 per minute in different subjects.

Recent technological advances have improved our understanding of the electrophysiologic substrate responsible for atrial ﬂutter (2– 8). Clinical application of this knowledge has made catheter-based radiofrequency ablation (RFA) a safe and effective therapeutic procedure (9 –19).
Despite these technical developments, little is known about the epidemiology of atrial ﬂutter in the general population (20). Our objectives were to determine its incidence and predisposing conditions.

sin because the Marshﬁeld Clinic and St. Joseph’s Hospital provide almost all health care in this region. These institutions share a system of medical records including information on nearly all inpatient and outpatient encounters. The MESA has been established to conduct epidemiologic studies and population-based health research in a ZIP code-deﬁned region that includes Marshﬁeld and surrounding communities. Since most MESA residents (over 70%) have at least one health-related encounter every year and the health care status and the denominator of the population are updated daily, accurate longitudinal follow-up of individuals is possible. We have shown that over 95% of 58,820 area residents and virtually all health events are captured in the MESA database, including 99% of deaths, 94% of hospital discharges and 92% of medical outpatient visits (21). Electrocardiographic deﬁnitions. Only patients with electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of their ﬁrst episode of atrial ﬂutter (duration Ն5 s) were enrolled. Entry criteria required: a) standard 12-lead ECG or tracings obtained at the time of exercise stress test or b) ECG monitor or Holter strip recordings.
Atrial ﬂutter was considered to be present if there were visible and highly regular “F” waves at a rate Յ350 beats/ min. Highly regular “F” waves were deﬁned as those in which the cycle to cycle atrial variability was Յ10 ms. Atrial ﬂutter rate had to be greater than 190 beats/min among

patients receiving classes IA, IC or class III antiarrhythmic (AA) agents. In all others, the lowest acceptable atrial rate was 240 beats/min. Patient selection criteria. To identify potential incident cases of atrial ﬂutter, we used Marshﬁeld Clinic’s diagnostic database. Since 1979 this database has used the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) to track all diagnostic codes. To ensure complete ascertainment of all cases occurring from July 1, 1991 through June 30, 1995, we employed eight ICD, 9th revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-9-CM) codes in our initial screening. In addition to ICD 427.32 (atrial ﬂutter), we used seven additional codes including 410 (acute myocardial infarction), 426.7 (WolffParkinson-White syndrome), 427.0 (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [PSVT]), 427.2 (paroxysmal tachycardia unspeciﬁed), 427.31 (atrial ﬁbrillation), 427.81 (sinoatrial node dysfunction), 427.89 (other rhythm disorder, ectopic, nodal and wandering atrial pacemaker) and 427.9 (cardiac dysrhythmia, unspeciﬁed).
Since all patients diagnosed with these conditions were assessed for inclusion, approximately 2,000 potential incident cases of atrial ﬂutter were screened. Final case inclusion required ECG conﬁrmation atrial ﬂutter by cardiac electrophysiologists. All eligible cases were enrolled. During 220,000 person-years of observation, approximately 29,000 ECG and rhythm strips, 1,100 Holter monitors and 500 ambulatory event recordings were obtained from MESA residents. Selection of controls. Since age and gender are important predictors of disease and survival, each incident case was matched with a population-based control of the same age and sex. Controls were chosen randomly among MESA residents without previously documented atrial arrhythmias. Indications or complaints prompting health encounters among controls at the time of study entry were: a) a prescheduled ofﬁce visit in 61% (including 36% with eye or dental appointments or cutaneous or musculoskeletal concerns), b) scheduled laboratory or other diagnostic tests in 35% and c) urgent evaluations in 4% (half of these or 2% due to potential cardiovascular complaints). Data collection. Trained nurses undertook chart abstraction of risk factors. These were considered to be present if such condition was documented in the record before the diagnosis of atrial ﬂutter. Information was mostly collected from typed physicians’ notes. Quality assurance methods to

ensure data integrity included reabstraction of every 10th medical record, double data entry of a random sample of 10% of collected information as well as range and edit checks on all collected data. All predetermined quality assurance parameters were exceeded. Statistical analysis. Incidence. The entire population of MESA, including persons of all ages, was considered at risk for developing atrial ﬂutter. The number of veriﬁed incident cases was divided by the total number of person-years of observation of all MESA residents. Age- and genderspeciﬁc rates are presented as well as age-adjusted rates, calculated by using the 1990 U.S. census as standard. Predisposing risk factors. To identify potential comorbidities associated with the development of atrial ﬂutter, we used an age- and gender-matched case-control design in which atrial ﬂutter was the outcome variable. Risk factors potentially predisposing a subject to the development of atrial ﬂutter were chosen before data analysis. Selection of the 13 putative etiologic variables employed in the analysis was based on factors previously reported to predispose to atrial ﬁbrillation (22–25). Table 1 shows baseline clinical diagnoses among cases and controls. For descriptive analyses we compared distributions for categorical variables using a chi-square test. We used Student t test to compare means for continuous variables.

RESULTS
Incidence of atrial ﬂutter in the general population. Among 58,820 MESA residents, 181 new cases of atrial ﬂutter were diagnosed during the four years of ascertainment (Table 2). Of these patients, 105 (58%) also had at least one episode of atrial ﬁbrillation. The overall incidence of atrial ﬂutter in the general population is 88/100,000. “Atrial ﬂutter only” was 37/100,000 person-years. Adjusted for age, the incidence of atrial ﬂutter in men (125/100,000, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 102 to 149) was more than twice that of women (59/100,000, 95% CI, 44 to 73). As shown in Figure 1, the age-speciﬁc incidence of atrial ﬂutter increased with age in both males and females. Clinical features at initial diagnosis. Baseline characteristics of the 181 patients with atrial ﬂutter and their matched controls are shown in Table 1. For both groups the

mean age was 72 Ϯ 12 (mean Ϯ standard deviation) years, and 112 (62%) were men. The diagnosis was made by multichannel ECG recording in 104 patients (57%) and by 12-lead ECG in 77 patients (43%). Type I atrial ﬂutter was diagnosed in 90% of the patients. In three cases (1.7%) there were neither identiﬁable recent predisposing events nor chronic preexisting comorbidities. These patients were labeled as having “lone atrial ﬂutter.” The other 178 patients (98.3%) had either deﬁnite documentation of a potentially predisposing condition or proven structural heart disease. In 108 cases (59.7%) atrial ﬂutter occurred for the ﬁrst time ever within 30 days of a likely predisposing event (such as major surgical procedure, pneumonia, etc). Of these, 42 (23% of the total 181) had their initial episode within four weeks of coronary artery bypass or valve replacement surgery. In the remaining 70 cases (38.7%), atrial ﬂutter was associated with chronic comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. At the time of initial diagnosis of atrial ﬂutter, none had undergone RFA, and ﬁve patients (2.8%) were currently receiving AA drugs. Of these, four were taking type IA drugs, and one was taking a class III agent. None were on type IC AA agents. Factors predisposing the development of atrial ﬂutter. Individuals with a history of heart failure (HF), (RR 3.5, 95% CI, 1.7 to 7.1) or COPD (RR 1.9, 95% CI l, 1.1 to 3.4) were at increased risk of developing atrial ﬂutter.

lected variables are shown in Table 3. Because of the strength of association, the population-attributable risk for developing atrial ﬂutter was calculated. It was estimated that 15.8% and 11.6% atrial ﬂutter cases in this cohort could be attributed to HF and COPD, respectively. Antiarrhythmic drugs did not predispose a subject to the development of atrial ﬂutter.
DISCUSSION
Our current knowledge of atrial ﬂutter has been largely derived from the published clinical experience of patients referred to tertiary care centers (9 –19). Recent technological advances by these institutions have enhanced our understanding of the electrophysiologic mechanisms responsible for its initiation and maintenance (2– 8). Practical application of this information has resulted in the widespread use of catheter-based RFA as a safe and curative procedure in these individuals. Despite these great technological achievements, little is known regarding the magnitude of this problem or how to prevent atrial ﬂutter in the population at large (20). In fact, there are no previous reports on the epidemiology of atrial ﬂutter in the general population. Framingham, the only population-based study that enrolled patients with atrial ﬂutter, used a working deﬁnition of “atrial ﬁbrillation” that included cases with either “atrial ﬁbrillation or atrial ﬂutter on ECG.” Our data show that atrial ﬂutter is much more common than previously appreciated. Atrial ﬂutter in the general population. Adjusted for the U.S. population, the overall incidence of atrial ﬂutter is 88/100,000 person-years. While in clinical practice atrial ﬂutter appears to be less common than PSVT, our data show that in the general population, atrial ﬂutter is diagnosed for the ﬁrst time more than twice as often (26). If our results were extrapolated to the entire U.S. population, we estimate there would be 200,000 new cases of atrial ﬂutter in the U.S. annually. Approximately 80,000 of these would be cases of “atrial ﬂutter only.” Adjusted for age, the incidence of atrial ﬂutter in men (125/100,000) is more than 2.5 times that of women (59/100,000). The age-speciﬁc incidence of atrial ﬂutter increases exponentially with age (Fig. 1) from 5/100,000 person-years in those Ͻ50 years old to 587/

100,000 person-year among individuals Ն80 years, an increase of more than a hundred fold in the elderly. At the time of initial diagnosis, nearly all new cases (173 of 181, 96%) were Ͼ50 years of age. The incidence rate of atrial ﬂutter in this large subset of our patients is an astonishing 317/100,000 person-years, a ﬁgure that approaches that reported for atrial ﬁbrillation (27). Clinical risk factors associated with atrial ﬂutter. In addition to advancing age and male gender, at highest risk of developing atrial ﬂutter were MESA residents with HF and COPD. A weaker association was also noted for those with DM (p ϭ 0.07). The risk of developing atrial ﬂutter increased 3.5 times in HF (p Ͻ 0.001) and 1.9 times (p Ͻ 0.001) in those with COPD. Sixteen percent of atrial ﬂutter cases were attributable to HF and 12% to COPD. While we may have found previously unidentiﬁed risk factors for developing atrial ﬂutter, only a small portion of the new cases can be explained by these predisposing conditions alone. The contribution of HF, COPD, DM and other conditions may have been underestimated due to potentially incomplete ascertainment of mild cases.
At the time of the initial diagnosis, only four of 181 (2.2%) patients were taking AA drugs. It is unlikely, therefore, that the conversion of atrial ﬁbrillation into atrial ﬂutter is a likely etiology of atrial ﬂutter in the general population.
We have recently reported a kindred study with an autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy in which atrial ﬂutter is an early expression of the disease (28). Their genetically based cardiomyopathy was caused by a missense mutation in the rod domain of a lamin gene. Since one of the affected families was from MESA, we evaluated whether familial clustering on that basis was contributing to our ﬁndings. A comparison of the surnames of all 181 atrial ﬂutter cases in this epidemiologic study with the 13 last names in the two affected families failed to identify any evidence among study patients. These observations do not exclude a potentially genetic contribution to the development of atrial ﬂutter.
Further research is needed to determine whether aggressive efforts targeting earlier identiﬁcation of individuals at risk as well as primary prevention and innovative treatments

of the treatable predisposing conditions can impact the occurrence of atrial ﬂutter and its associated complications. Study limitations. We minimized selection bias by identifying practically all cases occurring in the entire population of a deﬁned region. Although ICD-9-CM coding of medical conditions may not be completely accurate, we used a large set of codes in an attempt to identify all cases. It is unlikely that we missed many, if any, incident cases of clinically signiﬁcant atrial ﬂutter. Given its intermittent and often asymptomatic nature and the existing technological limitations, complete ascertainment of atrial ﬂutter in any population would require life long continuous monitoring of all individuals in the area, a study not likely to ever be feasible or ethical. To identify risk factors for developing atrial ﬂutter, we used an age- and gender-matched casecontrol design in which atrial ﬂutter was the outcome variable. Unlike studies of volunteer cohorts screened over time, MESA represents an unselected sample representative of an entire population. The MESA population is predominantly white and rural. Though we are not aware of studies establishing racial, ethnic or residential predisposition to atrial ﬂutter, our results should be used cautiously to project to other population groups.
