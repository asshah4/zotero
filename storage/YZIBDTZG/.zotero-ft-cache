The Merriam-Webster online dictionary (1) deﬁnes author as “one that originates or creates.” It is an active term. In biomedical research, authorship most commonly involves the creation of new knowledge. The process of scientiﬁc authorship is exciting and rewarding. The thrill of new discovery and the resultant recognition by one’s peers are a heady mix. The rewards of authorship may be considerable and be related to promotions, success in securing research grants, tenure, and employment as a consultant. No wonder scientiﬁc authorship is valued and sought after.
In earlier times, research was commonly performed by a single investigator, so there was an immediate and obvious link from that single person who was both carrying out the investigation and writing the scientiﬁc report; they were the same. Over the years, the complexity of scientiﬁc investigations, which now frequently span several disciplines and perhaps institutions, has increased. Similarly, the organizational complexity of research institutions has also increased; there commonly are layers of investigators within research groups or departments. Finally, as medical research has become more global, varying cultural norms in different parts of the globe, where respect and appreciation for organizational leaders may mandate a recognition of their contributions to all research work published in their departments or section, have also served to affect the designation of authors of scientiﬁc manuscripts.
In the 1980s and 1990s there was increasing evidence (2–4) that the number of authors per article was increasing and that a number of the listed authors in these expanded author lists may not have made important contributions to the research manuscript that was being published. The terms guest, gift, or honorary author have been used

to describe individuals who, although listed on the byline as authors of an article, have not met authorship criteria for active participation in the research, in manuscript drafting, and in manuscript approval (5,6). In 1996, Slone (4) surveyed the ﬁrst authors of 275 major articles published in AJR American Journal of Roentgenology in 1992 and 1993. In that survey, the prevalence of what Slone termed undeserved authors averaged 17%, and increased from 9% in articles with three authors to 30% in those with six or more authors. Slone reported that manuscripts with undeserved authors were most likely to include nontenured staff who did meet authorship criteria. He further noted that the most commonly cited reason to include undeserved authors in their manuscripts was the desire for academic promotion. In a subsequent study with a broader sample, Flanagin et al (7) used a conﬁdential survey, which was mailed to the corresponding author, and reported on the prevalence of articles with honorary authors or ghost authors in six peerreviewed medical journals with varying levels of circulation. In their series, the prevalence of honorary authorship in the six journals ranged from 11%–25% and averaged 19% for the entire group.
With increasing awareness of the scope of the problem of honorary or undeserved authorship, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) in 1985 formally established requirements for authorship in biomedical journals (8). These criteria were revised in 2000 and currently include positive adherence to each of the following three items: (a) substantial contribution to the study conception and design, the acquisition of data, or the analysis and interpretation of data; (b) drafting of the manuscript or critical revision of it for important intellectual content; and (c) ﬁnal approval of the version to be published (9). The ICMJE

criteria explicitly state that “acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship.” In day-to-day practice, any author worthy of the name should be able to talk knowledgeably and off the cuff about the aims and ﬁndings of their published articles to an interested group for at least 5 minutes, for about 5 years after the article’s publication.
In recognition of this area of concern, in 1997 the guidelines for authors in Radiology were revised to require each author to identify their contribution to the manuscript. In 1998, Radiology began to print these author contributions with the articles (10). In September of 1999, the Radiology publication information for authors was revised to more speciﬁcally deﬁne the expectations for authorship in accordance with the “Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals” (8). No doubt, expectations were that by better clarifying the requirements for authorship and by including public statements of these, awareness of the requirements for authorship would increase and the problem of undeserved authorship would decrease. With this in mind, in 2003 Wang and colleagues (11) reviewed the adherence to authorship criteria in articles published in Radiology from June of 1998 through December of 2000. Disappointingly, they noted that in articles with more than three authors, only 68% of the listed authors fulﬁlled the ICMJE criteria; they also found that research from North American authors had a higher percentage of fulﬁllments (78%) than did work from non–North American authors (57%). These results were consistent with those of Goodman (12), who noted that one-third of authors in a small series of articles reviewed did not meet authorship criteria and those of Shapiro et al (3), who surveyed 1811 research articles and reported that 26% of authors had made insufﬁcient contributions to merit authorship. In their manuscript, Wang and colleagues (11) conclude that there is a need for further education on authorship requirements to improve compliance with these criteria.

Similarly, the editorial board of European Radiology has acted in broad agreement with the ICMJE criteria and is moving, with the publisher, toward use of the uniform ICMJE conﬂicts of interest and authorship forms. It also operates under the umbrella of the Committee of Publication Ethics (http://www .publicationethics.org/). Indeed, that organization has also advised journal editors about various aspects of publication, including authorship (13). To this end, European Radiology has, for some time, insisted on the conﬂict of interest form being signed by a “guarantor” for the entire study. This guarantor may be the tenured senior author, but it could be the head of the department, the research lead, or other tenured staff member who is designated to take overall responsibility for all aspects of the study (ethics, consent, authorship, data handling and storage, and all other aspects of good research practice). Such guarantor status is meant to provide a place for the department head to be acknowledged for the work going on under his or her overall direction but where he or she does not qualify for full authorship. It should also act as a quality control check, allowing any difﬁculties about authorship to be rectiﬁed locally before the paper reaches an editor’s desk.
In this issue of Radiology, Eisenberg and colleagues (14) intrepidly venture, once more, into this problematic and disturbing arena. They sent a survey to 1038 ﬁrst authors of all original research articles published in Radiology or European Radiology during a 3-year period. Surprisingly, of the 29% of ﬁrst authors responding, 26% believed that one or more of their coauthors did not make a sufﬁcient contribution to allow inclusion as an author, and more than double that percentage noted that one or more coauthors performed only “nonauthor tasks” in the study. In the univariable analysis of their data, signiﬁcant features associated with ﬁrst authors’ perceptions of the presence of honorary authors on their papers included lower academic rank, fewer peer-reviewed manuscripts published in the past 3 years, and “working in an environment where

the section or department head was automatically listed as an author.”
Furthermore, Eisenberg and colleagues noted an interesting difference regarding inclusion of senior colleagues as honorary authors in the two journals. There was a greater tendency for the section or department head to be automatically listed as a coauthor of articles in European Radiology (33.3%) than in Radiology (18.8%). Interestingly, the belief among ﬁrst authors that such practice was justiﬁed was fairly similar for both journals (37% and 33%, respectively). One possible explanation for the greater tendency for the section or department head to be automatically listed as a coauthor in European Radiology is that radiologists in European departments may believe that they rely more on patronage from their “chiefs” than do those in American departments. Certainly in those countries where promotion (and thereby salary) continues throughout a radiologist’s career, there is every incentive for including one’s “chief” as an author. Of course, in some situations, the department or section head is a totally justiﬁable author and has participated fully in the research. But, given the fact that only around onethird of ﬁrst authors believe that such inclusion is justiﬁed, it seems likely that there is still a substantial amount of gift or honorary authorship in this setting.
Before jumping to conclusions regarding this observed difference, one must consider the distribution of submissions: In 2010, China, Korea, and the United States were the sixth, seventh, and eighth most frequent sources of articles published in European Radiology. Thus, it is not a given that all reports published in European Radiology have a “European” culture of authorship. Indeed, even in Radiology, only around one-half of the published articles come from North America. Further work is needed to really capture differing philosophies in different cultures.
All these factors merely underline the gross variation in the way authors and journals interpret the recommendations from the ICMJE with respect to authorship and the way in which different departments and institutions

view, interpret, and implement these recommendations.
The study of Eisenberg and colleagues (14), particularly when viewed in the context of past studies, demonstrates that we still face a considerable problem in accurately and appropriately recognizing authorship in multiauthored biomedical research. Furthermore, it is clear that our efforts in establishing meaningful authorship criteria and in asking authors to speciﬁcally clarify their contributions, as well as in publishing them, have been ineffective in reducing the prevalence of honorary authorship. Taken as a whole, this research bears testimony to the limited control and inﬂuence journals and journal editors have on the ethical and cultural views of investigators and research institutions regarding authorship.
Furthermore, the results of the Eisenberg et al study suggest that we need to reconsider our approach to the problem of honorary authorship and, perhaps, redirect our efforts to some extent if we want to address this problem more effectively.
One might wonder if these efforts over the years in trying to ensure that the listed authors have meaningful roles in the creation of their manuscripts are misguided. Some authorities have suggested that research groups are complex intertwined entities in which some workers in the section or group doing clinical work or other important nonauthor tasks allow their colleagues the luxury of performing the investigation that has been reported and that this type of passive contribution to the overall scientiﬁc goal should entitle them to authorship (15). It is also possible to make the case that the department head, under whose largesse the research was performed, deserves the recognition afforded by being listed as an author.
Unfortunately, the effects of this potentially exploitative nature of the practice on younger investigators may serve to undermine the professional integrity of the work and ultimately call into question its credibility. If one cannot even believe who wrote the article, how can one believe the article’s content? More disturbingly, diffuse assignment

of authorship undermines scientiﬁc accountability. As has been noted in the past, honorary authors may not be willing to support and stand by the reported results when there are questions regarding their article’s conclusions and validity. In two well-known instances of scientiﬁc misconduct, senior authors were happy to beg off, saying in effect that they had no real involvement in the research (16,17). Equally important in a training environment rife with honorary authorship, young investigators may come to believe that scientiﬁc dishonesty in the guise of career advancement is the norm. Thus, despite these disturbing and unrelenting trends, it does not seem appropriate to abandon our efforts to correctly attribute authorship and to promote accuracy and integrity in all elements of the works we publish.
Many of the reports published over the years on the issue of honorary authorship suggest the need to redouble our efforts in educating authors on the appropriate criteria for authorship. While this is, of course, a laudable goal, the work of Eisenberg and colleagues (5) suggests that lack of information may not be the problem, since in their series 76% of authors said that they personally adhered to the journal requirements for authorship. Alternatively, while not abandoning our efforts to document appropriate authorship criteria, an editor might decide to continue with the current approach in the hopes that increasing awareness will, over time, solve the problem. However, the experience during the past decade suggests that maintaining a steady course is not likely to address the problem adequately.
A reasonable approach may be to recognize a category of contribution that rises above those that would normally be considered for an article’s acknowledgment section but does not quite reach the level of contribution required for authorship (5). Thus, authors might choose to list other important contributors whose assistance may consist of only a single component of the effort or under whose guiding tutelage the research was performed. This proposal is appealing on a number of fronts. It recognizes that there are, in fact, a range

of contributions to scientiﬁc investigations and provides the opportunity for appropriate acknowledgment of section or department leadership in the overall research effort. Implementation of this proposal might, of course, require support by major universities, professional organizations, and PubMed.
Clearly, the problems of authorship transcend individual journals and are rightly the concern of global professional organizations, specialty organizations, medical schools, and department leadership. While some medical schools have clearly described standards for authorship, many have not. In a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association published in 1998, Wilcox (18) noted a ﬁve-fold increase in the number of complaints related to authorship received by the Ofﬁce of the Ombudsman at Harvard Medical School (Boston, Mass). She noted the importance of clearly deﬁned guidelines for authorship and the need for involvement of leaders in research groups and departments in disseminating this information and in providing an appropriate tone for resolving disputes. She further suggested the need for independent conﬁdential channels to identify problems and encourage corrective action. For our discipline, positive statements by department leaders indicating their unwillingness to serve as honorary authors would undoubtedly highlight the importance of addressing this issue and in rightfully crediting authorship of manuscripts. Through the combined efforts of professional leadership, medical journals, and authors, we hope to ﬁnd an appropriate balance to recognize the contributions and avoid awarding inappropriate authorship.
One sad and salutary note on which to end is to point out the way several senior scientists have had their later careers damaged by accepting gift authorship on articles that turned out to be tarnished; the recent latest twist to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine saga in the United Kingdom is a case in point (19,20).
