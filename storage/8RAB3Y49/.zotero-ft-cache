SUMMARY
Aims: Sequential nephron blockade with thiazide-like diuretics is a strategy used to overcome diuretic resistance in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), but head-to-head studies are lacking and equipoise exists regarding the preferred thiazide-like diuretic in this setting. We thus compared the effectiveness of oral metolazone versus intravenous (IV) chlorothiazide as add-on therapy to loop diuretics in hospitalized patients with ADHF and renal dysfunction. Methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the efﬁcacy and safety of oral metolazone versus IV chlorothiazide as add-on therapy to loop diuretics in patients hospitalized with ADHF and renal dysfunction. The primary endpoint was net urine output (UOP) at 72 h after initiation of thiazide-like diuretics. Safety endpoints included worsening renal function, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. Results: Fifty-ﬁve patients were enrolled with 33 patients receiving metolazone and 22 patients receiving chlorothiazide. There was no difference in median net UOP at 72 h in those receiving metolazone (4828 mL, interquartile range [IQR] 2800–7209 mL) compared to chlorothiazide (3779 mL, IQR 1885–6535 mL) (P = 0.16). There was no difference in hypotension, worsening renal function, hyponatremia, or hypokalemia (P = NS for all comparisons). Hospital length of stay was shorter in the metolazone cohort (median 7 days) compared to chlorothiazide (median 15 days), suggesting the chlorothiazide cohort was likely sicker. Conclusion: Sequential nephron blockade with either metolazone or chlorothiazide appears to be efﬁcacious and safe in ADHF, renal dysfunction, and diuretic resistance. Given the considerable cost difference favoring oral metolazone, larger randomized studies are warranted to conﬁrm our ﬁndings and to exclude the possibility of confounding by indication.

Introduction
Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) characterized by volume overload accounts for 90% of the one million heart failure (HF)-related hospitalizations annually in the United States [1]. Data from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) reveal that 88% of patients hospitalized with ADHF receive intravenous (IV) loop diuretics during their admission [1– 3]. Despite lacking a proven survival beneﬁt, IV loop diuretics remain a cornerstone of ADHF therapy because of their ability to rapidly relieve congestive symptoms and restore euvolemia. Treatment with loop diuretics are thus recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy in the treatment of patients with ADHF associated with volume overload [4–6].
In ADHF, volume retention and congestion occurs predominantly due to increased sodium retention by the kidneys, induced by a multitude of upstream mechanisms including neurohormonal activation [4–6]. Loop diuretics exert their therapeutic

effect by inhibiting the sodium–potassium–chloride co-transporter in the ascending loop of Henle, a potent site of sodium reabsorption in the nephron. By inhibiting these transporters, loop diuretics provide a means by which excess sodium can be excreted, in turn leading to a potent aquaretic effect as well [7]. However, diuretic resistance may develop in HF patients with prolonged exposure to loop diuretics due to upregulation and hypertrophy of electrolyte transporters in the loop of Henle or distal convoluted tubule [8,9]. When these structural changes occur, the therapeutic effect of loop diuretics is blunted and enhanced sodium and water retention may occur. Diuretic resistance in ADHF becomes particularly challenging in patients with coexisting renal insufﬁciency as large doses of loop diuretics are often needed to achieve a sufﬁcient threshold to produce even a modest diuretic effect.
Sequential nephron blockade using thiazide-type diuretics has long been proposed as a strategy to overcome diuretic resistance in ADHF by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal

convoluted tubule. Such practice is even supported by the most recent, updated HF guidelines [6,8,9]. Yet, despite the common utilization of this treatment strategy, there are surprisingly few published studies available to guide a standard therapeutic approach. Consequently, the timing and choice of thiazide-type diuretics is often empiric, clinician-dependent, and not sufﬁciently data driven. Most of the studies and/or case series that do exist are quite small, usually lack comparator groups, and investigated a variety of different, older, and less commonly used thiazide-type diuretics compared to the agents more frequently used today [10– 22]. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, not even a single study has been published comparing the effectivenes and safety of two of the most commonly utilized thiazide diuretics in HF, metolazone or chlorothiazide, as add-on therapy to loop diuretics in ADHF. We thus conducted the present pilot study to compare the relative effectiveness of oral metolazone versus IV chlorothiazide as add-on therapy to furosemide in patients hospitalized with ADHF and renal insufﬁciency.
Methods
This was a single-center, retrospective, cohort study of patients hospitalized with ADHF between June 1, 2008, and December 31, 2011. A cut-off date of June 1, 2008, was chosen as this is when the electronic medical record was ﬁrst implemented at our institution, which was used to facilitate and ensure the accuracy of the data collection process. The study was approved by the University of Chicago investigational review board (IRB number 12-1403). A detailed review of each patient’s electronic medical record was used to obtain and/or conﬁrm patient demographics, comorbid conditions, vital sign information, measurements of total ﬂuid intake and urine output (UOP), home medication records, inpatient medication administration records, echocardiogram reports, and laboratory values. Individual, daily physician and nursing notes as well as all international classiﬁcation of disease, ninth edition (ICD-9) codes were also reviewed to verify the accuracy of the data.
Patient Selection
To be included into this study, patients were required to meet the following entry criteria:
1. ≥18 years of age. 2. Admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of ADHF (preserved
or reduced ejection fraction [EF]) based on the ICD-9 codes. 3. Presence of signiﬁcant renal insufﬁciency deﬁned by a creati-
nine clearance of 15–50 mL/min as calculated on day one of the study period (i.e., the day when either metolazone or chlorothiazide was added to the medical regimen). Creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation based on ideal body weight [23]. 4. Initial diuretic treatment was with IV furosemide monotherapy. 5. Metolazone or chlorothiazide therapy was subsequently added to furosemide during the ADHF hospitalization with maintenance of this combined regimen for at least 72 h in duration. A minimum of 72 h of exposure to add-on thiazide-type diuretic therapy was chosen to ensure sufﬁcient

time for the full effects of both metolazone and chlorothiazide to occur and for sufﬁcient exposure to each drug to allow for a meaningful comparison.
Day one of the study period was the date on which add-on therapy with metolazone or chlorothiazide was initiated. All patients received the ﬁnal dose of metolazone a minimum of 48 h after its initiation, and for chlorothiazide, the ﬁnal dose was administered at a minimum of 60 h after its initiation. These speciﬁc criteria were chosen based on established drug half-lives and recommended dosing intervals; metolazone has a half-life of approximately 20 h, allowing for once-daily dosing as compared to IV chlorothiazide which has a shorter half-life and is thus often dosed twice daily [24,25].
Patients were excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:
1. If a patient received both metolazone and chlorothiazide during the study period.
2. If a patient received a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic in the hospital prior to the study period.
3. The presence of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. 4. Use of any form of renal replacement therapy (i.e., continuous
veno-venous hemoﬁltration and/or slow, continuous ultraﬁltration) during the index hospital stay prior to being treated with either metolazone or chlorothiazide (patients who may have ultimately progressed to requiring renal replacement therapy after the study period were not excluded). 5. The presence of cirrhosis. 6. Severe malnutrition as deﬁned by an albumin of <2.5 g/dL.
Study Endpoints
The primary efﬁcacy endpoint in this study was net UOP (total recorded UOP minus total recorded ﬂuid intake) 72 h after the addition of either oral metolazone or IV chlorothiazide therapy to the patient’s furosemide regimen. Secondary efﬁcacy endpoints included total UOP at 72 h, net and total UOP at 12-h increments after initiation of metolazone or chlorothiazide, respectively, and achievement of at least 3000 mL of net UOP at 72 h.
Safety endpoints included worsening renal function (deﬁned by an increase in serum creatinine of >0.5 mg/dL from the patients’ baseline value on the day of thiazide-type diuretic initiation); worsening electrolyte imbalances during the study period including hypokalemia (deﬁned by a potassium value of <3.5 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (deﬁned by a magnesium value of <1.6 mg/dL), and hyponatremia (deﬁned by a sodium value of <135 mEq/L); and hypotension (measured systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and/or a 20% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline at any point during the study period).
Statistical Methods
Baseline characteristics for all patients were expressed as percentages for categorical variables and mean Æ standard deviation for continuous variables that were normally distributed. Rightskewed data were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences between treatment groups for categorical

variables were analyzed using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t-test or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, as determined by the normality of the data. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 11.0, College Station, TX, USA.
We initially identiﬁed 292 patients with ADHF who received IV furosemide plus oral metolazone or IV chlorothiazide during the study period. After applying the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, we arrived at a ﬁnal study cohort of 55 patients (33 patients in the oral metolazone group and 22 patients in the IV chlorothiazide group). Figure 1 displays a ﬂow chart of where the major exclusion criteria were applied.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline demographics were similar for each of the two treatment groups (Table 1). The median age of the patients was 70 years (IQR 59–76.5 years), 68% were male, and the majority (78.6%) were African American. There were no major differences in comorbidities between the two cohorts (Table 1). This was largely a reduced EF HF population with a median EF 33% (IQR 18.8– 49.5%). In fact, only two patients (one from each cohort) had an EF of 50% or greater. Baseline home HF medication regimens were similar in both groups, although patients in the metolazone group were prescribed a slightly higher home loop diuretic dose equivalent as compared to the chlorothiazide group (90 mg vs. 70 mg; P = 0.01) (Table 1). Interestingly, signiﬁcantly more patients in the metolazone arm (n = 7) compared to the chlorothiazide arm (n = 0) were being treated with device therapy (biventricular pacemakers and/or implantable cardiac deﬁbrillators) (P = 0.02).
Diuretic Dosing
There were some notable differences in total diuretic dosing between the groups during the study period. Over the course of the 72-h study period, the median total dose of IV furosemide was

500 mg (IQR 240–720 mg) in the metolazone group and 1015 mg (IQR 775–1300 mg) in the chlorothiazide group (P < 0.001). The median metolazone total dose was 7.5 mg (IQR 7.5–10 mg), and the median chlorothiazide total dose was 2500 mg (IQR 1750– 2500 mg). When diuretic dosing was analyzed by each individual day of the 72-h study period, the median daily dose of metolazone was 2.5 mg (IQR 2.5–2.5 mg). The median daily dose of chlorothiazide was 500 mg (IQR 500–875 mg) on day 1, 750 mg (IQR 500– 1000 mg) on day 2, and 1000 mg (625–1000 mg) on day 3.
Efﬁcacy Endpoints
Although numerical trends were observed favoring metolazone, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences among the two cohorts for any of the efﬁcacy endpoints. For the primary endpoint of net UOP at 72 h, the metolazone group had a median net UOP of 4828 mL (IQR 2800–7209 mL) versus a median 3779 mL (IQR 1885–6535 mL) with chlorothiazide (P = 0.16) (Figure 2). The secondary endpoint of net UOP of at least 3000 mL achieved at 72 h occurred in 73% of patients receiving metolazone versus 55% of patients treated with chlorothiazide (P = 0.17). A breakdown of net UOP at each 12-h interval in the study between the two groups can be seen in Figure 3. Finally, there was no difference in total UOP between metolazone (median 9442 mL, IQR 5943–12441) versus chlorothiazide (median 7500 mL, IQR 5800– 10002 mL) (P = 0.47).
Safety Endpoints
There were no signiﬁcant differences between the metolazone group and the chlorothiazide group in regard to the deﬁned safety endpoints. Overall, only two patients in the metolazone group and three patients in the chlorothiazide group experienced worsening renal function and hypotension occurred rarely in either group. Signiﬁcant hypokalemia, however, was quite common, occurring in nearly half of the patients from both groups.
Subgroup Analyses
In those patients with the most impaired renal function (restricted to those with a creatinine clearance of 15–30 mL/min), there was no signiﬁcant difference in net UOP at 72 h between the metolazone group (n = 21; median net UOP of 4696 mL, IQR 2872–6858) and the chlorothiazide group (n = 14; median net UOP 3240, IQR 2218–6675) (P = 0.44, Figure 4). However, when we extended the analyses to those with a creatinine clearance of 15–40 mL/ min, there was a trend toward greater net UOP at 72 h favoring metolazone-treated patients (n = 28; median net UOP of 4762 mL, IQR 2955–6895 mL) compared to chlorothiazide-treated patients (n = 20; median net UOP 3239 mL, IQR 982–5727 mL) (P = 0.11). Net UOP of at least 3000 mL at 72 h also trended in favor of metolazone-treated patients (75% vs. 50% achieved; P = 0.07).
In terms of acuity/severity of illness, the use of inotropic therapy during the hospitalization was similar between the metolazone group (six patients on dobutamine, one patient on milrinone) and the chlorothiazide group (seven patients on dobutamine, one patient on dobutamine plus dopamine) (P = 0.22). However,

Discussion
The management of diuretic resistance in patients hospitalized with ADHF remains a complex, difﬁcult to treat condition with

widely varying and often empiric strategies. The addition of thiazide-type diuretics to loop diuretics is hampered by a relative paucity of supportive, published data, especially in the setting of renal dysfunction. Additionally, whether metolazone or chlorothiazide, the two most commonly used thiazide-type diuretics in HF, is of superior efﬁcacy and/or safety has not been studied. In fact, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study (prospective or retrospective) to compare the effects of metolazone versus chlorothiazide as add-on

Figure 3 Net urine output (UOP) was derived from each 12-h interval spanning the entire 72-h study period during which add-on diuretic therapy was utilized. Net UOP was calculated as total collected UOP— total documented ﬂuid intake. As with the primary endpoint of net UOP at 72 h, while the metolazone group had numerically greater net UOP at each 12-h increment compared to chlorothiazide, this did not meet statistical signiﬁcance with the exception of the ﬁrst 12 h of therapy.

therapy in patients hospitalized with ADHF. We demonstrate that the addition of thiazide-type diuretics does, indeed, effectively augment diuresis in ADHF patients with diuretic resistance, even in the face of signiﬁcant renal dysfunction. Perhaps as importantly, we also did not observe a statistically signiﬁcant difference between oral metolazone and IV chlorothiazide in terms of either efﬁcacy or safety of augmenting diuresis in this challenging clinical setting.
Hospitalizations for ADHF have become a topic of growing national attention in both the research and political arenas because of its increasing frequency and burden on healthcare resources. In addition to survival, endpoints of relevance include identifying ways to reduce both hospital length of stay and readmissions. Considerable evidence exists correlating the degree of achieved volume removed during ADHF hospitalizations with improved ADHF outcomes, including reduced hospital readmissions [26–33]. Thus, there has long been substantial interest to identify superior strategies to effectively and safely remove volume in ADHF. For instance, because of concerns related to potential adverse effects of diuretics on renal function coupled with encouraging results from the Ultraﬁltration versus Intravenous Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (UNLOAD) trial, the Ultraﬁltration in Decompensated Heart Failure with Cardiorenal Syndrome (CARRESS-HF) trial was recently conducted to compare an aggressive diuretic strategy versus ultraﬁltration in ADHF and renal insufﬁciency [27,34]. Unfortunately, the strategy of ultraﬁltration was not superior and, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, was associated with an increase in adverse events, particularly worsening renal function [34].
At around the same time as CARRESS-HF, [35] the large, multicenter trial of Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) study comparing a continuous infusion of furosemide compared to IV boluses of furosemide was performed. Ultimately, this study failed to identify a beneﬁt favoring either diuretic strategy [36]. While data now exist comparing ultraﬁltration versus diuretics and continuous versus bolus loop diuretic treatment in ADHF, surprisingly few data exist regarding the common practice of

Thiazide Diuretic Use in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure

add-on therapy with thiazide-type diuretics in ADHF, particularly in patients with coexisting renal insufﬁciency who are among the highest risk for HF morbidity and mortality [37–40]. Whereas previous small, retrospective studies have assessed the individual efﬁcacy of either metolazone or chlorothiazide in ADHF, a head-tohead comparison has not been performed to date [10,12,16,19–22]. Furthermore, there exist no published studies assessing the relative effectiveness and safety of thiazide-type diuretics in the setting of ADHF and renal insufﬁciency, a challenging but not particularly uncommon clinical scenario in ADHF when loop diuretic augmentation is needed due to diuretic resistance.
As clinical equipoise exists regarding the efﬁcacy and safety of individual thiazide-type diuretics frequently used in HF, other factors may dictate the selection of drug for an individual patient. For instance, chlorothiazide has the advantage of being available in IV form, which may be advantageous in those with signiﬁcant gastrointestinal edema and variable absorption or in patients who cannot take oral medications. On the other hand, there is concern that chlorothiazide may not be adequately ﬁltered through the glomerulus to reach its site of action in patients with renal insufﬁciency [10,24,41]. Metolazone is thought to not be signiﬁcantly affected by impaired glomerular ﬁltration but may suffer from reduced bioavailability in patients with signiﬁcant gastrointestinal edema [10,25,41]. Importantly, however, where equipoise does not exist among these thiazide diuretics is in regard to cost. Perhaps underappreciated is that a standard 250 or 500 mg dose of IV chlorothiazide is considerably more expensive than a 2.5 or 5.0 mg dose of PO metolazone. In fact, a single IV dose of chlorothiazide 500 mg (~$348.00) is on average more than 200-fold more expensive than a single PO dose of metolazone 5 mg (~$1.51) [42,43]. Because the inpatient management of HF is currently the single most expensive diagnosis-related group (DRG), with an estimated annual cost of 20 million dollars, identifying cost-saving measures without compromising patient care is of critical importance [44]. Although the current study should best be considered hypothesis-generating given the epidemiologic limitations of retrospective studies, should a subsequent larger, prospective study demonstrate noninferiority of PO metolazone compared to IV chlorothiazide, the potential costsavings would be of signiﬁcant value.
While not achieving statistical signiﬁcance in this study, there were numerical trends in the measured efﬁcacy endpoints that favored metolazone. Speciﬁcally, patients receiving metolazone achieved a greater net UOP at 72 h than those receiving chlorothiazide and a greater percentage of patients in the metolazone group achieved at least 3000 mL of net UOP in 72 h. Moreover, it appears that trends favoring metolazone occurred despite the fact that chlorothiazide may have actually been dosed more aggressively than metolazone. According to current HF guidelines, it is recommended to begin with doses of chlorothiazide 250 mg and metolazone 2.5 mg, respectively, and up titrate as needed [5,6]. Yet, in this study, the median total amount of add-on thiazidetype diuretic received in the 72-h study period was 2500 mg of chlorothiazide and 7.5 mg of metolazone. Based on this approximate conversion, patients in the chlorothiazide group received about three times more thiazide diuretic than metolazone-treated patients.

The aforementioned numerical trends should be interpreted with caution and should best be considered exploratory as there are several reasons to believe that patients in the chlorothiazide cohort may have been sicker or at least more diuretic resistant. First, although the baseline home doses of loop diuretic prior to admission were similar between the two groups, in the chlorothiazide treatment group, the total IV furosemide dose was 1.5 times greater prior to the initiation of chlorothiazide and twice as great during the 72-h study period as compared to the total IV furosemide dose in the metolazone group during the same, corresponding time periods (Table 1). Next and perhaps most suggestive of a difference in ADHF severity between the two groups is the signiﬁcantly longer hospital length of stay in the chlorothiazide group (median 16 days) compared to the metolazone group (median 7 days). Finally, it is possible that some patients who received IV chlorothiazide (and not PO metolazone) did so because of a perceived inability to take oral medications, a likely sign of increased severity of illness.
From a safety perspective, neither hypotension nor worsening renal function was common in either thiazide cohort. Not unexpectedly, a substantial percentage of patients from both groups developed hypokalemia or hyponatremia during treatment, indirectly underscoring the potency of this class of medications, particularly when combined with a loop diuretic.
Study Limitations
There are several important limitations of this study. First, this was a single-center, retrospective, non-randomized study and is thus subject to the biases and confounders inherent to such studies. As such, while this pilot study comparing IV chlorothiazide and PO metolazone may be informative, the ﬁndings should be considered hypothesis-generating only. Second, although UOP results were meticulously gathered for each patient via the electronic medical record, the possibility of information bias could exist should signiﬁcant errors in UOP charting have occurred. However, both cohorts in the study would be equally at risk for any errors that may have occurred in the recording of UOP. Additionally, the size of the study was relatively small. However, we felt this was ultimately necessary to apply relatively strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, enabling us to best identify and study the utility of thiazide-like diuretics in our speciﬁc cohort of interest, notably patients with ADHF, renal insufﬁciency, and diuretic resistance. We opted for this study design instead of one of being all-inclusive and introducing post hoc statistical techniques such as propensity matching, a reasonable strategy, but one which has its own inherent limitations. Thus, caution should be used when extrapolating the results of this study to patients whose comorbid conditions excluded them from study entry (i.e., hypoalbuminemia). Also, a majority of patients in this study were African American. While this may reﬂect the demographic of patients at our medical center, an at-risk group for diuretic resistance, or both, this may limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings. Finally, because the vast majority of patients in this study had a reduced EF, these results may be less applicable to those with HF with a preserved EF.

Thiazide Diuretic Use in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure

M. P. Moranville et al.

Conclusions
In patients hospitalized with ADHF, renal insufﬁciency, and diuretic resistance receiving add-on thiazide-type diuretic treatment, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in efﬁcacy or safety between PO metolazone and IV chlorothiazide. While it is notable and perhaps even provocative that a numerically greater net increase in net and total UOP was observed in those receiving PO metolazone as compared to IV chlorothiazide, these results should be considered hypothesisgenerating and not conclusive of equivalence. Thus, while our study suggests that either PO metolazone or IV chlorothiazide appears reasonable as add-on therapy in ADHF patients to combat diuretic resistance, we believe that our ﬁndings support the need for a large, randomized, multicenter head-tohead trial of add-on oral metolazone versus IV chlorothiazide whose major primary and secondary endpoints should include relevant clinical outcome measures such as death, hospital length of stay, recurrent ADHF hospital readmissions, and cost considerations.
