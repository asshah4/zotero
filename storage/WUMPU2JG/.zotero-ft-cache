The doctrine of Evolution daily gailns new adherents. It islnot
simply synonymous with Darwinism. Herbert Spencer applies it to all orders of phenomena. His application of it to the -nervous systemii is most importanit for medical men. I have long thought that we shall be very muclh helped in our investigations of diseases of the
nervous system by considering them as reversals of evolutioni, that is,

I speak only insane of the most striking aspects of evolution and dissolution, leaving what enitirely out of accounit some very important factors specially insisted
on by Herbert Spencer. I regret that time renders it necessary for me to simplify my suibject by serious omissions. Spencer, to wvhom I am
wlhat uinder the deepest obligations, must not be judged by my present
application of his doctrines, or, rather, of part of them. I have to ask pardon for the use in this lecture of some popular terms. "Most
wlhiclh can voluntary," thouglh it lhas a techniical sound, is, when used in contrast enough, however, to "most automatic," a popuilar term ; later on, it will be discarded.
and I have also to acknowledge an omission ; I speak for the most part of
the cerebral system only, almost ignorinl all divisions of the cerebellar
s nervous wlhole syssatemme system. For the presenit, I neglect the absolute distinctioii which
there really is between mental anid nervous states.

verbal utterances. "Yes" and "no" are eviflemtly most general, for they assent to, or dissent from, any statement whatever. In consequence of being frequently used, the correlative nervous arranigements
are of necessity highly organised; and, as a further consequence, they are deeply automatic. c. A more imiportant though not more signifi-
cant illustration is, that the patient, who cannot get out a word in
speech, nevertheless understands all that we say to him. Plainly,
this shows loss of a most voluntary service of words, with per-
sistence of a more automatic service of words. d. There are three degrees of the utterance " no " by aphasics. A patient may use it emotionally
only; most automatic service. Another patient may also be able to reply correctly with it; a less automatic, but still very automatic, service (here there is some real speech). There is still a higher use of it, which some aphasics have not got. A patient who can reply "no" to a question, may be unable to say " no " when told to do so. You ask the aphasic, " Is your name Jones ?" He replies, "No." You tell him to " say no ;" he tries and fails. You next ask, "Are you a hundred years old ?" He replies, " No." You tell him to "sav no he cannot. Whilst not asserting that the inability to say "no" when told is a failure in language, it is asserted that such inability, with retention of power to use the word in reply, illustrates dissolution. c. A patient, who is speechless, may be unable to put out his tongue when told to do so ; that he knows wuhat is wanted, is sometimes shown by his putting his fingers in his mouth to help out the organ. That the tongue is not paralysed in the ordinary sense is easily proven; the patient swallows well, which he could not do if his tongue were so much paralysed as " it pretends to be ;" besides, on other'oecasions, he sticks the tongue out, for example to catch a stray crumb.

[The lecturer then remarked on swearing, and on the utterance of other and innocent ejaculations by aphasics, remarking that some of these utterances have elaborate propositional structure, but no propositional value ; the patients could not repeat wlhat under excitement they uttered glibly and well. lie spoke next of the frequent retention of some recurring utterances 'by aphasics, such as "Comlie ol 'to me." Thlese were not, from the mouth of the aphasic, of any propositional value, they were not speech. He had no explanation to offer' of them; but stated the hypothesis that they were the words the patient was uttering, or was about to utter, at the time he was taken ill.]
8. So far I have spoken of local dissolutions occurring on but one half of the nervous system on different levels. Comingf to the highest centres, I speak- of uniform dissolutions, of cases in whiclh all divisions of these centres are subjected to the same evil influence. I choose some cases of insanity. In doing this, I am taking up the miiost difficult of all nervous, diseases. I grant that it is not possible to show' in detail that theyexemplify the principle of dissolution, but choosing the simplest of these most complex cases, we may show clearly that they illustrate it in general. I take a very commonplace example, delirium in acute non-cerebral disease. This, scientifically regarded, is a 'case of insanity. In this, as in all other cases of insanity, it is imperative to take equally into account not only the dissolution, but also the lower level of evolution that remains. The patient's condition is partly negative and partly positive. Negatively, he ceases to know that he is in hospital, and ceases to recognise persons about him. In other words, he is lost to his surroundings, or, in equivalent terms, he is defectively conscious. We must not say that he does'not know where he is, because he is defectively conscious. His not knowing where he is is itself defect of consciousness. The negative mental state signifies, on' the physical side, exhaustion, or loss of function somehow caused, of sonie highest nervous arrangements of his highest 'centres.. We may conveniently say that it shows loss of function of the topmost " layer " of his highest centres. No one, of course, believes that the highest centres, or any other centres, are in layers; but the supposition will simplify exposition. The other half of his condition is positive. Besides his not knowings, there are his wrong knowings. He imagines himself to be at home or at work, and acts, as far as practicable, as if he were. Ceasing to recognise his nurse as a nurse, he takes her to be his wife. This, the positive part of his condition, shows activity of the second layer of his
