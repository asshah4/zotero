Background: The natural history of atrial flutter is not well
defined.
Objective: To report the risk for stroke, conversion to atrial
fibrillation, and anticoagulation for lone atrial flutter.
Design: Retrospective cohort analysis.
Setting: A clinically based longitudinal study of inpatients and
outpatients with atrial flutter.
Patients: The authors compared the stroke rate in 59 patients
with atrial flutter with rates in a sample in which age- and sexspecific ischemic cerebrovascular event rates were determined and in a sample of nonhypertensive patients with lone atrial fibrillation. The risk for developing atrial fibrillation after presenting with atrial flutter is also reported.

Measurements: Electrocardiograms and clinical data were col-
lected and reviewed for each study participant.
Results: After adjustment for age and sex, patients with atrial
flutter had a higher incidence of thromboembolic events than the sample control patients and patients with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation developed in 56% of patients with atrial flutter.
Conclusions: Lone atrial flutter has a stroke risk at least as high
as lone atrial fibrillation and carries a higher risk for subsequent development of atrial fibrillation than in the general population. Anticoagulation should be considered for all patients with atrial flutter who are older than 65 years of age.

The objective of this study was to determine the longterm rate of thromboembolism and the risk for subsequent development of atrial ﬁbrillation in patients who initially presented with lone atrial ﬂutter.
METHODS Between 1965 and 1995, 567 patients from Olmsted
County, Minnesota, were seen with atrial ﬂutter. We excluded patients with any of the following conditions at the time of initial presentation: coronary artery disease, hyperthyroidism, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or antecedent atrial ﬁbrillation. We included patients with a history of controlled hypertension. We also excluded patients who were missing electrocardiographic documentation of atrial ﬂutter, who had life-shortening disease, or whose atrial ﬂutter occurred only as a consequence of an acute illness. Two physicians reviewed electrocardiograms to conﬁrm the diagnosis. Atrial ﬂutter was deﬁned as a regular monomorphic rhythm with atrial rate greater than 240 beats/ min and less than 350 beats/min. The Mayo Institutional Review Board, Rochester, Minnesota, approved the study.
Control Groups The ﬁrst control group was a previously deﬁned sam-
ple in Rochester, Minnesota, in which age- and sex-speciﬁc ischemic cerebrovascular event rates were determined for the period of 1965 to 1994 (referred to as the incident cohort). The second control group consisted of Olmsted County patients who had no history of hypertension and received a diagnosis of lone atrial ﬁbrillation from 1950 to 1980 (1, 2).

Statistical Analysis Continuous variables were summarized as means Ϯ 1
SD, and categorical variables were summarized as percentages. Survival without atrial ﬁbrillation or stroke or transient ischemic attack was estimated by using the Kaplan– Meier method, and comparisons between patient groups were based on the log-rank test. The standardized stroke or transient ischemic attack rates were deﬁned as the ratio of observed strokes or transient ischemic attacks in the patient cohorts divided by the expected number of strokes or transient ischemic attacks when applying the age- and sexspeciﬁc rates obtained from the incident cohort. The estimated rate of survival without stroke is expressed as the ratio of observed rates to the age- and sex-adjusted expected rates.
Cox proportional hazards techniques were used to identify variables associated with rates of survival without atrial ﬁbrillation and survival without stroke or transient ischemic attack. Because of the small numbers of events, the multivariate models consisted of only 3 variables: age; sex; and 1 of the following: body mass index, ejection fraction, duration of ﬁrst atrial ﬂutter episode (dichotomized as Ͻ24 hours or Ն24 hours), diabetes, history of cerebrovascular event, history of hypertension, and symptoms. All tests were 2-tailed, and a P value of 0.05 was the level of signiﬁcance.
Follow-up continued until January 2001 or death. A neurologist adjudicated all cerebrovascular events.
Role of the Funding Source This study was funded through a grant from Mayo
Foundation, which had no role in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data or in the decision to publish the manuscript.

Brief Communication Natural History of Lone Atrial Flutter

Context While the adverse consequences of atrial fibrillation have received much attention, we know little about the outcomes of people with lone atrial flutter.
Contribution Among 59 patients with lone atrial flutter cared for at the Mayo Clinic between 1965 and 1995, 33 developed atrial fibrillation and 19 sustained a cerebrovascular event over an average follow-up of 10 years. The rate of thromboembolic events observed in this sample of patients with lone atrial flutter was at least as high as that observed in patients with atrial fibrillation.
Cautions This observational study cannot tell us whether treatment for atrial flutter and anticoagulation would improve outcomes for people with lone atrial flutter.

RESULTS
Fifty-nine patients developed lone atrial ﬂutter during the 30-year period (Table); 75% developed recurrent episodes or chronic ﬂutter. The average age at diagnosis was 70 years (range, 40 to 97 years). No patient with atrial

ﬂutter had clinically evident heart disease at the time of initial diagnosis. However, 20 patients had controlled hypertension, 11 had diabetes mellitus, 3 had had a transient ischemic attack (2 years, 6 years, and 10 years before diagnosis of atrial ﬂutter, respectively), and 1 had had an ischemic stroke (9 years before diagnosis of atrial ﬂutter). The clinical characteristics of the patients with controlled hypertension and atrial ﬂutter did not statistically signiﬁcantly differ from those of the nonhypertensive patients with atrial ﬂutter.
Medical therapy was started in 88% of patients: digitalis (61%), ␤-blockers (17%), calcium-channel blockers (31%), and antiarrhythmic drugs (24%). Four patients underwent atrial ﬂutter ablation.
At the time of diagnosis, 31 patients received antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy (25 patients received aspirin, and 6 patients received warfarin) to prevent embolic events. The other patients did not receive any antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy. At latest follow-up, 41 patients were being treated with antithrombotic or antiplatelet agents (28 patients received aspirin, and 13 patients received warfarin) to prevent embolic events.
Subsequent Development of Atrial Fibrillation
Atrial ﬁbrillation developed in 33 patients (paroxysmal in 25 patients and chronic in 8 patients). The average (ϮSD) time from atrial ﬂutter diagnosis to atrial ﬁbrillation was 5 Ϯ 6 years (range, 0 to 25 years) (Figure). Unadjusted associations for the risk for atrial ﬁbrillation were female sex (hazard ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.95 to 4.2]; P ϭ 0.07), diabetes (hazard ratio, 2.6 [CI, 1.1 to 6.0]; P ϭ 0.028), hypertension (hazard ratio, 2.9 [CI, 1.4 to 6.1]; P ϭ 0.005), recurrent atrial ﬂutter (hazard ratio, 2.6 [CI, 0.91 to 7.6]; P ϭ 0.074), and older age at the time of diagnosis of atrial ﬂutter (hazard ratio, 1.05 [CI, 1.01 to 1.08]; P ϭ 0.007). Signiﬁcant age- and sex-adjusted predictors for developing atrial ﬁbrillation were diabetes (hazard ratio, 2.7 [CI, 1.1 to 6.4]; P ϭ 0.029), hypertension (hazard ratio, 2.4 [CI, 1.2 to 5.1]; P ϭ 0.02), and recurrent atrial ﬂutter (hazard ratio, 3.1 [CI, 1.03 to 9.1]; P ϭ 0.044).
Cerebrovascular Events Nineteen patients, with a mean (ϮSD) age of 80 Ϯ 10
years, experienced at least 1 cerebrovascular ischemic event during follow-up. The mean (ϮSD) time from atrial ﬂutter diagnosis to cerebrovascular event was 4.3 Ϯ 3.9 years. Of the 19 patients, 6 developed atrial ﬁbrillation after the atrial ﬂutter diagnosis but before the event. Of the 4 patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack before the atrial ﬂutter diagnosis, only 1 patient had a cerebrovascular event during follow-up.
Among patients with atrial ﬂutter, 77% were free of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, whichever occurred ﬁrst, at 5 years and 65% were free of one of these events at 10 years. Among the incident cohort, 94% at 5 years and 89% at 10 years were free of one of these events

(standardized stroke or transient ischemic attack rate, 3.3 [CI, 2.1 to 5.2]; P Ͻ 0.001). Patients with controlled hypertension and atrial ﬂutter had an estimated 5- and 10year survival rate without cerebrovascular events of 70% and 52%, respectively, as compared with 80% and 75% for nonhypertensive patients, respectively (log-rank P ϭ 0.099), with an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of 2.3 (CI, 0.87 to 6.0; P ϭ 0.094). However, both the patients with controlled hypertension and atrial ﬂutter and nonhypertensive patients with atrial ﬂutter had statistically significant higher rates of stroke or transient ischemic attack than the incident cohort (standardized stroke or transient ischemic attack rate, 5.2 [CI, 2.7 to 9.9; P Ͻ 0.001] and 2.5 [CI, 1.3 to 4.6; P ϭ 0.002], respectively).

Figure. Kaplan–Meier curves depict the time without conversion to atrial fibrillation from the initial lone atrial flutter diagnosis.

Comparison with Patients with Lone Atrial Fibrillation Data from the 59 patients with atrial ﬂutter were com-
pared with those from 145 patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. The atrial ﬂutter group had a larger percentage of women (44% vs. 28%; P ϭ 0.04), was older on average (70 Ϯ 12 years of age vs. 55 Ϯ 17 years of age; P Ͻ 0.001), and had less follow-up time on average (10 Ϯ 6 years vs. 13 Ϯ 8 years; P ϭ 0.002) than the atrial ﬁbrillation group. Also, the atrial ﬁbrillation group excluded patients with a history of hypertension before their diagnosis. After adjustment for age and sex, patients with atrial ﬂutter had a higher incidence of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack than patients with atrial ﬁbrillation (hazard ratio, 2.6 [CI, 1.2 to 5.3]; P ϭ 0.011). Moreover, when nonhypertensive patients with atrial ﬂutter were compared with patients with atrial ﬁbrillation, the rate of stroke or transient ischemic attack did not differ (hazard ratio, 1.9 [CI, 0.85 to 4.4]; P ϭ 0.119).
DISCUSSION In our study, 32% of patients with atrial ﬂutter had a
cerebrovascular event at 10-year follow-up. Compared with the age- and sex-adjusted expected thromboembolic rates, patients with atrial ﬂutter experienced a statistically higher risk. Also, the rate of thromboembolism was higher in the patients with atrial ﬂutter than in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. This observation, in part, is probably due to inclusion of patients with controlled hypertension in the atrial ﬂutter group. However, when nonhypertensive patients with atrial ﬂutter were compared with the incident cohort, there was a higher incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial ﬂutter. This suggests that atrial ﬂutter, even without hypertension, carries a risk similar to that of lone atrial ﬁbrillation and patients with atrial ﬂutter and controlled hypertension are at even higher risk for thromboembolic events.
Atrial Flutter and Subsequent Atrial Fibrillation Most patients with atrial ﬂutter (56%) developed atrial
ﬁbrillation within a mean (ϮSD) of 5 Ϯ 6 years, similar to

previous reports (3). Moreover, because atrial ﬁbrillation frequently is asymptomatic (4), the number of patients with atrial ﬂutter and subsequent atrial ﬁbrillation was probably underestimated. The ﬁnding that advanced age, female sex, diabetes, and hypertension seem to predispose patients with atrial ﬂutter to atrial ﬁbrillation is striking because these are known risk factors for thromboembolism in atrial ﬁbrillation (5).
Although catheter ablation is an effective treatment for atrial ﬂutter and has become common (6), it is unclear whether ablation will decrease the risk for future atrial ﬁbrillation. Therefore, patients undergoing atrial ﬂutter ablation should continue to be evaluated to exclude the development of ﬁbrillation.
Limitations Our observations and conclusions should be inter-
preted in the light of the limitations imposed by the study design. Selection of study patients was not random, but the inclusion of consecutive patients minimized selection bias. We cannot exclude covert coronary disease in such an elderly sample. We also included patients with controlled hypertension and diabetes. Although the total number of patients was small, follow-up was long.
Conclusions Patients with lone atrial ﬂutter have an increased risk
for thromboembolism. These ﬁndings support the use of anticoagulation for all patients with atrial ﬂutter who are older than 65 years of age. Atrial ﬁbrillation develops in most patients with atrial ﬂutter. Further studies are needed to determine whether catheter ablation alters the high rate of subsequent atrial ﬁbrillation.
