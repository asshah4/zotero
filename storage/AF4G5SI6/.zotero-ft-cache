Abstract 
Aphasia is an acquired disorder of language resulting from focal or diffuse injury to the dominant cerebral hemisphere. Investigation of aphasia provides insight into the complex organization of higher cerebral function. Major motor aphasia is characterized by effortful, dysfluent speech with relatively spared comprehension and is localizable primarily to anterior cortical structures. By contrast, aphasia that produces predominantly sensory features is manifested by fluent, often nonsensical speech littered with paraphasic errors and is characterized by poor comprehension. Major sensory aphasias are localized primarily to posterior parietal and temporal regions of the brain. The minor aphasic syndromes such as conduction aphasia and the transcortical aphasias are produced by anatomically more variable lesions and often appear in the setting of recovery of the major aphasias. In this article, the salient features of all the aphasic syndromes are described in anatomical and clinical detail with reference to groundwork historical observations as well as the modern imaging techniques that have futher advanced our understanding of acquired language dysfunction.

Abstract 
Twenty three patients with past or present evidence of aphasia following either stroke ( n = 19) or head trauma ( n = 4) were given the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination in order to classify their aphasia type and determine their language deficit at least three months postonset of their neurological disorder. The location and extent of brain lesions identified from computerized tomographic (C.T.) scans taken in the acute stage and, wherever possible, in the chronic stage ( n = 7) were correlated with the type of aphasia. Lesions associated with global, Wernicke's, Broca's, conduction, and anomic aphasia are described and discussed in relation to the findings of previously reported clinico-C.T. scan correlation studies. The value of the acute stage C.T. scan as a predictor of long-term language deficits is discussed.

Abstract 
It was the object of this study to investigate whether the comprehension deficit of Wernicke aphasics can be attributable to a selective deficit in phonemic hearing or phonemic discrimination as suggested by Luria. The ability to make phonemic discriminations between real words and nonsense syllables in relation to level of auditory comprehension was compared in 25 aphasic patients: 6 Broca's, 6 Mixed Anteriors, 6 Wernicke's, and 7 unclassified Posterior aphasics. The aphasics' ability to discriminate other phonological contrasts such as syllable structure and phoneme order was also tested. The subject's task was to indicate if two auditorily presented stimuli were the same or different. Results indicated that Mixed Anterior aphasics, who had only moderate comprehension deficits, performed worse on all phonological discriminations. Wernicke aphasics, with much more severe comprehension deficit, were less impaired in the present task. However, only the posterior aphasics (including Wernickes) had more difficulty in discriminating place of articulation than voicing contrasts. This deficit was interpreted as reflecting an impairment in linguistic encoding of speech sounds in the auditory association areas. It was concluded that a deficit in phonemic hearing cannot account for the comprehension deficit of Wernicke's aphasics. 
 
Résumé 
L'objet de cette étude était de rechercher si le déficit de la compréhension de l'aphasie de Wernicke peut être attribuéà un déficit sélectif de l'audition ou de la discrimination phonémique tel qu'il a été suggéré par Luria. On a comparé la capacité de réaliser des discriminations phonémiques entre des mots réels et des syllables sans sens par rapport au niveau de compréhension auditive chez 25 malades aphasiques : aphasies de Broca : 6, aphasies antérieures mixtes : 6, aphasies de Wernicke : 6 et aphasies postérieures non classifiées : 7. On a aussi examiné la capacité des aphasiques à discriminer d'autres contrastes phonologiques tels que les structures syllabiques et l'ordre des phonémes. Le sujet devait indiquer si 2 stimulus auditifs étaient identiques ou différents. Les résultats indiquent que les aphasies antérieures mixtes avec seulement des déficits modérés de la compréhension ont les performances les plus basses sur toutes les discriminations phonologiques. Les aphasiques de Wernicke qui ont des déficits de la compréhension beaucoup plus graves étaient moins perturbés sur ces épreuves. Cependant, seuls les aphasiques postérieurs (y compris les aphasiques de Wernicke) ont plus de difficultés à discriminer le lieu de l'articulation que les contrastes de voisement. On interpréte ces déficits comme un trouble de l'encodage linguistique de sons verbaux au niveau des aires auditives d 'association. On en conclut qu'un déficit de l'audition phonémique ne peut pas rendre compte du déficit de compréhension rencontré dans l'aphasie de Wernicke. 
Zusammenfassung 
 
Ziel dieser Arbeit was es zu untersuchen, ob das Verstehensdefizit der Wernicke Aphasiker auf ein selektives Defizit beim phonemischen Hören oder der phonemischen Diskriminationsfähigkeit zurückführbar sei, wie Luria behauptet hat. Die Fähigkeit, phonemisch zwischen richtigen Wörtern und sinnlosen Silben zu diskriminieren, wurde bei 25 Aphasikern in Bezug auf das Niveau des auditiven Erkennens verglichen: bei 6 Broca's, 6 gemischten Praecentralen, 6 Wernicke's und 7 unklassifizierten postcentralen Aphasikern. Die Fähigkeit der Aphasiker, andere phonologische Kontraste wie Silbenstruktur und Phonemreihenfolge zu diskriminieren wurde auch untersucht. Aufgabe des Probanden war es anzugeben, ob zwei auditorisch gegebene Stimuli gleich oder verschieden waren. Die Ergebnisse zeigten an, daβ die gemischten Vorderhirn-Aphasiker (praecentrale A.), die nur mäβige Verstehensdefizite aufwiesen, bei allen phonologischen Diskriminationsleistungen schlechter abschnitten. Die Wernicke Aphasiker, mit viel schwereren Verstehensausfällen, waren weniger leistungsgemindert bei dieser Aufgabe. Jedoch hatten nur die postzentralen Aphasiker (einschl. der Wernicke Patienten) mehr Schwierigkeiten nach der Artikulationsstelle Laute zu unterscheiden als nach ihrer Stimmhaftigkeit. Dieses Defizit wurde in dem Sinne interpretiert, daβ es eine Beeinträchtigung der auditorischen Associationsareae beim Encodieren von Sprachlauten widerspiegelt. Es wurde der Schluβ gezogen, daβ ein Defizit beim phonemischen Hören nicht für die Komprehensionsausfälle der Wernicke-Aphasien verantwortlich gemacht werden kann.

Abstract 
Paralexic speech errors were examined during the oral reading of sentences for 12 right-handed adults, including four Broca's aphasics, four Wernicke's aphasics and four patients with unilateral right-hemisphere lesions. A category system of error types was developed, and 129 errors were analyzed in terms of identifiable linguistic components, operating in isolation as well as interactively. The two aphasic groups produced a variety of errors, whereas the right-hemisphere group produced very few in number and type. Broca's aphasics committed more morphological errors than did Wernicke's aphasics, whereas Wernicke's aphasics committed more graphophonemic-neologistic errors than did Broca's.

Abstract 
This study was designed to determine if perceptual phonological analysis would reveal distinctions between patients with apraxia of speech and patients with phonemic paraphasic speech. Test findings from 10 Broca's aphasics with apraxia of speech were compared to findings from 10 paraphasic speakers (5 conduction and 5 Wernicke's aphasics). Several marked differences were revealed. Predominant locus of errors and relative difficulty of different classes of phonemic segments were significant discriminators. There was a nonsignificant trend for substituted phonemes to be further from target phonetically in the paraphasic patients. In addition, the two groups showed certain consistent differences in the types of errors they produced. Apraxic patients produced many errors of transitionalization, while sequencing errors were more typical of the patients with phonemic paraphasia. The findings are interpreted in relation to a neuropsychological model of speech. It is suggested that phonemic paraphasia represents a breakdown mainly in the retrieval of phonological word patterns, while apraxia of speech is characterized predominantly by a disturbance in encoding phonological patterns into appropriate speech movements.

Abstract 
Aphasias are disturbances of language following diseases of the brain. Early approaches to describing aphasias identified the modality of language use that was affected—speaking, understanding spoken language, reading, and/or writing. To limited extent, these early descriptions included observations about the nature of the linguistic impairments in patients, such as whether a disturbance of speech affected grammatical forms or content words. This approach was related to a model of where the processing of speaking, understanding spoken language, reading, and writing simple words were located in the brain, and has given rise to a set of aphasic syndromes that are widely recognized by clinicians today. However, this approach did not capture the details of the linguistic impairments in patients. Modern descriptions of aphasic patients have taken major steps towards this goal. Many highly specific deficits have been described in individual patients. This research has led to better understanding of how language processing is organized and how it breaks down. However, the goal of understanding the exact relation between language processing operations and brain structures still remains to be achieved.

Abstract 
An acquired disorder of language is known as aphasia (or dysphasia). Symptoms can include impairments of object naming, word finding, syntax, and comprehension. Some patients have a sparse, labored output; others have unusually voluminous but uninformative speech. The nature of the aphasia varies from patient to patient and reflects the principal lesion site within a distributed left-hemisphere language network. Aphasia can start suddenly when caused by cerebrovascular accidents or progresses relentlessly when caused by neurodegeneration. A neurodegenerative disease that selectively impairs language is known as primary progressive aphasia.

Abstract 
Functional brain imaging studies examining the time course of post-stroke neural reorganization show that aphasia recovery is aided by recruitment of homologous contralateral (usually right hemisphere) cortex early after onset. Findings are mixed as to whether right hemisphere participation contributes to the improved processing of language, attention, or memory, and as to whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive recovery strategy. Aphasias with best recovery show restored activity in spared left hemisphere language zones, with or without persistent right hemisphere enhancement. Studies evaluating intensive direct or computer-assisted behavioral interventions and a variety of pharmacological treatments provide evidence that functional recovery accompanied by neural reorganization is possible even in chronic aphasia.

Abstract 
The present article treats the neurolinguistic processing of sublexical units in the brain, and more specifically in the brains of individuals with aphasia. We first examine the growing evidence that, when sub-lexical units are processed in productive and perceptual language behavior, there is no single cerebral area of activity but rather a mosaic of activity measured by uptakes in cerebral metabolism. Recent PET and fMRI studies of the prosodic counterpart of the phoneme – the toneme of tone languages such as Thai and Chinese – have demonstrated important linguistic/perceptual functions of left frontal opercular regions in the perception of tone. We highlight motor-sensory function in both Broca's area and Wernicke's area and the evidence that contradicts a strict posterior left sensory vs. anterior left motor schema. This, in turn, provides compelling support for previous views that there is a strong acoustic/sensory force in speech production as well as a strong articulatory/motoric force in speech perception. We then turn our attention to recent phonological studies of the phonetic/phonological principle of sonority, syllable constituency and metrics to evaluate descriptions of segmental paraphasia in fluent vs. non-fluent disorders. This is followed by our recent evaluation of how different types of recovery patterns can be discerned in the amelioration of patients, all of whom produce neologisms in the early stages of their aphasias. We consider evidence that demonstrates distinct linguistic realignment throughout the resolution of neologistic jargon production, indicating that, initially in the more acute stages of the aphasia, the neologisms of different patients can be produced through distinct error processes. The issues revolve around differing abilities of lexical access in the acute and chronic stages of the aphasias.
