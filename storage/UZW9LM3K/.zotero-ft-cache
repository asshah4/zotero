COMPENDIUM ON BASIC MODELS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Animal Models to Study Cardiac Arrhythmias
Daniel J. Blackwell ,* Jeffrey Schmeckpeper ,* Bjorn C. Knollmann
ABSTRACT: Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for 10% to 15% of all deaths. Although most arrhythmias are due to acquired heart disease, inherited channelopathies and cardiomyopathies disproportionately affect children and young adults. Arrhythmogenesis is complex, involving anatomic structure, ion channels and regulatory proteins, and the interplay between cells in the conduction system, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and the immune system. Animal models of arrhythmia are powerful tools for studying not only molecular and cellular mechanism of arrhythmogenesis but also more complex mechanisms at the whole heart level, and for testing therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes basic and clinical arrhythmia mechanisms followed by an in-depth review of published animal models of genetic and acquired arrhythmia disorders.

Cardiac arrhythmias affect ≈2% of community-dwelling adults, with an incidence of ≈0.5% per year.1 Arrhythmias can manifest as relatively benign entities, such as atrial and ventricular premature beats, or as life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), which can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD), accounting for 10-15% of all deaths in the United States. Atrial fibrillation (AF) accounts for the greatest arrhythmia burden and is associated with stroke and heart failure, fueling huge health care costs. Arrhythmia treatment approaches focused on risk factor reduction, drug therapy, catheter ablation, device implantation, or a combination of these strategies has improved morbidity and mortality over the last 20 years, but treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs is often ineffective or increases mortality long term.2,3 A more thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of arrhythmia initiation and maintenance is important for improving clinical outcomes.
The mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis at the cellular level involve ion channels and electrogenic transporters that are altered via biogenic (synthesis, processing, trafficking, and degradation), biochemical (posttranslation modification, phosphorylation), and biophysical (gating, permeation) processes (reviewed here in study by Delisle et al4). The interplay between ion channels and

transporters controls the action potential duration (APD), effective refractory period, and Ca2+ cycling to coordinate excitation-contraction coupling and normal myocyte function; dysregulation leads to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical activity.5 Structural and hemodynamic parameters contribute to further cardiac remodeling, increasing the risk for arrhythmia development and maintenance.6–9
To study underlying arrhythmia mechanisms and evaluate treatment approaches, multiple in vitro systems and in vivo models have been developed. This review focuses on animal models that have informed our understanding of arrhythmia pathophysiology and have been used to develop new therapeutic approaches. An ideal model would recapitulate human anatomic, electrophysiological, and hemodynamic parameters. Currently, no single model can accomplish this feat. However, animal models have enabled the discovery of new treatment strategies for humans with genetic arrhythmia disorders. For example, mouse models demonstrated the efficacy of flecainide in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia10 and mexiletine in long QT type 3.11 When choosing an animal model of cardiac arrhythmia, researchers must consider the most appropriate model to address a specific scientific question based on cost, complexity, ease of handling, access to diagnostic and surgical expertise, and the ability for genetic modification.

Here, we provide the reader with a brief overview of basic and clinical cardiac electrophysiology, followed by an in-depth review of existing animal models of cardiac arrhythmias. Animal models are classified as either genetic (ie, arrhythmia risk caused by gene mutation) or acquired (ie, arrhythmia risk caused by nongenetic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction, metabolic abnormalities, or cardiac hypertrophy).

PRINCIPLES OF CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY The Cardiac Conduction System
Normal heart rhythm is generated and regulated in the specialized cardiac conduction system, which consists

of the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, and the HIS-Purkinje system (Figure 1). Electrical impulses are initiated in the sinoatrial node and spread through the atria to the AV node. After a slight delay (0.12–0.20 seconds), excitation continues through the bundle of His, the right and left bundle branches, and finally the Purkinje fibers, which then excite the working myocardium. The delay in the AV node allows the atria to contract earlier than the ventricles and provides adequate time for optimal ventricular filling.12 The specialized cells within the sinoatrial node, AV node, and His-Purkinje system are capable of spontaneous depolarization that is regulated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Conduction through the heart depends on electrical coupling between cells, which is mediated by gap junctions.
Species Differences in the Cardiac Action Potential and Cardiac Ca2+ Handling
The cardiac action potential (AP) results from the opening and closing of ion channels and electrogenic transporters in the plasma membrane of individual cardiomyocytes (see study by Varró et al13 for details). Figure 2 illustrates AP wave forms and underlying membrane currents for ventricular cardiomyocytes of humans and mice.
When choosing an animal model for arrhythmia research, it is important to recognize species differences in cardiac AP and membrane currents, which are the result of species-specific expression of ion channels and transporters. For example, unlike humans, mice and rats have a low AP plateau at ≈−40 mV membrane potential (Figure 2). This is primarily the result of differential expression in repolarizing transient K-currents, as illustrated in Figure 2. On the other hand, rabbits and guinea pigs have a more positive AP plateau analogous to humans.14 For a more detailed comparison of ionic currents in different species, the reader is referred to here.15
As with the AP, there are important species differences in cardiac Ca2+ handling. For example, mice and rats primarily (>90%) utilize sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)mediated Ca2+ cycling (via the cardiac ryanodine receptor [RyR2] and the SR Ca uptake pump [SERCA2a]) for excitation-contraction coupling, whereas in humans, dogs, and rabbits the SR accounts for ≈65%, with the remainder coming from outside the cell via the L-type Ca channel (CaV1.2) and the NCX (Na/Ca exchanger).16 For a more detailed comparison of species differences in Ca2+ handling, the reader is referred to here.17
Pathophysiology of Cardiac Arrhythmias
The main mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis can be divided into either abnormal impulse generation or abnormal impulse propagation. Disorders of impulse generation and propagation, regulation of the AP duration, and cellular

substrates can all contribute to 3 categories of arrhythmias; enhanced automaticity, triggered ectopic beats, and reentry. Each arrhythmia category is explained briefly below. A more detailed review can be found in here.5
Automaticity Automaticity is the ability of cells to generate their own AP.18 The intrinsic depolarization rate of the sinoatrial node is faster than the rest of the cardiac conduction system and overdrives pacemaking in the AV node and His-Purkinje system. However, automaticity in the AV node and His-Purkinje system can become dominant in sinoatrial nodal dysfunction. The sinoatrial node is more sensitive to increased sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, leading to sinus tachycardia and bradycardia, respectively. Under normal conditions, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes display either no or very slow intrinsic depolarization that are easily suppressed by the faster, coordinated impulses from the sinoatrial node through the conduction system. Increased automaticity in the atria can lead to focal and multifocal atrial tachycardia and AF. Specifically, the pulmonary vein sleeve, where the left atria myocytes transition to the tunica

media of the pulmonary veins, is known to harbor tissue with increased automaticity,19 and is a target for catheter based ablation by pulmonary vein isolation for AT and AF. Increased automaticity in the ventricle is less common but can lead to VT or accelerated idioventricular rhythms.
Afterdepolarizations and Triggered Arrhythmia Triggered arrhythmias are because of spontaneous membrane depolarization of atrial or ventricular myocytes that precede the next sinus beat. Membrane depolarizations that occur within or follow the cardiac AP are referred to as afterdepolarizations. Two classes are traditionally recognized: early and delayed. An early afterdepolarization (EAD) interrupts the repolarization during phase 2 or early phase 3 of the cardiac AP, whereas a delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) occurs after full repolarization in Phase 4. When an EAD or DAD brings the membrane to its threshold potential, a spontaneous AP is referred to as a triggered response. These triggered events can give rise to premature extrasystolic complexes in the atria or the ventricle (PVCs), precipitating tachyarrhythmias. In general, any unbalanced increased inward current (ie, gain-of-function

Note the differences in action potential shape, which is caused primarily by differences in ionic currents circled in red.

mutations in Na+ or Ca2+ channels) or decreased outward currents (ie, loss-of-function mutations in K+ channels) will depolarize the cell membrane and can lead to EADs or DADs.20 Specifically, a major cause of triggered arrhythmia is spontaneous RyR2-mediated SR Ca2+ release, driving inward Na+ current via the NCX, leading to EAD and in particular DAD formation, which are important cellular arrhythmia mechanisms in AF, VT, and SCD.21
Reentrant Arrhythmia In reentry, a group of myocardial cells that are not activated during the early stage of depolarization can resume excitability before the impulse vanishes. In this situation, they may connect to re-excite zones that were previously depolarized but were recovered from the refractory period of the initial wave. Two crucial factors predisposing reentry are prolonged conduction time and shortened refractory period. Reentry is the dominant mechanism of arrhythmias in the clinical setting and occurs due to anatomic and functional factors.22
Classification of Clinical Arrhythmias
Clinically, cardiac arrhythmias are usually classified as bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias (Figure 1). Both types can reduce cardiac output, resulting in hypotension

and ultimately can cause death but have different underlying mechanisms. Figure 1 lists the major clinical types of brady and tachyarrhythmias. Briefly, bradyarrhythmias reduce the heart rate either by reducing spontaneous depolarization within the sinoatrial node, slowing conduction through the conduction system, or increasing parasympathetic tone. Sinus bradycardia, sinus node exit block, sinus arrest, and asystole are caused by dysfunction within the sinus node itself, due to destruction of the pacemaker cells, fibrosis of the sinoatrial node, or increased parasympathetic tone. AV nodal block prolongs the conduction above, within or below the AV node. Depending on the severity of AV block, it is classified as first-degree, second-degree, or complete (third-degree) heart block (Figure 1).
Tachyarrhythmias are accelerated rhythms that originate from either above (supraventricular tachycardia) or below the AV node (ventricular arrhythmia). The most common supraventricular tachycardias are sinus tachycardia and AF. Premature atrial contractions and AT are commonly caused by automatic foci within the atria. Reentrant atrial arrhythmias include atrial flutter, AV nodal reentry tachycardia, and AV reciprocating tachycardia. Atrial flutter is a macroreentrant loop, typically involving the tricuspid annulus limited by anatomic

barriers such as the superior and inferior cava veins, the coronary sinus and crista terminalis.23 AV nodal reentry tachycardia is a microreentry related to differences in the refractory period of the slow and fast pathway within the AV node.24 AV reciprocating tachycardia, also known as preexcitation syndrome, occurs due to the presence of an accessory pathway, most notably the Bundle of Kent leading to Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, which can prematurely conduct impulses between the atria and ventricles.
Ventricular arrhythmias include premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, and VF. PVCs are single premature beats due to EADs or DADs in myocardial cells and benign, unless they trigger VT or VF. VT and VF are usually reentrant arrhythmias, and if not treated rapidly, can lead to sudden cardiac death. While a majority of cases of VT are because of reentry around the scar in structural heart disease, 10% of VT occurs in structurally normal hearts due to nonreentrant mechanisms such as catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (CPVT), fascicular VT, left or right outflow tract VT, mitral and tricuspid annular VT, long QT, and Brugada syndrome.25
Animal Models
An important consideration for selecting an animal model to study cardiac arrhythmias is how closely the species resembles human cardiac physiology. Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster both develop heart tubes and have been primarily used to screen gene function and examine development and cardiac structure. Zebrafish have a 2 chambered heart with some similarities in AP electrophysiology to humans and provide advantages for understanding cardiogenesis. Zebrafish embryos are transparent, enabling optical viewing, fluorescent protein expression, and optogenetic pacing; they have large clutch sizes with a rapid embryonic stage lasting only 3 to 4 days postfertilization; are amenable to drug absorption; and genes are easily manipulated. Mouse hearts are anatomically similar to human hearts with 4 chambers and comparable development,26 albeit differences in coronary anatomy.27 However, there are major differences in heart rate, cardiac AP, and membrane currents (Figure 2). These differences influence ion channel function, refractoriness, and arrhythmia susceptibility. In addition, the small size of the mouse heart may contribute to the frequently observed self-termination of reentrant arrhythmias or lack of spontaneous arrhythmias in many models. Nevertheless, the mouse has been the primary animal model for cardiac arrhythmia studies of inherited cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, and many models faithfully capture cardiac disease. Rabbits more closely recapitulate the human AP compared with rats and mice. The rabbit AP has a sustained Ca2+ current-driven plateau phase, and the major repolarizing K+ currents are similar to humans. Rabbit heart size and

beating rate is between that of mice and humans. Dogs, pigs, and goats have a similar cardiac anatomy, size, and beating rate (slightly higher in dogs) as humans. Their cardiac electrophysiology, APs, and ionic currents are all fairly comparable to humans, and their primary limitations as an animal model for research come from their cost, size, and time to breed and reach sexual maturity.
ANIMAL MODELS OF GENETIC ARRHYTHMIA DISORDERS
Genetic arrhythmia disorders are either caused by or associated with identifiable gene mutations. Genetic arrhythmia syndromes can be subdivided into channelopathies without structural heart disease (eg, CPVT, long QT syndrome [LQTS], Brugada Syndrome) and genetic arrhythmia syndromes associated with structural heart disease (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM], action potential duration [ARVC], AF). Tables 1 and 2 list published animal models of genetic arrhythmia syndromes. Most animal arrhythmia models are mice, given the ease of genetic manipulation. Despite differences between rodent and human cardiac electrophysiology (Figure 2), mouse models have enabled the study of human genetic diseases, identification of pathogenic mutations, characterization of disease pathophysiology, and testing/screening of therapeutic interventions. Advances in gene editing technology such as CRISPR/Cas9 have provided faster, easier, and cheaper methods to develop genetic models in animals and cells. Compared with cellular models such as human-induced pluripotent stem cells, animal models provide a distinct advantage in modeling cardiac arrhythmias where the anatomy of the heart is relevant.217 In the following section, each of the major genetic arrhythmia syndromes are introduced, followed by examples of animal models that have informed disease pathophysiology and treatment approaches.
Channelopathies
Channelopathies are caused by mutations in ion channel genes or genes that regulate ion channels and generate arrhythmia risk in the structurally normal heart. However, overlap syndromes caused by mutations in channelopathy genes (eg, SCN5A) can also be associated with alterations in cardiac structure, which are discussed in Section genetic arrhythmia syndromes associated with structural heart disease.
Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia CPVT is characterized by arrhythmogenesis evoked by elevated catecholamines during stress or exercise. CPVT is caused by gain-of-function mutations in proteins that constitute the intracellular Ca2+ release unit of the SR. These mutations result in spontaneous Ca2+

release from RYR2 SR Ca2+ release channels, raising diastolic Ca2+ and generating membrane depolarizations and delayed afterdepolarizations via Ca2+ extrusion through the electrogenic Na+- Ca2+ exchanger. Pathological mutations in RYR2 make up more than half of identified CPVT cases and are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in regulatory partners of RyR2 are rarer and include calsequestrin, calmodulin, and triadin. Evidence suggests that KCNJ2 mutations may also be involved in CPVT.
Mice have been the primary animal model for studying CPVT and have been valuable not only to establish arrhythmia pathophysiology but also to identify new drug therapy that proved efficacious in humans.218 At least 1 attempt to generate a rabbit model overexpressing human RYR2-R4497C was unsuccessful, likely due to the selected promotor and size of the transgene.219 The first animal model of CPVT generated was an RYR2R4496C± knock-in mouse,28 which had exercise- and catecholamine-inducible ventricular arrhythmias. Since then, several mouse models have been designed that carry RYR2 mutations identified from patients with CPVT (see Table 1). When loss-of-function mutations are combined with gain-of-function mutations, mice are protected from CPVT.33 Identifying the pathogenicity of specific mutations is important because RYR2 mutations are implicated in several other arrhythmia disorders, as detailed below. Interestingly, a RYR2-exon3 deletion was identified in patients with a severe form of CPVT, but the corresponding mouse model failed to reproduce the CPVT phenotype.36
Cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, leading to loss of function. Casq2 serves as a high-capacity Ca2+ buffer

in the SR and regulates RYR2 gating. In the mouse, CASQ2 deletion causes a severe exercise- and/or catecholamine-induced arrhythmia phenotype consistent with patients lacking Casq2 expression. Observations from CASQ2 mouse models carrying mutations identified from patients show these commonly lead to loss of Casq2 expression in the heart. Recent evidence, however, suggests that Casq2 mutations could also be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.220 A knock-in mouse model expressing Casq2-K180R± reported catecholamine-induced arrhythmias validating this inheritance pattern.221
Triadin is another protein in the SR Ca2+ release unit where autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported in patients with CPVT. When triadin was knocked out in mice, they developed substantial ultrastructural changes in the junctional SR and reduced expression of proteins comprising the Ca2+ release unit, leading to catecholamine-inducible arrhythmias.46 Calmodulin genes (CALM1/2/3) encode 3 identical proteins (CaM) and some mutations are associated with CPVT.222 Zebrafish models have been generated to examine the pathogenesis of overexpressing CALM mutations, and they have successfully demonstrated cardiac arrhythmias (Table 1). Finally, KCNJ2 loss of function mutations, which commonly have been linked to the Anderson-Tawil Syndrome and cause reduced IK1 current (see section Long QT syndrome), have also been identified in patients with CPVT. A knock-in mouse carrying KCNJ2− R67Q± had significant evoked arrhythmias without any QT prolongation (Table 1).
The CASQ2 knockout (KO) mouse is an excellent model to investigate CPVT. It has a severe and highly penetrant phenotype, something not always observed

with RYR2 mouse models of CPVT (Table 1). The age of onset for CPVT is only a few weeks old and mice have spontaneous arrhythmias under normal housing conditions.38 CASQ2 KO mice were used to establish proof of principle for the efficacy of gene-therapy in CPVT.223 In what may be the only example of its kind for an arrhythmia syndrome, the CASQ2 KO mouse was used to establish the therapeutic efficacy of an existing FDA-approved drug, flecainide, in CPVT.218 CASQ2 KO mice were instrumental to demonstrate that in vivo, RYR2 block is the principal mechanism of flecainide’s antiarrhythmic action.224 Since its discovery in CASQ2 KO mice, flecainide has become the standard of care for preventing arrhythmias in CPVT patients when betablockers are insufficient.225,226
CASQ2 KO mice have also recently been used to establish a novel tissue mechanism responsible for ventricular ectopy in CPVT (Figure 3). To determine the cellular origin of ventricular arrhythmias in CPVT, Blackwell et al41 used conditional murine models with Casq2 expression only in ventricular myocardium or in the specialized conduction system, utilizing the contactin-2 promoter to drive Cre expression and control tissue-specific Casq2 expression. CPVT occurred when Casq2 was deleted in the ventricular myocardium but still expressed in the conduction system. Moreover, catecholamine challenge did not elicit any arrhythmias when Casq2 was deleted in the conduction system but still expressed in the ventricular myocardium. Additional experiments determined that the subendocardial ventricular myocardium juxtaposed to Purkinje fibers is the only cellular source for focal ventricular arrhythmias in CPVT. To understand why that was the case, in silico modeling demonstrated an intriguing phenomenon whereby subthreshold DADs in ventricular myocardium elicit full-blown APs in the conduction system to generate arrhythmias, identifying the Purkinje-myocardial junction as the tissue origin of ventricular ectopy in CPVT (Figure 3). This discovery could shape treatment and may be critical to our understanding of arrhythmogenesis in other ventricular arrhythmia syndromes where DADs are the cellular arrhythmia mechanism.
Calcium Release Deficiency Syndrome
Whereas RYR2 gain-of-function mutations have been associated with CPVT, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, and AF, loss-of-function mutations in RYR2 can cause an arrhythmia syndrome recently termed Ca2+ release deficiency syndrome (CRDS).49 In patients with CRDS, exercise stress tests do not provoke arrhythmias. Consequently, this syndrome can escape clinical diagnosis and often presents as sudden cardiac death. In CRDS, arrhythmias are thought to develop because of electrophysiological remodeling. Given the substantial number of benign RYR2 mutations observed, predicting pathogenicity without in vitro or in vivo examination is challenging. CRDS has only been recently described, but 1 knock-in mouse model was generated carrying the

patient-specific RYR2-D4646A± mutant allele.49 Exercise and catecholamine challenge did not invoke arrhythmias, as predicted. Importantly, this animal model enabled the authors to establish a burst pacing protocol that induced arrhythmias, supporting a possible new clinical diagnostic tool, which was recently confirmed in a clinical study. A previously reported loss-of-function mutation, RYR2-A4860G±, was identified in a patient with idiopathic VF and subsequently knocked-in to a mouse, but arrhythmias were not reported in vivo.48 Ex vivo hearts did develop VF in response to isoproterenol but had no arrhythmias in the presence of the RyR2 agonist caffeine. These data hint that this RYR2 loss-of-function mutation may be part of the calcium release deficiency syndrome. Prior work on RYR2 has focused on gain-offunction mutations. CRDS is a relatively new syndrome and animal models provide an opportunity to advance our understanding of CRDS pathophysiology and determine the impact of loss-of-function mutations.
Long QT Syndrome Congenital LQTS often presents as a multiorgan syndrome caused by mutations in proteins responsible for the repolarization of the heart and can cause seizures, syncope, arrhythmia, and sudden death. Alterations in repolarization manifest as prolongation of the AP and, consequently, the QT interval, predisposing the heart to EAD, DAD, and reentrant circuits. Ca2+, Na+, and many K+ channels play a role in cardiac repolarization; accordingly, the genes involved in this syndrome vary and LQTS can be inherited in autosomal dominant or recessive forms. LQTS is traditionally described as a distinct disease manifestation; however, long QT intervals are observed in many overlap syndromes (see Table 1). Approximately 80% of LQTS cases are caused by mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNH2, with SCN5A constituting 7% to 10% of cases.227 It should be reiterated that the currents responsible for mouse and human repolarization are quite different (Figure 2), and mice are inadequate to model human disease involving mutations in delayed rectifier K+ channels (eg, LQT1, LQT2).
An aspect of understanding LQT pathogenesis is the observed sex differences in patients, such as QT interval, the onset of cardiac events, and sudden death.228,229 Animal models allow for significant insight into these investigations since most in vitro models fail to capture the hormonal factors that influence development and regulation. It is noteworthy that sexual dimorphism in QT is not captured by mouse models and may require other animal models such as rabbits.230,231 Estradiol treatment in ovariectomized rabbits led to prolongation of the QT interval and changes in proteins responsible for repolarization, whereas dihydrotestosterone did not.232 Another study in rabbits recapitulated findings in patients showing that QT interval was more prolonged in females following treatment with erythromycin.233

LQT1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in KCNQ1 (Kv7.1). Knockout of KCNQ1 in mice leads to characteristics of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, causing deafness and prolonged QT interval.50 Other models have examined distinct mutations with varying phenotypes; however, caution should be used when reviewing the mouse LQT1 literature. Rabbits are a much better model for examining human-like mechanisms of altered repolarization. However, only 1 transgenic rabbit model is reported, which carries cardiac-specific overexpression of KCNQ1-Y315S, leading to LQT and inducible EADs and VT with sympathetic stimulation.53
LQT2 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in KCNH2 (Kv11.1). In contrast to humans, KCNH2 contributes little to repolarization in mice (Figure 2). As such, mouse models are not realistic for modeling LQT2 and should not be used. A rabbit transgenic model was generated with cardiac-specific overexpression of KCNH2-G628S and developed LQT, spontaneous PVT, and sudden death. Arguably, the most interesting LQT2 model is the work in zebrafish.56 In 1 study, the endogenous ortholog of hERG (zERG) was knocked down using morpholinos and then various hERG mutants were expressed in its place. The phenotype data (prolonged APD and/or 2:1 AV block) correctly identified 39/39 pathogenic mutants and 9/10 nonpathogenic polymorphisms. Further work using this model could establish the pathogenicity of other variants of uncertain significance.
LQT3 is caused by gain-of-function mutations in SCN5A (Nav1.5). Several mouse models have been generated that recapitulate the LQT phenotype. Both the SCN5A-ΔKPQ/+ and SCN5A-ΔQKP/+ mouse models report many characteristic phenotypes such as prolonged QT interval, a more pronounced T wave, prolonged APD, arrhythmias, and sudden death, which make them suitable for examining LQT3 mechanisms and pathogenesis.57,58 A successful bench-to-bedside study, conducted in ventricular myocytes isolated from guinea pigs, demonstrated that mexiletine restored the APD in cells treated with the Na+ channel inactivation inhibitor, anthopleurin.61 Mexiletine is now used routinely in the treatment of patients with LQT3. In rare cases, patients have been identified linking LQTS with mutations in the beta accessory proteins for SCN5A. An SCN1B knockout mouse was generated and had long QT, bradycardia, and delayed repolarization79; interestingly, it was found that these mice had increased Na+ channel expression. Nav1.5 channel gating was unaffected, but peak and persistent currents were increased in isolated cardiomyocytes.
Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare LQTS associated with physical abnormalities and hypokalemic periodic paralysis and is primarily caused by loss of function mutations in KCNJ2 (Kir2.1), resulting in reduced IK1 current. Neonatal (1 day old) KCNJ2 knockout mice were characterized by long QT and bradycardia, before dying from complete cleft palate and inability to feed.73

A more useful arrhythmia phenotype—LQT and spontaneous VT—was observed in the KCNJ2-T75R cardiacspecific overexpression mouse model.74
The remaining LQTS types result from mutations in K+ channels, Ca2+ channels, and key regulators of ion channel function (Table 1). The ankyrin-B syndrome is characterized as an overlap syndrome, with long QT, sinus node dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, exerciseinduced arrhythmia, VF, and VT. The ankyrin-B knockout mouse demonstrated long QT and sinus node dysfunction62; however, a more severe and faithful phenotype was reported in heterozygous mice, capturing many of the same observations from humans.63 KCNE1 knockout mice developed long QT, but only when heart rate deceleration occurred.70 A transgenic rabbit model overexpressing dominant negative KCNE1-G52R developed long QT and increased susceptibility to drug-induced arrhythmia by accelerating IKs and IKr deactivation kinetics.69 This model could be useful for examining the proarrhythmic liability of drugs. CACNA1C (Cav1.2) gainof-function mutations cause LQTS that can be associated with extracardiac manifestations known as Timothy syndrome. In mice, CACNA1C knockout is embryonic lethal, but heterozygous mice survived without any cardiac phenotypes. Cardiac-specific overexpression of the G406R mutation in mice led to long QTc and exerciseinduced PVCs and Torsades de Pointes (TdP).77 It was hypothesized that this mutant had altered interaction with AKAP150; in fact, when G406R-overexpressing mice were crossed with AKAP150 KO mice, they were protected against all phenotypes of the G406R mutant.
Investigators have also knocked out many of the potassium channel genes in mice to determine their effects on cardiac electrophysiology. When a dominantnegative fragment of KCNA1 was expressed, mice developed LQT and spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias.64 Interestingly, it was later shown by Glasscock et al173 that KCNA1 is preferentially expressed (≈10-fold higher) in atria over ventricles. Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) induced AF in KCNA1 knockout mice but did not lead to any ventricular arrhythmias and no differences in QT interval were observed. Dominant negative overexpression of KCNA5, KCNB1, or KCND2 all prolonged the QT interval without any other overt electrophysiological changes. Mice do not express KCNE3 in the adult heart, but deletion led to long QTc in aged female mice because of hyperaldosteronism.72
Mouse models of LQTS should be viewed with caution when the repolarizing current of interest does not reflect the human AP. As transgenic rabbit models become more common, they may find strong ground in advancing our understanding LQT pathogenesis. Rabbits accurately capture sex differences and express a similar repolarization ion channel gene profile as humans. An area of value will be evaluating predisposition to drug-induced LQT and arrhythmia,234 which rabbit models will be best suited to answer.

Short QT Syndrome Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is an extremely rare disorder; only a few 100 cases have been identified to date. SQTS is caused by the shortening of the cardiac AP. Like long QT syndrome, alterations in cardiac repolarization alter the QT interval. Because of the abbreviated QT interval, the refractory period is also shortened, leaving the heart susceptible to reentrant arrhythmias. Symptoms associated with short QT syndrome include both atrial and ventricular fibrillation, palpitations, and sudden cardiac death. Gain-of-function mutations in KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2 or loss-of-function mutations in CACNA1C, CACNB2, CACNA2D1, SCN5A, and SLC4A3 have all been associated with SQTS.
There are few genetic animal models available to examine SQTS in vivo. Zebrafish carrying the KCNH2L499P mutation have a shortened QT interval.83 Knockdown of SLC4A3 in zebrafish led to a short QT interval that was rescued by expressing WT SLC4A3 but not by SLC4A3-R370H, identified from a patient with SQTS.84 To appreciably capture the human cardiac AP, a rabbit model was engineered to overexpress KCNH2 carrying the N588K mutation.82 Transgenic rabbits had shortened AP and QTc but a normal T wave height. Ex vivo perfused hearts had inducible VT and VF; this model is arguably the best available and, as discussed above, rabbit models more accurately typify human cardiac repolarization.
Brugada Syndrome Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a disorder characterized by elevated ST segment, partial bundle branch block, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. It is commonly caused by mutations in SCN5A; however, ≈20 genes are now associated with BrS. Brugada ECG patterns are sometimes observed in overlap syndromes, such as with long QT syndrome, as SCN5A mutations are associated with several arrhythmia disorders. In mice, SCN5A deletion is embryonic lethal, but heterozygous mice survived and developed slowed conduction, pacing-induced VT, and fibrosis with age.88 Interestingly, the authors observed variability in phenotype penetrance that correlated with NaV1.5 expression levels.235 A mouse model for an overlap syndrome of LQT and Brugada was generated to carry 1795insD in SCN5A.60 Homozygous mice were embryonic lethal, but heterozygous mice developed sinus node dysfunction, slowed conduction, bradycardia, and QT prolongation. Interestingly, CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type Nav1.5 appears to phenocopy this mouse model, as late current predominates at slower heart rates. Phosphomimetic and phosphoablation mouse models demonstrated that phosphorylation and oxidation modulate Nav1.5 current and susceptibility to arrhythmias.137,236 A transgenic pig model was generated to better understand BrS disease mechanisms. Pigs were designed to carry the orthologous SCN5AE558X/+ mutation identified in a patient diagnosed with BrS and developed conduction abnormalities and QRS

widening but had no elevated ST segment, arrhythmias, or sudden death through 2 years of age.237 However, ex vivo hearts had increased susceptibility to VF with programmed stimulation. One debate surrounding BrS is whether many of the associated genes cause BrS or simply increase susceptibility to developing BrS. SCN5A mutations have variable and incomplete penetrance and differing phenotypes. Moreover, SCN5A mutations are prevalent in the general population and discerning pathogenesis can be difficult. Given the failure of animal BrS models to reproduce the full clinical syndrome, their utility studying BrS pathogenesis and treatment options remains to be determined.
Genetic Arrhythmia Syndromes Associated With Structural Heart Disease
Animal models have been beneficial for understanding the pathogenesis of arrhythmias caused by mutations in nonion channel genes that result in structural heart disease. The section below discusses the major arrhythmia syndromes associated with a cardiomyopathy phenotype (ARVC, HCM, and DCM) and microscopic structural disease such as AF, sick sinus syndrome, heart block, and preexcitation syndromes.
Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/ Dysplasia ARVC/dysplasia is a disease manifesting as fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium and widespread electrophysiological remodeling, predisposing individuals to ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of sudden death. Approximately half of the ARVC cases are caused by mutations in desmosomal proteins, which make up cell-cell mechanical junctions. Arrhythmias often arise during periods of exercise or stress, suggesting that catecholamines contribute to arrhythmogenesis. Accordingly, one of the primary phenotypes in animal models is catecholamineinduced ventricular arrhythmias.
The primary genetic model used to study ARVC has been the mouse. Of note, mice do not get fatty infiltration in the heart, one of the primary phenotypes of ARVC in humans. However, numerous cardiac phenotypes have been found, from remodeling to arrhythmogenesis. The first genetic mouse models to examine the importance of desmosomal proteins were congenital knockouts (Table 2). Mouse models with global knockout of plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2 are all embryonic lethal. However, heterozygotes survived and developed varying degrees of fibrosis and arrhythmia phenotypes (Table 2). Subsequent animal models were based on patient mutations and frequently resulted in haploinsufficiency. This seems to be the primary cause, along with repression of the Wnt signaling pathway. DSC2 (desmocollin-2) mutations are rare, and the link between

pathogenesis and this protein is not well understood because data are lacking and conflicting. DSC2 knockout mice are viable but did not develop any cardiac phenotypes. However, DSC2 knockdown reportedly led to altered ultrastructure and contractile dysfunction, while overexpression also led to fibrotic remodeling.105 Germline knockout of DSG2 (desmoglein-2) results in embryonic lethality in mice, but the cardiac-specific knockout led to dilation, fibrosis, and electrophysiological remodeling. Finally, the inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 has been linked to ARVC; knockout mouse model developed dilation, arrhythmia, and sudden death.110
The PKP2 (plakophilin-2) mouse model is well-suited for understanding ARVC mechanisms and disease progression. Heterozygote PKP2 mice survived and developed arrhythmias in the absence of overt structural remodeling,98 which was validated in mice carrying a PKP2 truncation mutant.99 These findings raised an interesting question about the cause of arrhythmias: how do arrhythmias arise in the absence of structural changes to the heart? Because PKP2 knockout is embryonic lethal, a cardiac-specific inducible PKP2 knockout mouse was generated, which had many of the characteristic ARVC phenotypes: fibrosis, remodeling, reduced ejection fraction, arrhythmia, and sudden death.100 In this model, PKP2 signaling regulates transcription of many genes involved in Ca2+ homeostasis and proteins of the intracellular Ca2+ release unit are downregulated, causing proarrhythmic RyR2 activity. The authors discovered that flecainide, a class Ic antiarrhythmic that inhibits RyR2 channels, effectively prevented arrhythmias in these mice. Exercise exacerbated RyR2 hyperactivity, and it was shown that membrane-permeable beta-blockers had greater efficacy than nonpermeable beta-blockers.238
ARVC has been observed in dogs and cats, generally of unknown cause. In these models, fibro-fatty replacement is commonly observed alongside syncope, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Dog models could be considered when disease mechanisms, as they relate to human cardiac (electro)physiology, are essential. Nondesmosomal proteins, such as phospholamban, RyR2, lamin A/C, transmembrane protein 43, and integrin linked kinase have all been associated with ARVC in patients; however, their role is less well understood due to the spectrum of phenotypes in ARVC. For example, some mutations in phospholamban cause DCM, which is a differential diagnosis, but may also present with ARVC. Because of the difficulty of identifying pathogenic mutations, diagnostic criteria rely on interpreting cardiac imaging and ECG data. An important line of investigation is understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the development of the disease, as early disease progression escapes detection and the heterogeneity of genes involved makes prognosticating a diagnosis difficult.
Dilated Cardiomyopathy Congenital DCM is characterized by ventricular dilation and is commonly caused by mutations in cytoskeletal

or myofibrillar proteins leading to remodeling, reduced ejection fraction, conduction abnormalities, arrhythmia, and sudden death. Many animal models have been created to investigate the structural and functional consequences of these mutations. Here we focus on animal models where arrhythmias are a prominent feature of the reported phenotype (Table 2). Of note, there is significant overlap with the clinical diagnosis of arrhythmogenic (right ventricular) cardiomyopathy.
A widely studied DCM mutant is SCN5A-D1275N. A wide spectrum of phenotypes in different families carrying this mutation have been reported, including AF, conduction defects, and sinus dysrhythmia.239,240 It is speculated that the variation in genetic background between the families contributes to these phenotypes. Homozygous SCN5A-D1275N mice developed many of the characteristic arrhythmia phenotypes observed in humans, while heterozygous mice did not.138 Many changes in the ECG parameters reflected a gene dose-dependent effect and these features were also observed in zebrafish.139
Mutations in LMNA cause severe DCM and sudden death. Several mouse models have been generated that carry mutations identified from patients (Table 2). A variety of symptoms have been reported and spontaneous arrhythmias occur frequently. Mutations in RMB20 also have a severe phenotype in mice, commonly leading to spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been studied in pig, dog, and mouse models, each having electrophysiological changes (Table 2).
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy HCM is characterized by enlargement of the left ventricle primarily caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins, leading to increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden death.241 HCM is commonly caused by mutations in either the beta myosin heavy chain or myosin binding protein C, together accounting for nearly half of all cases. Mice express beta myosin heavy chain during cardiogenesis, but rapidly switch from the beta to the alpha isoform, postnatal. Numerous HCM animal models have been generated; however, the predominant focus has been the study of underlying changes in sarcomere function, contractility, and hypertrophy, without detailed examination of electrophysiological phenotypes. Many studies have reported on arrhythmia susceptibility in ex vivo hearts but only reports examining in vivo arrhythmia phenotypes are discussed here.
Alpha myosin heavy chain mutations are commonly associated with HCM, but the only reports of arrhythmias in an animal model come from the R403Q mutant, which was identified in MYH7 from a human patient. The knock-in mouse model was designed to carry R403Q in MYH6.155 Mice developed HCM but only had a modest arrhythmia phenotype. A rabbit model was generated to overexpress the transgene but did not exhibit an arrhythmia phenotype.242 Troponin mutations are also associated

with HCM and a transgenic mouse was generated to carry TNNI3-G203S.153 Mice had conduction defects, but no other arrhythmias. However, when these mice were crossed with MYH6-R403Q mice, they developed a more severe phenotype with conduction defects, LQT, and catecholamine-induced VT.154 Knockout of MYBPC caused long QT and spontaneous VT in mice.158
Several troponin T models have been designed to carry mutations identified in patients. Knollmann et al149 showed that TNNT2-I79N mice had tachycardia, isoproterenol-inducible ectopy, and spontaneous nonsustained VT, despite having no hypertrophy or fibrosis. Subsequent work in mice demonstrated that Ca2+sensitizing TNNT2 mutations cause inducible arrhythmias, whereas nonsensitizing mutants (R278C) do not leave the heart susceptible to arrhythmias.151 Myofilament Ca2+ sensitization increases cytosolic Ca2+-binding affinity, alters intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and causes pause-dependent Ca2+-triggered arrhythmia.243 In addition, myofilament Ca2+ sensitization causes focal energy deprivation, which further increases arrhythmia susceptibility in mice.244 Hence, myofilament sensitization per se, caused by drugs, mutations, or posttranslational modifications after myocardial infarction,245 is a novel arrhythmia mechanism.246 These reports illustrate the power of murine HCM models for discovering new arrhythmia mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets.
Atrial Fibrillation AF is the most common arrhythmia and is characterized by rapid, abnormal atrial rhythms, with symptoms manifesting as palpitations, syncope, stroke, and heart failure, among others. The etiology of AF is multifactorial, stemming from environmental factors, diet, lifestyle, family history, medication, and surgery. For an in-depth review of acquired AF and various animal models available, the reader is referred to this review.247 Many genetic animal models develop AF alongside their primary disease phenotype (see Tables 1 and 2), but the models discussed in this section are more directly related to AF as a primary pathology.
One trigger for AF is thought to be hypersensitive and leaky RyR2 channels. Thus, animal models of CPVT (both gain-of-function RyR2 and loss-of-function Casq2) have been used to investigate arrhythmogenic mechanisms and screen therapeutic modalities.165 It was demonstrated that RyR2 inhibition can attenuate AF in these models. Other CPVT models are susceptible to AF with PES. A more severe phenotype was seen with CREM mice, which developed atrial dilation and spontaneous paroxysmal and persistent AF that worsened with age.167 A second trigger for AF may be channelopathies that accentuate excitability. KCNE1, SCN5A, KCNQ1, SK2, and SK3 mutations have all been introduced into

mice, with varying phenotypes (Table 2). The KCNE1 knockout mouse develops spontaneous AF.172 SCN5A models show overt structural changes, fibrosis, conduction abnormalities, and mitochondrial injury. Proteins associated with development, signaling pathways, and transcription regulation have been found to induce AF. Atrial-specific or complete knockout of LKB1 in mice caused electrical and structural remodeling and mice developed spontaneous AF.179,180 A goat model overexpressing constitutively active TGF-β1 had atrial fibrosis and AF inducibility with PES.181
Genome-wide association studies have identified many gene loci associated with increased AF risk.248 AF loci include genes known to affect ion channel function, cardiogenesis, or cell-cell conduction, although in many cases, candidate genes have not been determined. There are several animal models of inherited AF, mostly in mice. A primary challenge with mouse models of AF is that they do not commonly develop spontaneous AF, instead, only uncovering the phenotype with PES. Moreover, AF typically lasts for a brief period (on the order of seconds) before resolving. However, some mouse models have more severe and protracted AF that occurs spontaneously (Table 2). AF manifests in a wide range of cardiac diseases and resolving causative versus correlative pathogenesis is ongoing for some genetic models. Despite these shortcomings, investigators have successfully captured AF phenotypes in many different mouse models for genes identified in genomewide association studies studies or laboratory testing.
Genome-wide association studies have identified loss of function (PITX2, TBX5, GJA1) and gain of function (KCNN3) variants associated with patients with AF. PITX2 heterozygous mice had normal cardiac parameters except reduced transpulmonary flow; however, ex vivo hearts were more susceptible to atrial pacing-induced arrhythmia.176 Subsequent work showed AF in vivo with PES and several groups have used this model to study AF and explore treatment,249 especially since PITX2 is the most common risk locus identified in patients with AF. Inducible deletion of the TBX5 transcription factor led to a much more severe phenotype of spontaneous AF and electrophysiological remodeling within 2 weeks of tamoxifen treatment.177 Gene profiling identified numerous changes in the expression of Ca2+ handling proteins and ion channels, including PITX2. These data provide a link between TBX5-PITX2 activity and electrophysiological protein regulation in the heart. AF may also be promoted by delayed conduction. Mice carrying the GJA1-G60S/+ mutation are more susceptible to pacing-induced AF.178 Mice overexpressing KCNN3 had bradyarrhythmias, heart block, abnormal AV node morphology, and sudden death.212
Many other models have explored mutations or deletion of other ion channels, transcription factors,

Figure 3. Tissue-targeted CASQ2 knock-out mice help decipher the anatomic origin of ventricular ectopy in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Based on a combination of tissue-targeting and in silico modeling, the PMJ was identified as the likely origin of ventricular ectopy in CPVT. DAD indicates delayed afterdepolarization; LV, left ventricular; PMJ, Purkinje myocardial junction; and RV, right ventricular. Illustration credit: Ben Smith.

developmental pathways, or hormones to examine AF (Table 2). Data from patients have frequently confirmed the downregulation of various proteins, providing yet another link to pathogenesis. AF is a complex multifactorial disease; each animal model is an opportunity to extend our understanding of this disease.
Sick Sinus Syndrome Sick sinus syndrome occurs when the sinoatrial node is not capable of generating a normal rhythm. In heterozygous SCN5A± mice (see also Brugada Syndrome), investigators identified sick sinus syndrome phenotypes186 and sex differences in sinoatrial node function with age.250 The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) play an essential role in generating spontaneous pacemaker activity. Various models have examined the deletion of HCN1-4. HCN4 is the most abundant isoform, and congenital deletion in mice is embryonic lethal. However, embryonic hearts had sinus bradycardia.194 Inducible cardiac-specific knockout led to severe bradycardia, block, and sudden death within days.197 Mice with germline deletion of HCN1 or HCN2 survived and developed sinus dysrhythmia.192,193 Deletion of HCN3 did not lead to bradycardia or arrhythmia, but mice had subtle perturbations in their ECG morphology at lower heart rates.251 Perhaps the most elegant and accurate mouse model of sick sinus syndrome is an inducible HCN4-specific cellular ablation

mouse.198 This model accurately captured many of the phenotypes observed in patients, such as fibrosis of nodal tissue, sinoatrial dysrhythmia, supraventricular tachycardia, VT, and sudden death.
Atrioventricular Block AV block is partial or complete disruption of impulse propagation from the atria to the ventricles. As the single site for collating atrial depolarization and passing it to the ventricle, aberrant AV node function may prevent or delay sinus rhythm from conducting into the ventricle. The AV node makes up part of the conduction system and, as such, expresses many of the same ion channels and gap junctions as the sinoatrial node, bundle of His, and Purkinje cells. AV block is observed in many of the models described above. However, some genes seem to specifically alter AV node conduction and effect block without altering sinus node rhythm. The NKX2-5 gene appears to be definitely related to AV block in patients, and mouse models carrying 2 different mutations independently validated the role of this gene in disease progression.199,200
Preexcitation Syndrome Preexcitation occurs when the ventricles are activated prematurely via an accessory pathway. The most common mouse models generated to study preexcitation syndrome have mutations in PRKAG2, a regulatory subunit of 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase.204–206 Mutations

ANIMAL MODELS OF ACQUIRED ARRHYTHMIA DISORDERS
Acquired heart disease is the most common cause of increased arrhythmia risk in humans. Acquired heart disease develops over the course of a person’s life becasue of structural remodeling associated with hypertension,293 coronary artery disease,225 nonischemic cardiomyopathy,294 primary and secondary valvular disease,295 autoimmune rheumatic diseases,294 and myocarditis.296 Acute cardiac stress or injury leads to activation of specific cell signaling pathways,297,298 mitochondrial dysfunction,299,300 altered Ca2+ handling,301–303 and a switch in metabolism304 from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis.305 This leads to chronic changes in gene expression of trophic and mitotic factors, inflammation, and ultimately to myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. Pathological fibrosis is characterized by excessive proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts and ECM (extracellular matrix) protein deposition. Several key profibrotic factors have been identified, including TGF (transforming growth factor)-β, angiotensin II and aldosterone, which contribute to the development of cardiac fibrosis regardless of the underlying pathology.306 However, the relative contribution of a distinct molecular pathway depends on the type and the degree of the initial cardiac injury. Various animal models have been developed to study aspects of these acute and chronic changes leading to arrhythmia risk and are discussed below (Table 3).

Transverse Aortic Constriction
The transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model mimics chronic hypertension or aortic stenosis by causing a stricture in the thoracic aorta.252 Left ventricular and atrial pressure overload increases the wall tension leading to hypertrophy, chamber dilation, and fibrosis.307,308 This can be done in various methods, including sutures,252,253 inflatable cuffs309 or intravascular stents.258 Within hours of injury, myocyte hypertrophy is induced by activation of p38 MAP Kinase,310 ERK1/2,311 and PI3K/AKT signaling.312 Increased TGF-β production due to cytokine313 and adrenergic receptor activation314,315 leads to fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. The reninangiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in developing hypertrophy and arrhythmia, as treatment with ACE inhibitors316 and spironolactone317 reduces fibrosis and improving conduction velocity. This initially leads to ventricular hypertrophy, later followed by chamber dilation.313 While recruitment of Ly6ClowCXCR1+ macrophages has been found in the LV early after TAC,318 there is histologically less inflammation in this model than in other cardiac injury models.313 Notable in this model is the upregulation of NCX319 and downregulation of SERCA2a in myocytes over time, which is also seen in explant human hearts with reduced ejection fraction. While restoring SERCA2 has shown promise in improving systolic dysfunction320,321 and suppression of ventricular arrhythmias322,323 in animal models, the CUPID2 trial in patients with human hearts with reduced ejection fraction showed neutral results.324
In mice with TAC, multiple investigators have shown an increase conduction time, AP duration, and AV nodal

refractory period, QT prolongation with inducible atrial (50%–60%) and ventricular arrhythmias (40%–50%), but spontaneous arrhythmias in vivo are rare.325–328 Redistribution of connexin-43 (Cx43) laterally away from intercalating disk has been purposed to explain, in part, the changes in conduction in this model.327 Arrhythmia induction can be challenging in this model, which is likely due to variability in the extent of constriction postprocedure,254 the length of time of injury before analysis, sex, and strain.329–333 Care must be taken when comparing results from different injury protocols and strains in this model.
Similarly, rabbits, rats, and guinea swine develop ventricular hypertrophy and dilation after TAC, albeit over a more extended period (8 versus 4 weeks in mice)334 and with a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death. Unlike the mouse model, rabbits335–337 (aortic insufficiency with abdominal aortic constriction), rats,322,326 and guinea pigs338–340 develop spontaneous arrhythmias in response to catecholamine challenge. Similarly, these animals develop ventricular hypertrophy, chamber dilation and fibrosis after TAC, albeit over a more extended period (8 versus 4 weeks in mice)334 and with a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death. AP prolongation is a hallmark in these models and is linked to increased INaL and INCX with reduced ICaL responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulus and increased CaMKII activity, which is seen in human heart failure myocytes.341 Overall, these animals seem to represent a better model for arrhythmias than mice, albeit most studies use explanted heart in the Langendorff system.
Unlike small animals, no studies report an increase in arrhythmia in large animals with TAC. Ascending aortic constriction in pig and sheep has been described with polyester band259 or an implanted inflatable cuff.309,342 The swine model of TAC differs from other species as they tend to develop heart failure with preserved ejection fraction characterized by LV hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction.343–346 In contrast to pig, sheep develop cardiac dysfunction at 6 to 18 weeks post-TAC with elevated markers of ECM remodeling, chemokine production, and apoptosis,347 but no study reported arrhythmia generation outside procedural effects.
Myocardial Ischemia
Acute and chronic myocardial ischemia is a major cause of ventricular arrhythmias in humans. During acute ischemic, myocytes are exposed to hypoxia, acidosis, increased extracellular K+, and intracellular Ca2+0.348,349 Under ischemic conditions, cardiomyocyte mitochondria switch to glycolysis from fatty acid oxidation to maximize ATP production with limited oxygen supply.350 In addition, hypoxia leads to reactive oxygen species production that further damages intracellular proteins and organelles.351 Myocardial infarction occurs with myocyte apoptosis and replacement fibrosis if normal blood flow is not restored. This is a highly inflammatory model, with significant infiltration of

CD11b+ macrophages and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (CCL2, TNF-α, and IL-10) after injury, leading to proinflammatory Ly6chighCCR2+ macrophages early, then pro-wound healing Ly6clowCXCR1+ chronically, which contribute to interstitial fibrosis in the border zone.352 Chronically, myocardial fibrosis leads to conduction heterogeneity, a substrate for reentry arrhythmias.
In mice and rats, myocardial ischemia is induced surgically, either transiently by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury260,353 or complete occlusion by coronary artery ligation261,354 or cryoinjury.262,353,355 Unlike complete occlusion, I/R injury produces reversible ischemia that leads to significant myocardial dysfunction without widespread necrosis in the area at risk. Spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias are observed during the reperfusion phase.260 However, spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias are rare after complete occlusion aside from isolated preventricular contractions (internal data). In addition, LV dysfunction leads to volume overload in the left atrium, causing fibrosis and susceptibility to AF.356
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias can be induced universally in isolated explanted post-MI hearts, with the occurrence of VT (inducible in up to 90%–100% in mice), VF (inducible in up to 89% of rats), and AF (inducible in 73% of rats and 33% of mice).357–363 In vivo ventricular arrhythmia induction is more difficult, requiring rapid pacing protocols364–366 and a catecholamine challenge. Transvenous, pericardial, and transesophageal protocols have been described for AF and ventricular arrhythmia induction, with the occurrence of VT (20%–70% in mice and rats)367 and AF (60%–90% in mice).368 Electrophysiological study of isolated myocytes from acute and chronic infarcted hearts has shown both shortening of the myocardial effective refractory period and slowing of condition time in the left atria, infarct, and border zone.357 The proposed mechanism for AF induction is reduced expression of Cx40, dephosphorylation of Cx40 and Cx43, and redistribution from the intercalated disc to the lateral cell membrane.362
Established models for rabbit myocardial ischemia focus extensively on ex vivo studies using Langendorf perfusion systems. After infarction, rabbit myocardium shows prolonged APD and Ca2+ transients ex vivo.369 Unlike mice and rats, infarction in rabbits leads to delayed AV nodal conduction becaue of fibrosis and reduction in Cx40 expression but did not affect the ventricular effective refractory period.370 No arrhythmia induction protocol was used in these studies.
Dog models focus on atrial ischemia and arrhythmias, with ~40% of animals developing AF.371 Increased INCX current, spontaneous Ca2+ leak, and conduction heterogeneity were found in myocytes from the border zone of the atrial infarct, supporting both triggered and reentry as the mechanism in this model.372 The use of beta-blocker (nadolol) and Ca2+ channel inhibitor (nifedipine) were more effective at suppressing atrial arrhythmia in this model than class Ic (flecainide) or class III (dofetilide) antiarrhythmic drugs.373

Pig myocardial ischemia models are well established as they are of similar size and physiology as humans. Ischemia can be induced by either transient intravascular occlusion of the coronary artery or chronic occlusion with an ameroid constructor.374 Acutely, pig are exquisitely sensitive to ischemia because of lack of functional collaterals at baseline, which leads to significant procedural mortality from VF.375 After chronic ischemia, SCD due to spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias occurs in ≈60% to 70% of animals by 3 months.376,377 Myocytes in the remote zone from have a decreased rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), altered Na+-Ca2+ exchange current (INCX), and increases of late Na+ current (INaL), Ca2+-activated K+ current [IK(Ca)], and Ca2+activated Cl− current [ICl(Ca)]. In addition, myocytes in the border zone show the same changes along with a decrease of L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL), a decrease of inward rectifier K+ current (IK1), and arrhythmogenic SR Ca2+ release-induced EADs and DADs.378 These changes in the current lead to shortening of the APD in the border zone and prolonged APD in the remote region, setting up a substrate for both triggered and reentrant arrhythmias. Gene therapy with dominant-negative K+ channel (KCNH2-G628S)379 or Cx43380 reduced VT induction by prolonging the ADP and effective refractory period in the border zone.
Complete Heart Block and AV Node Ablation
Complete heart block leads to AV dyssynchrony and bradycardia, which acutely causes reduced cardiac output and induces volume overload. Compensatory hemodynamic changes occur to improve cardiac function, including ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, and increased stroke volume but are not able to fully restore cardiac output.381 While genetic models are available for primary complete heart block, secondary complete heart block, which is characterized by fibrosis and necrosis of the AV node, is more difficult to reproduce. Outside histological remodeling, little is known about the molecular changes associated with secondary complete heart block.
Given the size, mouse AV node is challenging to identify without immunostaining.382 Genetic have generated to establish the important transcription factors and ion channels in the AV node (noted in the above section atrioventricular block). Interestingly, disruption of tissue resident macrophages in the AV node, by either knockout of Cx43 in these cells or by genetic ablation of macrophages using diphtheria toxin receptor/diphtheria treatment, lead to progressive AV conduction block.383 While these resident macrophages were noted in human AV nodes, it unclear if the presence or absence in of these cells contribute to human disease.
Electrical needle AV nodal ablation in rats has been described, as it was noted that alcohol injection leads to either transient block or mortality based on the amount used.268,384 This is a technically challenging model with variable success384 and high early mortality because of bradycardia and

ventricular arrhythmias, as only 6-month-old female rats survived past 3 days.268 Regardless, the surviving rats recapitulated the cardiac remodeling in humans, with 80% showing spontaneous TdP at baseline which could be induced to sustained VT with PES and isoproterenol challenge.268
The dog model of AV ablation by transvenous catheter injection for formaldehyde has been well established and leads to compensated hypertrophy and QT prolongation.270,271 This is due to APD prolongation in the setting of bradycardia, with ≈50% of animals developing spontaneous and 90% drug-induced TdP.385 Chronically, this reduced IKs current and enhanced Ca2+ influx by NCX, leading to increased SR Ca2+ content,386 which increases the risk for DADs.387 In contrast, goats undergoing AV ablation did not show APD prolongation but led to increased PLB (phospholamban), Troponin-I and myosin light chain kinase by PKA and RyR2 by CaMKII, suggesting increased Ca2+ sensitivity in this model.272

Chronic Tachypacing

Overriding the normal conduction system has many del-

eterious effects but is often reversible. Rapid atrial heart

rate or pacing can lead to tachycardia-mediated heart

failure, and long-term RV pacing in humans can lead to

ventricular dyssynchrony, reduced cardiac output, and

heart failure.381 Long-term pacing has been shown to be

detrimental to LV, with significant wall motion abnormali-

ties and perfusion defects in the inferior and apical walls

without corresponding coronary disease.388 Conversely,

cardiac resynchronization therapy improves HF out-

comes for patients with HF and left-bundle branch block.

RV pacing has been used as a model of nonischemic

cardiomyopathy, developing significant systolic dysfunction.

Long-term RV pacing in AV nodal ablated dogs show the

same perfusion mismatches seen in humans and was asso-

ciated with increased sympathetic innervation of the ventri-

cles.389 Overdrive RV pacing for 4 weeks in dogs can induce

spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and SCD in 25% of

dogs.390 Myocytes isolated from paced ventricles showed

prolonged ADP with reduced Ito currents,391 likely due in part

heart. In addition, Ca2+ transients showed reduced ampli-

tude, slowed relaxation, and blunted frequency dependence

due to reduction in SERCA2a and upregulation of NCX in

failing myocytes.394 Cardiac resynchronization therapy in

this model was showed to normalization of APD, reduce

the INa,L current, and prevent the negative remodeling associated with heart failure in this model.393,395,396 VF can be

induced in pig by applying AC current to the RV, but using

arrhythmic drugs to improve resuscitation was not seen.397

Ventricular pacing in dogs also leads to secondary

atrial fibrosis, dilation, and reduced function as the LV

fails, inducing AF.398,399 As with rapid ventricular pacing,

rapid atrial pacing leads to a reduction in the Ito, in addition to ICa,L and IKs currents.400 If pacing is stopped and

the animal is allowed to recover, the ion currents return to normal, but fibrosis remains, leading to persistent AF. Studying atrial cells from dogs undergoing both rapid atrial and ventricular pacing has shown the atrial ion channel expression in HF, AT, and HF with AT can be significantly different.401 Upregulation of profibrotic miRNA has also been described in atrial paced dogs, providing a novel target to prevent atrial fibrosis and AF.402,403
In rabbits, rapid atrial pacing increases atrial fibrosis and TGF-β signaling, which can be attenuated with losartan.274 AF can be induced in 40% of rabbits in this model. Atrial pacing leads to decrease KCNE1 KCNB2 expression, reduced IKs, and shortening the AERP.404 This was thought to be due to microRNA-1 upregulation in the atria.
In sheep, natriuretic peptide release is found immediately after RV pacing, returning to normal after cessation.281 In goats, chronic atrial pacing led to atrial dilation, with reduced PKA phosphorylation of PLB and increased CaMKII phosphorylation of RyR2, leading to reduced SR Ca2+ load.272 While structural changes similar to humans with tachycardia mediated cardiomyopathy are seen, increased arrhythmogenesis has not been reported.
Given their small size, in vivo pacing is difficult in mice. Tethered epicardial pacing has been used to study AV dyssynchrony and synchrony in mice after I/R injury. Dyssynchrony leads to further deterioration of cardiac function and activation of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, and MSK1 and inhibition of the GSK3β pathways. This was reversed by resynchrony.277 Recently, the development of fully implantable epicardial micro pacing technology may allow for longitudinal pacing studies.405
In rats, initiation of rapid atrial pacing leads to upregulation of multiple voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3),273 which contribute to repolarization by IKr and ITo. After 2 days of atrial pacing, AF can be induced in ≈20% of animals, with upregulation of associated AF genes (CASQ2, KCNJ2, and TGFB) and activation of the TGF-β and IL-6 pathways.406 Rapid transesophageal pacing of the LV has been used to reliably induce VF to study the effects of medication for resuscitation.407
Inflammation
Myocardial inflammation is a known driver of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.408,409 Postprocedural arrhythmias are common after cardiothoracic surgery but, while they are usually self-limiting, they lead to prolonged hospital stays.410 While there is usually a preexisting arrhythmogenic substrate due to the underlying disease, surgical scarring and inflammation further exacerbate the system, leading to arrhythmia. Large cohort studies have shown elevated proinflammatory cytokines associated with persistent AF, including CRP,411–413 TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10.414,415 After surgery, there is an increase in both macrophages and neutrophils to the surgical site, with reactive oxygen species production from MPO (myeloperoxidase) activity.416,417

Inflammation because of myocarditis is more complex, and the course of the acute and chronic phase of the immune response is dependent on the underlying cause (infectious versus rheumatological). The cytokine profiles are found in viral and autoimmune myocarditis includes more proinflammatory monocyte infiltration and myocyte necrosis than postsurgical injury.418 This leads to a multitude of ECG changes, including sinus tachycardia, widened QRS patterns, low voltage, prolonged QT, variable AV blocks, and diffuse ST-elevations.419–421
Sterile inflammation has been used to induce AF in dogs287 and sheep.288 Pericardial talc treatment of dog atria to induce sterile inflammation induced AF in ≈60% of dogs and was significantly reduced with topical steroids or NSAIDS.287 In sheep, treatment with atorvastatin reduced hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α expression, which improved the atrial effective refractory period at 72 hours.288 While inflammatory myocarditis can be induced in rats285 and guinea pigs,422 no current reports on the arrhythmia potential are available.
Currently, there are 2 models of viral myocarditis due to exposure to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)423 and encephalomyocarditis virus A (EMCV).424 There are several issues with the viral myocarditis models in animals. First, of the viruses primarily associated with human myocarditis (parvovirus B19, herpes simplex 9 and coxsackievirus B3), only CVB3 is infectious to animals, with EMCV only rarely causing human disease newborns. Second, the CVB3 mouse model is highly inflammatory and more mimics childhood infections than the milder course in adults.425 Third, only particular stains of mice are susceptible to viral infection. Regardless, C3H/He mice exposed to develop similar arrhythmias to humans (80% sinus arrest, 30% second or third-degree AV block, 30% PACs, 20% PVCs, and 10% VT).426 Ex vivo electrophysiological studies showed no change to the APD, but mice exposed to CVB3 were hyperpolarized with slightly increased VERP.427 EMCV exposed DBA/2 mice develop AV block in 40% of mice over 2 weeks, with two-thirds of those mice showing mononuclear cell infiltration and edema and another onethird showing necrosis of the conduction system.428 No further electrophysiological studies were conducted.
Traditionally, myocarditis can be induced in mice by either immunizing with a cardiac structural peptide (myosin heavy chain [MHC-α] or cardiac troponin I)283 or delivering primed dendritic cells pulsed with MHCα.284 Importantly, BALB/c mice are susceptible to peptide immunized myocarditis while C57BL/6 strains are resistant, from which a majority of transgenic lines are created.429 MHC-α peptide-induced myocarditis showed significant immune cell infiltration, increased expression of both TNFα and INFγ, fibrosis and prolongation for the APD in ventricular myocytes, which all could be attenuated with atorvastatin.285,422,430

myocarditis.431 These mice succumb to progressive ventricular hypertrophy and SCD early. Progressive AV block and sinus arrest occurs in ~30% of transgenic mice, similar to arrhythmia seen in patient with immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced myocarditis. Further study using this model would greatly improve treatment for patient with adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Metabolic- and Drug-Induced Arrhythmia
Dietary and metabolic considerations also contribute to atrial arrhythmia development as there is a known association with BMI and diabetes in AF,432,433 and incidence of paroxysmal AF is reduced after gastric bypass surgery.434 Off-target drug effects lead to adverse clinical outcomes, particularly arrhythmias induction due to block of delayed rectifier K+ channels, IKr, causing drug-induced long QT syndrome and TdP ventricular arrhythmias.
Streptozotocin-induced diabetic models have been developed for both mice and rats435 and consistently shown prolonged APD, increased sympathetic innervations, and inflammation. Studies have shown this is likely due to production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in diabetes animals, but they are inconstant in the electrophysiological mechanisms.436 Initial studies showed a reduction in the Ito current as the underlying cause of AF,437–439 while others suggest changes in sinoatrial node connexin channel expression,440,441 atrial myocyte Ca2+ handling proteins (TRPC1/6, RyR3)442 and AV nodal ion channels (TRPC1, CASQ2, RYR2, and RYR3)443 are involved. Diabetic mice and rats also have reduced K+ channel expression, leading to overall reduced K+ currents, which was dependent on glycosylation of CaMKII and activation PKC.444 Further studies showed in the setting of hyperglycemia, mice had more diastolic calcium leak through RyR2, prolonged ADP90, ADP alternans, increased DADs, and frequent premature ventricular complex, which could be suppressed by genetic inhibition of CaMKII.445 Blocking IL-1β activation of CaMKII in this model restores the APD to normal and suppresses VT induction in explanted hearts from diabetic mice.446 These studies all provide a central role for CaMKII in regulating ion channel expression and function in hyperglycemia.
Diet-induced obesity has been shown to affect inflammation and gene expression in multiple disease models. Mice fed 3 months of a high-fat diet had a 15% increase in their QTc and increased IKs current than mice on a normal diet and developed a 10-fold increase in premature ventricular complex burden.447 The increased IKs current was thought to be due to the reduced expression of voltagegated K+ channels. Diet-induced obesity mice were also found to have reduced NaV1.5 expression and current, leading to reduced ADP and conduction velocity in the atrial and increased incidence of induced AF.448 Diet-induced obesity rats over 8 weeks have increased expression of CaV1.2, HCN4, Kir2.1, RYR2, NCX, and SERCA2a in the LV, which

may contribute to DADs and triggered PVCs.449 Rabbits fed a high-fat diet had increased cardiac sympathetic innervation (as seen by increased GAP23 expression), prolonged ADP and increased ICa, which led to QTc prolongation and repolarization heterogeneity in the ventricle.450 Isolated hearts were more susceptible to VT induction. While these studies highlight the important changes to ion channel expression animals due to a high-fat Western diet, further study is needed to linking these findings to humans.
A specific line of inbred rats (Fischer F344 at 20–24 months) develop age-dependent adverse cardiac remodeling, with males developing more cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, intestinal fibrosis, and systolic dysfunction and females with more cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction.451 Aged female Fischer F344 rats show enlarged atrial, fibrosis, and CD68+ monocyte infiltration, similar to human disease.452 Both male and female Fischer 344 rats are more susceptible to AF induction by atrial pacing, with 80% of animals showing atrial arrhythmia.452,453 These are the only models of spontaneous AF in aged animals and could provide important insight to mechanism and future therapies for AF in our aging population.
In rabbits treated with clofilium (K+ channel blocker), 70% of animals develop TdP, which can be increased to 100% with the addition of α1 agonist methoxamine.454 Blockade of CaMK (calmodulin kinase) or PKA in this model reduced pause-dependent VT that was independent of these kinases effect on L-type Ca2+ channel activity.455 Interestingly, the dose-dependent CaMKII blockade did not change the QT interval, unlike the dosedependent PKA blockade. Further study showed that blocking CaMKII reduced the ratio of the TU interval, which is likely more critical than the QT interval in the induction of pause-dependent VT.456
EMERGING ETIOLOGIES OF ARRHYTHMOGENESIS: OPPORTUNITY FOR ANIMAL MODELS
Cardiac electrophysiology is regulated not only by the amino acid sequence at the protein level but also by posttranslational modifications, micropeptides, epigenetics, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), micro RNAs (miRs), aging, and environmental factors. Unprecedented advances in sequencing technology, deep mutational scanning, and epigenetic and transcriptome mapping have highlighted several new areas of pathogenesis. A primary challenge with many of the ascribed changes is whether they directly cause disease or, rather, follow disease progression. Animal models have been generated to address this challenge and study new areas of arrhythmia biology, with a select few highlighted below.
In the past decade, micropeptides have been identified that were previously excluded during annotations of open reading frames due to their small size or position in the transcriptome. In the heart, functionally expressed

peptides include examples such as sarcolipin and dwarf open reading frame, which regulate SR Ca reuptake. Sarcolipin protein levels are decreased in humans with AF or heart failure457 and the sarcolipin knockout mouse developed AF with age.169 In mice with DCM, overexpression of dwarf open reading frame attenuated the heart failure phenotype, although arrhythmias were not examined.458 The micropeptides apelin and elabela affect cardiogenesis, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and inotropic responses. Reduced apelin levels predicted major myocardial events and MI scar size in patients with a previous MI event.458 Apelin knockout mice developed larger scars and increased mortality following MI, although arrhythmias were not described.459 These findings establish the pathogenic role and therapeutic potential for micropeptides in the heart, but their impact on arrhythmogenesis remains to be examined.
Posttranslational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, are documented in many arrhythmias.460 While phosphorylation by PKC, PKA, and CaMKII are the most studied mediators for changes in Na+ channels,137,236,461,462 Ca2+ channels,463–465 K+ channels,466 NCX,467 and RyR2,468 conflicting data exist regarding the relative contribution of different phosphorylation sites to ion currents. Phosphomimetic and phosphoablation mouse models have been created to tease out the importance of each site to arrhythmogenesis.137,463,469,470 In addition, posttranslational modification of signaling kinases themselves, including PKA471 and CaMKII,471 play a role in arrhythmia susceptibility in response to oxidative stress. Other posttranslational modifications are less well studied, and it remains to be determined whether these cause disease or are merely epiphenomena.
Epigenetic DNA modifications regulate protein expression. It is now recognized that many cardiovascular diseases are associated with epigenetic changes. For example, cardiac-specific deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in mice led to dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and premature death.472 A family with a history of autosomal recessive DCM was later discovered to carry homozygous mutation in GATAD1.473 In AF, epigenetics also contribute to risk as it relates to hypertension, obesity, age, and other factors.474 Patients with persistent AF have genome-wide changes in DNA methylation,475 and animal models could help elucidate the pathophysiology of these changes at the whole genome or protein level.
MiRs regulate gene expression by RNA complementation and silencing. In the heart, miRs control cardiogenesis and pathways to affect gene expression during development. Some miRs are muscle specific and may serve as macroregulators of ion channel expression. In disease, changes in many different miRs have been documented. In dogs with rapid pacing, nicotine administration reduced miR-133 and miR-590 levels and increased AF risk.476 Atrial tachypacing in dogs and development of AF was also associated with changes in many miRs compared with control.477 Dogs with ventricular tachypacing developed CHF and AF and miR-29b levels declined within the first

24 hours of pacing.478 In zebrafish, miR-182 served as a TBX-5 effector and miR-182 upregulation led to block, tachycardia, and arrhythmias.479 In mice, it was shown that miR-1 directly binds to the C-terminus of Kir2.1 and represses channel activity.480 Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in miR-1 identified from patients with AF did not suppress Kir2.1 channel activity and failed to rescue arrhythmia inducibility in miR-1 knockdown mice (whereas WT miR-1 did). Of most interest is the therapeutic potential for RNA regulation to reverse disease progression.
LncRNA regulates gene expression via several mechanisms and changes in lncRNA expression have been documented in a wide range of diseases. Altered expression of lncRNA has been observed in AF,481 including altered regulation of PITX2.482 Another study in rabbits with AF induced by atrial tachypacing purported a mechanism whereby lncRNA “sponges” up miR-328 to regulate CACNA1C.483 Yet another report indicated changes in lncRNA in AF reduce expression of JP2 and RYR2.484 These studies demonstrate additional mechanisms of regulation beyond controlling gene expression and open up the field to exciting new opportunities in arrhythmia research.
CONCLUSIONS
For decades, animal models have been an essential tool to study arrhythmia pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches. Recent work with genetic mouse models yielded a new diagnostic tool in CRDS, identified lifesaving drug therapies for CPVT, LQT3, and ARVC, identified pathogenic mechanisms, and advanced our understanding of arrhythmogenesis in ways that other models cannot. The broad availability of transgenic mouse models and the option to generate mice with cell-specific and/or time-dependent regulation of gene expression provides a significant advantage of the mouse over other small animal species. A major limitation is that their fast heart rate, small heart size, and differential ionic currents do not fully recapitulate human cardiac electrophysiology. While guinea pigs and rabbits can overcome some of these electrophysiological limitations, genetic manipulation is limited in these species. Large animal electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters match humans more closely but can be prohibitively expensive. Regardless, large animals are useful for preclinical studies evaluating new drugs, gene therapy, and devices that necessitate large animal models before moving to humans. Here, we provide an in-depth review of existing animal models to help interpreting published arrhythmia mechanisms as well as planning future experimental studies investigating cardiac arrhythmia diseases.
