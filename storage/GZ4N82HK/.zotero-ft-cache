Introduction

Background
• Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world [Friedrich, 2017] • CAD remains leading cause of death [McAloon et al., 2016] • Up to 20% of patients with CAD have depression, and cardiovascular
mortality is 3 times higher in patients with comorbid CAD and depression. [Meijer et al., 2011, Lichtman et al., 2014, Jha et al., 2019] • No contemporary interventions, such as antidepressant medications, improve future adverse CAD-related outcomes [Kronish et al., 2019]
2

The autonomic nervous system connects the brain and the heart. This presents a “neurocardiac perspective” on a common mechanistic pathway in both depression and CAD. [Taggart et al., 2011, Carney and Freedland, 2017] 1

Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
Heart rate variability can represent the current state of the ANS as a potential “biomarker” of neurocardiac health. Heart Rate Fluctuations
• Fluctuations in the HR are mediated by sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) inputs to the sinoatrial node
• Rapid fluctuations in HR reflect vagal/PNS control • Slower fluctuations in HR reflect SNS and PNS integartion, along with other
influences
HRV
• External influences such as activity, mental stress, etc • Internal period rhythms also exist: RSA, baroreceptor reflexes, circadian
rhythm, RAAS/neuroendocrine secretions, etc
4

We are studying the novel non-linear HRV metric, Dyx, in both CAD and depression. Dyx is generated from the Poincare plot using the multipole method, which characterizes the scatter of variability of subsequent heart beats.2

We have shown using the non-linear HRV metric, Dyx, is a powerful predictor of CAD,3 and can also be a useful marker for depression.

Study Aims
• Dyx has not been prospectively evaluated as a biomarker of CAD (by angiography) and depression
• Pilot study (below) examines this relationship in a prospective clinical cohort
Figure 4: Overview of relationship to ANS dysfunction

Hypothesis
In participants at high risk for CAD: 1. We hypothesize that elevated PHQ-9 scores will associate with abnormal HRV 2. We hypothesize that abnormal HRV will associate with obstructive CAD (stenosis > 70%).

Methods

Study overview
• Emory Biobank [Ko et al., 2017] • Prospective clinical cohort undergoing cardiac catherization • Indications: pre-op, heart transplant, UA, NSTEMI, STEMI, positive stress test • Angiographic severity indices measured by CASS / Gensini scores [Gensini,
1983]
• Psychological questionnaires: depression by PHQ9 (≥ 10 considered
moderate-to-severe depression)
9

ECG and HRV collection
• ECG data is collected using the VivaLNK patch (6-24 hours of data per patient), starting AM of angioggraphy
• HRV was generated through signal processing in Matlab (PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox)
• HRV was blocked into averaged 1-hour segments for analysis • Dyx was also generated, which summarizes a Poincare plot by the ratio of
the kurtoses of the y-axis and x-axis
Figure 5: VivaLNK ECG Patch

Statistical analysis
• For this pilot study, the first hour of HRV was used (to control for procedural sedation, the effects of catherization, etc)
• Linear/logistic regression models were used to predict depression by HRV • Linear/logistic regression models were used to predict CAD plaque burden

Effect of HRV on CAD

Discussion

Interpretion of Findings
• Depression is associated with ANS dysfunction, particularly decreases in HF HRV
• CAD is not associated with HRV • Other manifestations of CAD (e.g. ischemica and no obstructive CAD) are worth exploring • More low risk controls (no heart failure, normal stress tests) needed
• HRV reflects depression, but do not have evidence that it predicts CAD in this very high risk group (based on limited sample) • Need to evaluate interaction between CAD and depression
