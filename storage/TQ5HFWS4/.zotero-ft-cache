Acute-on-chronic liver failure combines an acute deterioration in liver function in an individual with pre-existing chronic liver disease and hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, and is associated with substantial short-term mortality. Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40% of patients, no precipitating event is identiﬁed. Systemic inﬂammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classiﬁcation and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identiﬁcation and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly eﬀective intervention in some speciﬁc cases, but recipient identiﬁcation, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with deﬁned diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.

Introduction
Cirrhosis, irrespective of cause, is often asymptomatic until an episode of acute decompensation. Development of liver-speciﬁc complications from portal hypertension or hepatic insuﬃciency, including ascites, variceal bleeding, infection, and hepatic encephalopathy, occur in as many as 15% of patients with cirrhosis each year— frequency and severity increase as hepatic functional reserve and structural distortion progressively worsen.1–4 When acute decompensation occurs, many patients respond to standard interventions and return to a compensated state. However, as many as a third develop further hepatic or extrahepatic organ failure, or both, and in a proportion of patients disease progresses to multiorgan failure, with need for critical care support.
Hepatic and extrahepatic organ failure can occur in the context of a gradual progression of cirrhosis during months, which is commonly referred to as decompensated cirrhosis. It can also come on suddenly— ie, short-term deterioration over days to several weeks after deﬁned or undeﬁned precipitating illness—socalled acute-on-chronic liver failure.5 Despite aggressive support and use of substantial resources, short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure is high (often exceeding 50%).4,6 Many of the 170 000 deaths
Search strategy and selection criteria
We searched PubMed and MEDLINE with the term “acute on chronic liver failure” to identify studies and publications in addition to those familiar to the authors or cited by guidelines. We used no date or language restrictions, and our ﬁnal search was on Feb 23, 2015. We reviewed the references of reports identiﬁed by our search to identify further studies that might be relevant to this Seminar. References were selected on the basis of their ability to provide insight into acute-on-chronic liver failure and its clinical management and guide the reader to relevant sources for further reading.

from cirrhosis in Europe each year occur in intensive care units (ICUs), and UK estimates of ICU costs per survivor exceed £50 000.7 In the USA, the yearly cost of ICU care for patients with cirrhosis is estimated at US$3 billion.8 In view of the high mortality and cost of care in patients with cirrhosis, reluctance to admit them to critical care settings seems common.9,10 However, improvements in care have led to progressive improvements in outcomes of patients admitted to hospital with acute decompensation and acute-onchronic liver failure, and universal prognostic pessimism is not justiﬁed7,11–14 (ﬁgures 1, 2). In this clinical Seminar, we discuss the deﬁnitions, diagnostic, and prognostic criteria of acute-on-chronic liver failure, advances in the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, and approaches to clinical management.
Deﬁnition
Although clinicians have recognised acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure as separate clinical entities for many years, no universally accepted diagnostic criteria were available.15,16 Distinct clinical and pathophysiological diﬀerences have emerged in studies, and two deﬁnitions have been proposed, by the Asia-Paciﬁc Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European and American associations for the study of liver disease (panel).17,18 The diﬀerences were resolved as part of a consensus meeting organised under the auspices of the World Congress of Gastroenterology, at which the decision was made that, to be a distinct clinical entity, acute-on-chronic liver failure should be distinct from both acute liver failure and decompensated cirrhosis, with clear clinical, laboratory, and pathophysiological features, and should have a validated clinical scoring system for assessment of severity.5 Investigators in two large, prospective, observational studies of patients—one in Europe (Chronic Liver Failure [CLIF] Consortium Acute on Chronic [CANONIC])4 and one in Canada and the USA (North American Consortium

for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease [NACSELD])19— have attempted to deﬁne groups of patients with cirrhosis at high risk of short-term mortality, which form the basis of a working deﬁnition.
The deﬁnition includes patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis and is inclusive of the fact that disease can occur in patients with chronic but noncirrhotic liver disease, making possible, for example, inclusion of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection in whom acute-on-chronic liver failure can be triggered by reactivation of viral replication or de-novo and superimposed infection with other hepatotrophic viruses (typically hepatitis A or E viruses). Non-cirrhotic acute-on-chronic liver failure has been called type A disease, and can be distinguished from acute liver failure only by histopathological evidence of substantial hepatic ﬁbrosis. Type B disease is proposed to occur in patients with compensated cirrhosis with hepatic deterioration after a major insult such as infection, surgery, or acute alcoholic hepatitis. Type C disease occurs with similar precipitants but in patients with a previous or contemporaneous episode of cirrhotic decompensation (ﬁgure 3). This proposed classiﬁcation recognises that acute-on-chronic liver failure is probably a syndrome with several causes rather than a single disease, and is deﬁned by the development of both hepatic and extrahepatic organ failure.
Severity
The CANONIC study was designed to develop diagnostic criteria for acute-on-chronic liver failure that would identify patients with a 28 day mortality of more than 15%. In this multicentre study,4 1343 patients with cirrhosis were assessed, who were admitted to hospital with acute decompensation complicated by rapid onset of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, or bacterial infection. A predeﬁned modiﬁcation of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score,20 which is used in other critical illness, provided the CLIF-SOFA score (later simpliﬁed to the CLIF Consortium [CLIF-C] organ failure score; appendix), which can be used to deﬁne the presence of speciﬁc organ systems failure (table). Patients with organ failure were classiﬁed as having acute-on-chronic liver failure, with three grades of severity. Patients with acute decompensation had 28 day mortality of less than 5%. Mortality associated with acute-on-chronic liver failure increased with increasing organ failure: patients in whom one organ had failed had 28 day mortality of about 20%, which increased to greater than 70% in those in whom three organs had failed (ﬁgure 4).
The most common cause of acute-on-chronic liver failure was alcoholic liver disease, the main identiﬁed precipitating illness was infection, and the extrahepatic organs that failed most often were the kidneys. Prognostic importance of single organ failure varied by the speciﬁc system involved. Subsequent external validation studies

Diﬀerent deﬁnitions of organ failures were used in the NACSELD study,19 in which 507 patients with cirrhosis who were admitted to hospital with infection were assessed; ﬁndings were similar to those of CANONIC. Patients with severe liver disease were more likely to develop acute-on-chronic liver failure than were those with less severe disease, and survival worsened as the number of failing extrahepatic organ systems rose.

Clinical course and outcome prediction
About 10% of patients admitted with acute decompensation will develop acute-on-chronic liver failure while in hospital.4,21,28 In the CANONIC study,28 roughly 50% of patients who presented with acute-onchronic liver failure improved; around 20% deteriorated, and in these patients mortality was greater than 50%. Improvement was most common (55%) in those who had only one failing extrahepatic organ, and became less likely with increasing organ failure. The course of illness

during patients’ ﬁrst days in hospital were signiﬁcantly linked to eventual outcome, suggesting that recognition and aggressive early management could be key to improvement of survival.
In a prognostic model designed to predict survival, CLIF-C organ failure score, age, and white cell count were independent predictors of mortality.21 These factors were incorporated into a new score, the CLIF-C Acuteon-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) score, which was compared with the clinical scoring systems used to assess severity of chronic liver disease: the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and the Child-Pugh score.29,30 The CLIF-C ACLF score measures both hepatic and extrahepatic organ dysfunction and it discriminates signiﬁcantly better between survivors and non-survivors than did MELD and the Child-Pugh systems, which underestimated the risk of death in acute-on-chronic liver failure. MELD and the Child-Pugh score form the basis of organ allocation in liver transplantation systems, and thus patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure who are being considered for liver transplantation might be at a disadvantage. In intensive care units, such scores might be used in decision making for admission, but their predictive value is inadequate for them to form the sole criterion to assess futility of continued care.14 Serial application seems better at predication of outcome than a single observation on admission.14
Clinical characteristics and pathophysiology
Predisposition Acute-on-chronic liver failure is complex and its clinical features and pathophysiology can be thought of in terms of the predisposition, injury, response, and organ (PIRO) framework that was developed for the classiﬁcation of patients with severe sepsis.31,32
In the CANONIC study, cirrhotic patients presenting with acute decompensation who developed acute-onchronic liver failure (type C) were signiﬁcantly younger and more likely to have alcoholic cirrhosis than were those who did not develop acute-on-chronic liver failure, and acute-on-chronic liver failure was signiﬁcantly less likely to progress in those with hepatitis C virus infection.4 In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, risk of acute-on-chronic liver failure and subsequent mortality was similar in those with a clinical diagnosis of acute alcoholic hepatitis and those with acute decompensation due to another cause, suggesting that once acute-onchronic liver failure develops, its severity determines outcome more strongly than does the underlying cause.4
Injury (precipitating event) A precipitating event is not necessary for a diagnosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure. In more than 40% of patients who develop the disorder, no precipitating event is noted.4,33 The mechanism of acute deterioration in this population is unknown and necessitates further study. These patients have clinical signs of a similar

inﬂammatory response to those with an identiﬁed precipitating event. Perhaps laboratory investigations do not identify infective precipitants or covert acute alcoholic hepatitis, or possibly a spontaneous self-resolving infection or episode of intestinal bacterial translocation has occurred.31,34,35
The most frequently identiﬁed precipitating event is infection. Patients with cirrhosis have greatly increased risks of severe bacterial infection and are twice as likely to die from sepsis as are non-cirrhotic people.36–41 40–50% of hospital admissions for patients with cirrhosis are because of sepsis; the most common infections are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.38,40 30% of patients die within a month of admission and another 30% are dead at 1 year.37 By contrast with the substantially improved outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and primary variceal bleeding, survival in those with severe sepsis seems to have improved little in the past 20 years.11,37 Predisposition for sepsis in cirrhosis is multifactorial. Genetic predisposition, particularly for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, is associated with speciﬁc polymorphic variants of NOD2 and TLR2.42 A highly complex pattern of compromised cellular and humoral immune defences and immunodeﬁciency coexist, which worsens with increasing severity of liver disease.41,43–48
The role and importance of portal hypertensive variceal bleeding as a precipitant seems to be changing. Mortality rates associated with variceal bleeding have fallen substantially in the past 20 years, and are now often less than 20%, and a strong evidence base for therapy has been developed.13,14,49,50 Early deaths and acute-on-chronic liver failure after variceal bleeding now usually occur only in patients with advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade C); mortality in early-stage disease (grade A) is now less than 5%.50–52 These improvements are a result partly of improved initial care and early endoscopy and partly of management of basic principles of airway, breathing, and circulation to prevent procedure-related aspiration and pneumonia (detailed discussion is outside the scope of this Seminar).50,51,53 Infection is closely associated with bleeding due to portal hypertension: potential mechanisms include increases in portal pressure, impairment of liver function, and haemostatic derangement.54,55 Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the likelihood of early rebleeding and improves survival, and should be given routinely to patients presenting with acute variceal haemorrhage.51,53,56,57
Other precipitants can independently or in concert trigger acute-on-chronic liver failure. In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, an alcohol binge and development of acute alcoholic hepatitis can bring on the disease, although this mechanism remains contentious. Other precipitants include hepatotoxic drugs, hepatic injury from ischaemia after hypotension or congestion from cardiac failure, or acute infection with hepatitis A and E viruses (especially in the Middle East and Asia).58

Response The systemic inﬂammatory response is a hallmark of acute-on-chronic liver failure. In the CANONIC study, increased white cell count at admission to hospital was an independent predictor of mortality and a key way to diﬀerentiate the disorder from acute decompensation. This increase in white cell count seemed to be independent of the presence of conﬁrmed bacterial infection or a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis—ie, it represented a non-speciﬁc response to inﬂammation. Mortality progressively increased with increasing white cell count at admission (appendix).4
Immune responses of patients with cirrhosis that progresses to organ failure are abnormal. An initial pro-inﬂammatory cytokine response can occur, in parallel with or followed by a prolonged and inappropriate period of so-called immune paralysis, predisposing to secondary nosocomial infection.45,59–61

Immune paralysis is common in acute-on-chronic liver failure, correlates with severity of organ failure and risk of sepsis, and is associated with notably increased mortality.44,45,59,62,63
Organ failure Although basic mechanisms of development and progression of acute-on-chronic liver failure are unclear, liver parenchymal cell injury and death are probably important at an early stage. Mechanisms and extent of cell injury or death might vary depending on underlying cause and precipitating event.
Histopathology
With the exception of changes noted in acute alcoholic hepatitis, the hepatic histopathological aspects of acuteon-chronic liver failure are poorly deﬁned, and few studies have been done.64 The limited results available suggest heterogeneity in appearance—unsurprising in view of the complexity and varied nature of underlying illnesses and precipitants (ﬁgure 5). Speciﬁc ﬁndings seem to relate closely to systemic manifestations of the disorder and to survival. In a prospective study, 65 transjugular liver biopsies taken from 54 patients with alcoholic liver disease within 72 h of development of

acute-on-chronic liver failure were compared with 48 biopsies from patients with chronic hepatic decompensation undergoing elective transplant assessment. Ductular cholestasis, cholangiolitis, Mallory-Denk bodies, hepatocellular ballooning, and steatosis were signiﬁcantly more frequent in the acute-on-chronic group than in the transplant group, and ductular cholestasis was signiﬁcantly related to the presence of systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome and independently related to mortality. Review of liver biopsies from 50 patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure of various causes showed a similarly complex histological pattern; ﬁbrosis, ductular proliferation, and apoptosis were independently associated with poor outcome.66
In a study of patients in China with hepatitis B virus cirrhosis,33 histopathological review of 174 livers removed at transplantation showed areas of sub-massive hepatic necrosis in 40% of patients, correlating with clinical measures of liver injury and acute-on-chronic liver failure severity. Necrosis occurred most often in patients with viral reactivation or bacterial sepsis.33 Coagulative necrosis of regenerative nodules in patients with chronic liver disease resulting from ischaemia has been described in paediatric patients with biliary atresia and congenital hepatic ﬁbrosis or adult patients with alcoholic liver disease, variceal bleeding, and hypotension.67,68 The overall pattern of histological features shows the underlying chronic liver disease and superimposed eﬀects of not only precipitants including sepsis and ischaemia, but also disordered hepatic regeneration and recovery.
Inﬂammation
Hepatic inﬂammation is closely related to liver cell injury and necrosis and contributes both to systemic inﬂammatory status and to the development and severity of portal hypertension.69–72 In cirrhosis, the presence of portal hypertension results in splanchnic vasodilation and altered ﬂow into the portal circulation; hepatic inﬂammation results in further increased vascular resistance in the intrahepatic circulation and increased arterio-venous shunting.70,72–74 These changes could exacerbate systemic translocation of gut-derived microorganisms into the circulation and contribute to the induction of the systemic inﬂammatory response and evolution of extrahepatic organ dysfunction in acute-on-chronic liver failure.75 Hepatic inﬂammatory state could be a target for future therapies in some patients.76 Anti-inﬂammatory drugs have been tested in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis: anti-tumournecrosis-factor antibody therapy (inﬂiximab) acutely reduced the severity of portal hypertension and improved hepatic perfusion. Corticosteroids are also beneﬁcial, and poor response to corticosteroids suggests that patients are unlikely to survive with medical therapy alone.77,78

Supportive care
Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure and substantial organ dysfunction or failure are best cared for in a critical care environment. Most clinical care does not diﬀer substantially from that deployed in other critically ill patients. Rapid identiﬁcation and treatment of the precipitant and the delivery of supportive care that addresses all aspects of evolving or established multiple organs systems failure are basic principles of management. Microcirculatory dysfunction and tissue hypoxia or dysoxia are probably central to this process.79 Clinical management includes rapid restoration of metabolic and haemodynamic stability and provision of nutritional support, in tandem with organ-speciﬁc supportive care. In many patients, such an approach will result in resolution of organ failure and hepatic recompensation.
Infection
Infection is the key precipitant and presents major challenges. When bacterial infection is suspected, prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics improves survival. In a study of more than 600 patients with cirrhosis in septic shock, mortality progressively increased for each hour of delay before antibiotic therapy after onset of hypotension (appendix) and was higher when the ﬁrst antibiotics given were inappropriate (adjusted odds ratio 9·5, 95% CI 4·5–20·7).80 In hospital patients with cirrhosis, rates of fungal colonisation are high, but invasive infection is uncommon. Prophylactic antifungal therapy in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure is generally not advised unless other predisposing factors, such as immunosuppression, are present. Invasive aspergilloisis infection is increasingly recognised as a cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute alcoholic cirrhosis given corticosteroids, in whom candidaemia and cytomegalovirus infection can also occur.81
Cardiovascular failure
Cardiovascular failure in acute-on-chronic liver failure is associated with very high mortality (often >50%).19 In cirrhosis, cardiac output is high and systemic vasodilation is common, eﬀects which are thought to relate to low-level intestinal bacterial translocation and increased circulating concentrations of vasoactive and proinﬂammatory mediators.34 Patients can have increased total blood volume, but distribution is dysfunctional, and they usually have eﬀective central hypovolaemia. Small decreases in arterial tone after infective or inﬂammatory insults can rapidly precipitate hypotension.8 Low-grade cardiac diastolic dysfunction (a feature of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy) is present in as many as half of patients with cirrhosis, but its relation to circulatory and renal failure in acute-on-chronic liver failure is not well characterised.82–84 Although the main causes of hypotension are hypovolaemia and vasodilatation,

reduction in cardiac output from baseline that is unresponsive to ﬂuid therapy can occur in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, and predicts high risk of death.8,73,85 Management of such patients is complex and necessitates interventions based on echocardiographic ﬁndings and invasive haemodynamic monitoring.
Choice of ﬂuid for intravenous volume repletion remains controversial. Albumin is a multifunctional circulating protein that is reduced in quantity and altered in function in acute-on-chronic liver failure but its role as intravenous ﬂuid therapy is unclear.63,86,87 In patients at risk of acute-on-chronic liver failure from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, prophylactic intravenous albumin could reduce the incidence of renal failure and liver failure and improve survival, although this survival beneﬁt has not been noted for patients with established disease and other bacterial infections.88,89 In hypotension unresponsive to intravenous ﬂuid challenge, noradrenaline and vasopressin receptor agonists are often used, but more data are needed to inform choice of vasoconstrictors.8,90
Adrenal insuﬃciency is reported in as many as 75% of critically ill patients with cirrhosis and severe sepsis, which correlates with functional liver reserve and disease severity and is closely associated with haemodynamic instability, development of renal failure, and increased mortality.91,92 Use of supplemental corticosteroids for septic shock in acute-on-chronic liver failure speeds up reversal of shock and vasopressor requirement, but no survival beneﬁt has been shown.93,94 A large randomised clinical trial of corticosteroid supplementation in acuteon-chronic liver failure is underway.95

For the randomised clinical trial see https://www. clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctrsearch/trial/2010-024273-38/CZ

Renal failure
Renal dysfunction (kidney injury) frequently complicates acute-on-chronic liver failure, is closely linked to the presence of systemic inﬂammatory state, and is of major prognostic importance.4,24,96 Hepatorenal syndrome represents a liver-speciﬁc functional renal failure with high mortality, resulting from the combination of marked sympathetic and neurohumoral systems’ activation, with splanchnic vasodilatation, systemic hypotension, and intense renal vasoconstriction.97
However, renal failure in acute-on-chronic liver failure is not a single diagnosis: in nearly 500 patients in hospital with cirrhosis and clinically signiﬁcant renal dysfunction, 3 month survival was only 15% in those developing hepatorenal syndrome, but these patients accounted for only 13% of all cases.98 Patients with cirrhosis whose renal failure had other causes were more than twice as likely to survive. In view of the clinical importance and complexity of renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, new consensus criteria for acute kidney injury have been proposed; these criteria are based on dynamic changes in serum creatinine concentrations and deﬁne stages of severity, progression, regression, and response to treatment.99 Analysis of urinary biomarkers can help to further subclassify renal failure in patients with cirrhosis.100

Seminar

An algorithm for the management of acute kidney injury has codiﬁed many of the practices in current use (appendix).99 Use of drugs with nephrotoxic eﬀects and radiological contrast agents is avoided in patients at risk of kidney injury. However, appropriate cross-sectional imaging should be done if needed; renal function should be closely monitored.8,97 In some settings, antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce risk of hepatorenal syndrome and improve survival.101 In patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, early use of pentoxifylline and N-acetylcysteine could reduce the risk of renal dysfunction, but this hypothesis was not supported in large randomised controlled trials.77,102–104
Bacterial infection is a frequent precipitant of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis; infection should always be looked for, and thresholds for antibiotics should be low.97 Plasma volume expansion is done in patients with clinically suspected hypovolaemia, although the choice of ﬂuids is based on clinical judgment (as is use of vasopressors). Intravenous albumin and terlipressin are frequently given in combination, resulting in expansion of circulating volume, increased systemic blood pressure, reversal of splanchnic vasodilation, improved renal perfusion, and possible non-colloidal albumin-speciﬁc eﬀects.8,97 Results of randomised controlled trials105–109 suggest reversal of hepatorenal syndrome in as many as half of patients given this combination, and an improvement in short-term survival, although survival beneﬁts were not shown in a large 2014 trial. 109
Cerebral eﬀects
Changes in consciousness as a result of hepatic encephalopathy are frequent in acute-on-chronic liver failure and range from mild sleepiness, confusion, and agitation to frank coma. These changes indicate very impaired underlying hepatic function. More than 60% of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to hospital with a ﬁrst episode of hepatic encephalopathy are dead within a year.2,110 In those with acute-on-chronic liver failure, encephalopathy is strongly and independently related to an increased risk of death, but clinically relevant cerebral oedema is very rare.4,111,112 Current pathogenetic models of hepatic encephalopathy focus on the combined eﬀects of genetic factors and neurotoxic eﬀects, mainly as a result of hyperammonaemia, hyponatraemia, and systemic inﬂammation.111
Removal of neurotoxins, including ammonia, from the circulation is impaired in hepatic failure. Their cerebral eﬀects are increased by systemic inﬂammatory mediators that modulate cerebral endothelial, vascular, and astrocytic function.111 In patients with cirrhosis, infection often triggers or worsens hepatic encephalopathy; encephalopathy, the systemic inﬂammatory response, and extrahepatic organ failure are closely associated.113
Initial clinical management of hepatic encephalopathy in acute-on-chronic liver failure is focused on protection of the airway; endotracheal intubation is indicated if the

patient’s conscious level decreases. Treatment of precipitating factors—such as sepsis, constipation, dehydration, hyponatraemia, and other electrolyte imbalance—and discontinuation of any contributory drugs are essential.114 Generic treatments, such as lactulose, to reduce nitrogen absorption from the intestine are often commenced, but their role and that of non-absorbable antibiotics, including rifaximin, is currently unclear or has not been assessed in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure.114,115 Protein restriction is not beneﬁcial and could worsen an already compromised nutritional state.116 Drugs that rapidly lower ammonia concentrations, such as enteral polyethylene glycol, have shown promise, and other drugs speciﬁcally targeting ammonia (eg, ornithine phenylacetate) are under investigation.117,118 In controlled trials in acute-on-chronic liver failure, extracorporeal liver support with a molecular adsorbent recirculating system transiently decreases the severity of encephalopathy but does not improve survival.119,120
Coagulation defects
Coagulation status is always abnormal in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, but the functional consequences are uncertain. Standard coagulation assays, including prothrombin time or international normalised ratio, are poorly predictive of bleeding complications, as a result of the complex coagulation disturbance noted in patients with chronic liver disease.121–124 Dynamic functional assays could provide a better overview of complication risk and guide to treatment. Blood coagulation can be rebalanced by the parallel reduction of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, and, rather than hypocoagulopathy, a prothrombotic state can occur.125 This balance is fragile and unstable and secondary factors, such as infection, can tip it towards either haemorrhage or thrombosis.
Altered coagulation status with enhanced bleeding risk can result from the eﬀects of systemic homoeostatic disturbance from acidosis, uraemia, hypocalcaemia, hypothermia, or sepsis. Addressing of these systemic issues forms the basis of initial management of active haemorrhage and prevention of procedure-related bleeding complications. Approaches to coagulation support should be individualised but, in general, fresh frozen plasma is not recommended for empirical correction of prolongation of clotting times and is associated with adverse eﬀects including volume overload, increased portal pressure, and transfusion reactions.126,127 Thrombocytopenia is common in acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure but does not always represent a bleeding risk because of concomitant high circulating concentrations of von Willebrand factor and increased platelet adhesion.128 However, hypocoagulabilty could be more common in patients with chronic liver disease and a platelet count of less than 100 × 10⁹ per litre or hypoﬁbrinogenaemia, and support might be needed in those with bleeding complications or who require invasive procedures.129

Other therapies
Liver transplantation Survival after liver transplantation is worse for recipients who are in hospital at the time of surgery than in those at home, and worse still in those who were in the intensive care unit; post-transplantation length of stay and resource use are also substantially increased.130–134 In patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, diﬃculties in urgent transplantation assessment, active substance dependence, paucity of organ donors, sepsis, and circulatory failure often preclude emergency liver transplantation. In the CANONIC study,4 9% of patients with acute-onchronic liver failure underwent transplantation within 28 days of admission, and 15% within 90 days.4 In patients in whom two or three other organs had also failed, mortality without liver transplantation was more than 80%, but only 20% in patients who received a transplant. The success of liver transplantation in some patients with corticosteroid-resistant acute alcoholic hepatitis shows that excellent outcomes can be obtained if appropriate recipients can be selected for transplantation.135 Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure seem to tolerate marginal liver grafts remarkably well, but increasing recipient age (particularly >60 years) is consistently associated with increased mortality.136–138
However, transplantation is usually an option only in patients assessed and listed for transplantation before they develop acute-on-chronic liver failure. Even then, only a proportion are eligible because of progression of illness or development of contraindications. Of 221 Canadian patients listed for liver transplantation who deteriorated and needed intensive care, 106 (48%) died while awaiting surgery.138 Previously, organ allocation systems did not prioritise speciﬁcally on the basis of acute-on-chronic liver failure, but introduction of the Share 35 protocol in the USA gave new wait-list priority to regional candidates with MELD of 35 or greater, which reduced waitlist mortality by 30% and did not result in an increase in post-transplant mortality.139 Use of scoring systems speciﬁc for acuteon-chronic liver failure could help to further reﬁne this process.21 Expedited transplantation assessment should be also be considered for survivors of acute-on-chronic liver failure after discharge from the intensive care unit because such an episode of disease substantially increases medium-term mortality.2,4,24,27,37
Extracorporeal liver support devices The use of various biological and non-biological extracorporeal liver support devices has been explored in acute-on-chronic liver failure. These aim to replace the functions of the failing liver, allowing hepatic recovery or stabilising clinical state to enable transplantation.140,141
Non-biological systems remove from the blood the toxins that potentially cause hepatic injury and extra-hepatic organ failure—including bilirubin, ammonia, and bile acids—through membrane ﬁltration

and adsorption. Two large randomised controlled trials of non-biological devices have been done. In the Recompensation of Exacerbated Liver Insuﬃciency with hyperbilirubinemia and/or Encephalopathy and/or renal Failure (RELIEF) multicentre study,119 189 patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure were randomly assigned to standard medical therapy with or without the use of a molecular adsorbent recirculating system (a form of whole-blood albumin dialysis with charcoal and anion-exchange resin adsorbent columns in series with standard renal replacement, which removes both watersoluble and protein-bound toxins).140 Use of the molecular adsorbent recirculating system resulted in biochemical changes and improved resolution of encephalopathy, but did not signiﬁcantly improve survival in either intention-to-treat or per-protocol analysis.119 The Prometheus device combines a plasma separation technique with adsorption and renalreplacement components and more eﬀectively clears protein-bound and water-soluble molecules than does albumin dialysis.142 However, in a randomised controlled trial143 of 145 patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, those in whom Prometheus was used in addition to standard medical therapy had signiﬁcant reductions in serum bilirubin concentrations but no improvements in survival.143
In biological liver support systems, biochemically active hepatocyes support not only hepatic detoxiﬁcation but also metabolic and synthetic functions.140 The hepatocyte type and its structural arrangement present challenges, as does maintenance of the large mass of cells. These technical issues along with cost have delayed large-scale eﬃcacy testing in acute-on-chronic liver failure, and randomised controlled trials have been reported only in abstract form.140 These devices are of little use in the treatment of acute-on-chronic liver failure, but the technology is continuously evolving and large-scale trials of new biological systems are ongoing. Even if these devices do not improve overall survival, speciﬁc patient subgroups might beneﬁt from their use (eg, stabilisation of the patient until transplantation),141 and trials are focused on speciﬁc subgroups of acute-onchronic liver failure.
Improving outcomes
Outcomes for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure have substantially improved, but further improvements are dependent on advances that address key steps in disease evolution. Testing and reﬁnement of the deﬁnitions of the disorder will help with research and intervention trials and contribute to incremental improvement in supportive care, as has already been achieved with variceal bleeding. As the design and application of extracorporeal devices improve on the basis of better understanding of acute-on-chronic liver failure, they could lead to clinically meaningful outcomes. Transplantation could be eﬀectively used in more patients.

However, the greatest improvements in survival will probably result from development and implementation of steps to identify the patients with cirrhosis at greatest risk for organ failure at an early stage and introduction of eﬀective interventions to prevent this development. Because of the major contribution of, and persistently high mortality associated with, bacterial infection, sepsis and host inﬂammatory response are important targets for both improved diagnostics and early therapeutic interventions. Assessment of treatment strategies and improvements in outcomes are dependent upon increased access to critical care for a group of patients who are often unfairly disadvantaged.9,10
