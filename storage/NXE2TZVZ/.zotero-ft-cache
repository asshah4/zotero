If one accepts that the fundamental pursuit of genetics is to determine the genotypes that explain phenotypes, the meteoric increase of DNA sequence information applied toward that pursuit has nowhere to go but up. The recent introduction of instruments capable of producing millions of DNA sequence reads in a single run is rapidly changing the landscape of genetics, providing the ability to answer questions with heretofore unimaginable speed. These technologies will provide an inexpensive, genome-wide sequence readout as an endpoint to applications ranging from chromatin immunoprecipitation, mutation mapping and polymorphism discovery to noncoding RNA discovery. Here I survey next-generation sequencing technologies and consider how they can provide a more complete picture of how the genome shapes the organism.

    Figure 1.  454 Workflow: library construction ligates 454-specific adapters to DNA fragments and couples amplification beads with DNA in an emulsion PCR to amplify fragments before sequencing. The beads are loaded into the picotiter plate (PTP). The bottom panel illustrates the pyrosequencing reaction that occurs on nucleotide incorporation to report sequencing by synthesis.

    Figure 2.  Illumina workflow. Starting from similar fragmentation and adapter ligation steps, the library is added to a flow cell for bridge amplification (an isothermal process that amplifies each fragment into a cluster). The cluster fragments are denatured, annealed with a sequencing primer and subjected to sequencing by synthesis using 3′ blocked labeled nucleotides.

    Figure 3.  AB SOLiD sequencing. (a) AB SOLiD sequencing by ligation first anneals a universal sequencing primer then goes through subsequent ligation of the appropriate labeled 8mer, followed by detection at each cycle. (b) Two base encoding of the AB SOLiD data greatly facilitates the discrimination of base calling errors from true polymorphisms or indel events.
