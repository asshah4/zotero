Abstract 
Using neuroimaging technologies to compare normal weight and obese individuals can reveal much about the pathophysiological state of obesity but such comparisons tell us little about what makes some normal weight individuals susceptible to obesity or about important individual differences amongst obese individuals. The current review therefore reviews neuroimaging research on individual difference measures that can illuminate these important topics. After introducing three neuropsychological models of the nature of motivation to approach rewarding stimuli, neuroimaging research on measures of impulsivity, craving, binge eating, restrained eating and disinhibited eating is reviewed. Although neuroimaging research on individual differences measures of brain activity related to appetite is in its infancy, existing studies suggest that such research could enrich the understanding, prevention and treatment of disordered eating and obesity.

Abstract 
Recently, there has been a convergence in lesion and neuroimaging data in the identification of circuits underlying positive and negative emotion in the human brain. Emphasis is placed on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala as two key components of this circuitry. Emotion guides action and organizes behavior towards salient goals. To accomplish this, it is essential that the organism have a means of representing affect in the absence of immediate elicitors. It is proposed that the PFC plays a crucial role in affective working memory. The ventromedial sector of the PFC is most directly involved in the representation of elementary positive and negative emotional states while the dorsolateral PFC may be involved in the representation of the goal states towards which these elementary positive and negative states are directed. The amygdala has been consistently identified as playing a crucial role in both the perception of emotional cues and the production of emotional responses, with some evidence suggesting that it is particularly involved with fear-related negative affect. Individual differences in amygdala activation are implicated in dispositional affective styles and increased reactivity to negative incentives. The ventral striatum, anterior cingulate and insular cortex also provide unique contributions to emotional processing.

Abstract 
Several neuropsychological hypotheses have been formulated to explain the transition to addiction, including hedonic allostasis, incentive salience, and the development of habits. A key feature of addiction that remains to be explored is the important individual variability observed in the propensity to self-administer drugs, the sensitivity to drug-associated cues, the severity of the withdrawal state, and the ability to quit. In this review, we suggest that the concept of self-regulation, combined with the concept of modularity of cognitive function, may aid in the understanding of the neural basis of individual differences in the vulnerability to drugs and the transition to addiction. The thesis of this review is that drug addiction involves a failure of the different subcomponents of the executive systems controlling key cognitive modules that process reward, pain, stress, emotion, habits, and decision-making. A subhypothesis is that the different patterns of drug addiction and individual differences in the transition to addiction may emerge from differential vulnerability in one or more of the subcomponents.

Abstract 
The brain circuitry underlying emotion includes several territories of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and related structures. In general, the PFC represents emotion in the absence of immediately present incentives and thus plays a crucial role in the anticipation of the future affective consequences of action, as well as in the persistence of emotion following the offset of an elicitor. The functions of the other structures in this circuit are also considered. Individual differences in this circuitry are reviewed, with an emphasis on asymmetries within the PFC and activation of the amygdala as 2 key components of affective style. These individual differences are related to both behavioral and biological variables associated with affective style and emotion regulation. Plasticity in this circuitry and its implications for transforming emotion and cultivating positive affect and resilience are considered.

Abstract 
This commentary provides reflections on the current state of affairs in research on EEG frontal asymmetries associated with affect. Although considerable progress has occurred since the first report on this topic 25 years ago, research on frontal EEG asymmetries associated with affect has largely evolved in the absence of any serious connection with neuroscience research on the structure and function of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC). Such integration is important as this work progresses since the neuroscience literature can help to understand what the prefrontal cortex is “doing” in affective processing. Data from the neuroscience literature on the heterogeneity of different sectors of the PFC are introduced and more specific hypotheses are offered about what different sectors of the PFC might be doing in affect. A number of methodological issues associated with EEG measures of functional prefrontal asymmetries are also considered.

Behavioural Brain Research , Volume 215, Issue 1, December 2010, Pages 95-101 
 
Abstract 
In mice, emotional adaptation might be assessed by changes in behavioural responses towards novelty over time (i.e. habituation), with non-adaptive anxiety being expressed by a lack of habituation. Recently we found that male 129P3/J mice showed such a profound lack of habituation in comparison to male BALB/c mice. From these results we concluded that male 129P3/J mice might model non-adaptive, i.e. pathological anxiety. As a first step in the process of assessing the generalizability of our results, we investigated whether these results were robust across gender. Therefore we replicated our previous study in female individuals. Results from the present study reveal behavioural habituation towards novelty, i.e. an adaptive phenotype in female BALB/c mice. In contrast, females of the 129P3/J strain were characterised by a lack of habituation, similar as their male counterparts. Compared to female BALB/c, female 129P3/J mice showed lower neural activity in brain areas known to regulate the integration of emotional and cognitive processes. Extending the results found in males, female 129P3/J mice revealed increased post-testing plasma corticosterone levels and higher neural activity in brain areas related to emotional processing than females of the BALB/c strain. Taken together our results demonstrate that both genders of the 129P3/J mouse strain are characterised by a non-adaptive anxiety phenotype, strengthening the hypothesis that the 129P3/J strain may be a promising (neuro)-behavioural model for pathological anxiety. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract 
In order to evaluate the influence of changes in affective state on light-enhanced startle, the effects of positive affect, induced by acute cocaine administration, and the effect of negative affect, induced by spontaneous cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety, were studied. Acute cocaine administration decreased LES, whereas withdrawal from chronic cocaine administration exacerbated LES 24 h after withdrawal, an effect indicative of increased anxiety. This exacerbated LES was reduced, but not back to normal, 4 days after withdrawal. The finding that both cocaine-induced positive and negative affect can be detected in LES, suggests that this may be a valuable tool in studying affect regulation in rodents. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract 
A polymorphism of the human Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene that produces a valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met) is linked to adult anxiety and mood disorders, possibly through effects on brain circuitry function. Associations between BDNF gene variants and brain activity have not been explored in anxious and depressed adolescents. The current study investigated the association between BDNF genotype and amygdala-hippocampal responses to emotional stimuli in adolescents with anxiety disorders and/or major depressive disorder (MDD) and in healthy adolescents. Twenty-seven unmedicated patients with acutely-impairing current anxiety disorders and/or MDD and 31 healthy adolescents, matched on age, gender and IQ, rated their fear of fearful, angry, neutral and happy facial expressions during collection of fMRI data on the amygdala and hippocampus. Left and right amygdala and hippocampal responses were analyzed using repeated-measures analyses of variance models, with diagnosis (patients, healthy) and genotype (Met-carriers, Val/Val homozygotes) as between-group factors and facial expression (fearful, angry, neutral, happy) as a within-subject factor. Significant effects of diagnosis and diagnosis-by-genotype interactions (F's > 4, p's < 0.05) characterized activations in amygdala and anterior hippocampal regions. Greater activations in patients than healthy adolescents were found. Critically, these hyperactivations were modulated by BDNF genotype: Met-carriers showed greater neural responses of emotional faces than Val/Val homozygotes in patients only. These data are first to demonstrate the contribution of BDNF gene variants to the neural correlates of adolescent anxiety and depression. Early "gene-brain" linkages may lay the foundation for longer-term patterns of neural dysfunction in affective disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract 
Stress alters many psychological and behavioral processes. In humans, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that long-term exposure to stress can lead to structural changes in brain areas, which are important in cognitive and emotional functions. Animal studies have extended these observations to the cellular level, showing that neurons within discrete regions of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala demonstrate significant morphological plasticity in response to chronic stress. Though stress-induced changes in brain and behavior are largely reversible, some effects may be permanent. Given the clear role of stress in psychological and behavioral dysfunctions, a greater understanding of the effects of stress on the brain is essential.

Abstract 
As early as the first year of life, developmental changes are found in prefrontal cortex and in the cognitive abilities dependent on prefrontal cortex. However, prefrontal cortex, and the cognitive abilities that depend on it, continue to develop until early adulthood. The ages of roughly 12 months, 6 to 7 years, and 10 to 11 years appear to be watersheds in the development of prefrontal cognitive abilities. Prefrontal cortex is required when concerted concentration is needed—exactly those times when going on ‘automatic pilot’ is not possible or would lead to error. This article focuses on two of the abilities dependent on prefrontal cortex: working memory and inhibitory control, the abilities needed to hold in mind what you should do and to resist doing what you should not. For each age period (0–1, 1–3, 3–7, and 7–22), advances in these abilities are discussed and then changes in prefrontal anatomy and biochemistry during that age period are discussed.

Abstract 
Neuroscientific research has identified a fundamental role for the amygdala and striatum in goal-directed behavior – the way in which representations of value guide prospective behavior by influencing thoughts, planning, and action selection. There are clear implications for such a system in aberrant behavioral control, as seen in addiction. However, neither the amygdala nor striatum are unitary structures and subregions of these structures play dissociable, yet complimentary, roles in affective processing. The position of the amygdala and ventral striatum at the anatomical head of corticostriatal circuitry allows them a preeminent role in enabling affect-laden stimuli to influence goals and behavior.

Abstract 
Limbic forebrain regions are anatomically positioned to integrate cortical and subcortical processing streams that mediate cognitive and emotional functions. Feedback projections to sensory cortices bias perceptual systems to process stimuli of high significance. The amygdala is critical for learning contingencies in the environment that predict emotional outcomes and for modulating explicit memory processes in the hippocampus. The anterior cingulate gyrus and ventromedial and orbital prefrontal cortices serve as interfaces that link emotional information processing and attentional control systems to guide goal-directed behavior. Dysregulation of the balance between affective and cognitive systems is a hallmark of anxiety and mood disorders.

Abstract 
 
This article reviews the modern literature on two key aspects of the central circuitry of emotion: the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala. There are several different functional divisions of the PFC, including the dorsolateral, ventromedial, and orbital sectors. Each of these regions plays some role in affective processing that shares the feature of representing affect in the absence of immediate rewards and punishments as well as in different aspects of emotional regulation. The amygdala appears to be crucial for the learning of new stimulus-threat contingencies and also appears to be important in the expression of cue-specific fear. Individual differences in both tonic activation and phasic reactivity in this circuit play an important role in governing different aspects of anxiety. Emphasis is placed on affective chronometry, or the time course of emotional responding, as a key attribute of individual differences in propensity for anxiety that is regulated by this circuitry.

Introduction 
 
Biobehavioral scientists are increasingly recognizing the importance of emotion for the fundamental tasks of survival and adaptation ( Damasio ; Ekman and Pinker ). Emotion modulates memory, facilitates decision making, influences learning, and provides the motivation for critical action in the face of environmental incentives. Emotion is also the stuff of individual differences. It is a key component, if not the major ingredient, for many of the fundamental dimensions of personality and vulnerability factors that govern risk for psychopathology ( Davidson and Davidson ). In this article, evidence on the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala as key structures in a circuit that govern positive and negative affect and affective style will be reviewed, with an emphasis on mechanisms responsible for individual differences in vulnerability to anxiety disorders. It should be noted at the outset that these brain regions are part of a larger circuit that includes the anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and insula, each of which contribute uniquely to subcomponents of emotion and variations in affective style (see Davidson et al 2000b ). 
The central circuitry of emotion 
The prefrontal cortex 
 
Though approaching the topic from very different perspectives, a growing body of literature is converging on the idea that there exist two fundamental systems that underlie approach and withdrawal-related emotion and motivation, or positive and negative affect ( Cacioppo ; Davidson ; Gray ; Lang and Schneirla ). The precise description of these systems differs somewhat across investigators as does the anatomical circuitry that is featured, but the essential elements are quite similar in each of these different proposals. The approach system has been described by Davidson and Irwin (1999a) as facilitating appetitive behavior and generating particular types of positive affect that are approach-related, such as the emotion occurring as an organism moves closer toward a desired goal. The withdrawal system, on the other hand, facilitates the withdrawal of an organism from sources of aversive stimulation and/or organizes appropriate responses to cues of threat. This system also generates withdrawal-related negative emotions, such as disgust and fear. A variety of evidence indicates that these systems are implemented in partially separable circuits, and it is to this evidence that we now turn. Our focus will be on two key components of this circuitry: the PFC and the amygdala. For more extensive discussion of this entire circuitry, including other regions not considered here, see Davidson and Irwin (1999a) . 
 
A large corpus of data at both the animal and human levels implicate various sectors of the PFC in emotion. The PFC is not a homogeneous zone of tissue but rather has been differentiated on the basis of both cytoarchitectonic as well as functional considerations. The three subdivisions of the primate PFC that have been consistently distinguished include the dorsolateral, ventromedial, and orbitofrontal sectors. In addition, there appear to be important functional differences between the left and right sides within each of these sectors. 
 
The case for the differential importance of left and right PFC sectors for emotional processing was first made systematically in a series of studies on patients with unilateral cortical damage ( Gainotti ; Robinson and Sackeim ). Each of these studies compared the mood of patients with unilateral left- or right-sided brain damage and found a greater incidence of depressive symptoms following left-sided damage. In most cases, the damage was fairly gross and likely included more than one sector of PFC and often included other brain regions as well. The general interpretation that has been placed upon these studies is that depressive symptoms are increased following left-sided anterior PFC damage, because this brain territory participates in a process that underlies certain forms of positive affect and when damaged, leads to deficits in the capacity to experience positive affect, a hallmark feature of depression ( Watson et al 1995 ). Though most of the extant lesion data are consistent with this general picture (see Robinson and Downhill 1995 for a review), some inconsistencies have also appeared (e.g., Gainotti and House ). Davidson (1993) has reviewed in detail these studies and has addressed a number of critical methodological and conceptual concerns in this literature. The most important of these issues is that according to the diathesis-stress model of anterior activation asymmetry proposed by Davidson and colleagues (e.g., Davidson ; Davidson and Henriques ), individual differences in anterior activation asymmetry, whether lesion-induced or functional, represent a diathesis. As such, they alter the probability that specific forms of emotional reactions will occur in response to the requisite environmental challenge. In the absence of such a challenge, the pattern of asymmetric activation will simply reflect a propensity but will not necessarily culminate in differences in mood or symptoms. In a recent study with the largest sample size to date ( n = 193) for a study of mood sequelae in patients with unilateral lesions, Morris and Morris found that among stroke patients, it was only in those with small-sized lesions that the relation between left PFC damage and depressive symptoms was observed. It is likely that larger lesions intrude on other brain territories and mask the relation between left PFC damage and depression. 
 
A growing corpus of evidence in normal intact humans is consistent with the findings derived from the lesion evidence. Davidson and his colleagues have reported that induced positive and negative affective states shift the asymmetry in prefrontal brain electrical activity in lawful ways. For example, film-induced negative affect increases relative right-sided prefrontal and anterior temporal activation ( Davidson et al 1990 ), whereas induced positive affect elicits an opposite pattern of asymmetric activation. Similar findings have been obtained by others (e.g., Ahern ; Jones and Tucker ). In addition, we will review in the next section a body of evidence that supports the conclusion that individual differences in baseline levels of asymmetric activation in these brain regions are associated with dispositional affective style. Using an extended picture presentation paradigm designed to evoke longer-duration changes in mood ( Sutton et al 1997a ), we measured regional glucose metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) to ascertain whether similar patterns of anterior asymmetry would be present using this very different and more precise method to assess regional brain activity ( Sutton et al 1997b ). During the production of negative affect, we observed right-sided increases in metabolic rate in anterior orbital, inferior frontal, middle, and superior frontal gyri, whereas the production of positive affect was associated with a pattern of predominantly left-sided metabolic increases in the pre- and postcentral gyri. Using PET to measure regional cerebral blood flow, Hugdahl and his colleagues ( Hugdahl and Hugdahl ) reported a widespread zone of increased blood flow in the right PFC, including the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral cortices and inferior and superior cortices during the extinction phase after learning had occurred compared with the habituation phase, before the presentation of the experimental contingencies. 
 
Other investigators have used clinical groups to induce a stronger form of negative affect in the laboratory than is possible with normal control subjects. One common strategy for evoking anxiety among anxious patients in the laboratory is to present them with specific types of stimuli that are known to provoke their anxiety (e.g., pictures of spiders for spider phobics; making a public speech for social phobics). Davidson et al (2000a) , in a study using brain electrical activity measures, have recently found that when social phobics anticipate making a public speech, they show large increases in right-sided anterior activation. Pooling across data from three separate anxiety disordered groups, Rauch et al (1997) found two regions of the PFC that were consistently activated across groups: the right inferior PFC and right medial orbital PFC. 
 
The ventromedial PFC has been implicated in the anticipation of future positive and negative affective consequences. Bechara and his colleagues ( Bechara et al 1994 ) have reported that patients with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial PFC that also included some intrusion into the orbital frontal cortex have difficulty anticipating future positive or negative consequences, although immediately available rewards and punishments do influence their behavior. Such patients show decreased levels of electrodermal activity in anticipation of a risky choice compared with control subjects, whereas control subjects exhibit such autonomic change before they explicitly know that it is a risky choice ( Bechara ; Bechara and Bechara ). 
 
The findings from the lesion method when effects of small unilateral lesions are examined and from neuroimaging studies in normal subjects and patients with anxiety disorders converge on the conclusion that increases in right-sided activation in various sectors of the PFC are associated with increased negative affect. Less evidence is available for the domain of positive affect, in part because positive affect is much harder to elicit in the laboratory. The findings from Bechara et al on the effects of ventromedial PFC lesions on the anticipation of future positive and negative affective consequences are based on studies of patients with bilateral lesions. It will be of great interest in the future to examine patients with unilateral ventromedial lesions to ascertain whether valence-dependent asymmetric effects are present for this sector of PFC as well. 
 
Systematic studies designed to disentangle the specific role played by various sectors of the PFC in emotion are lacking. Many theoretical accounts of emotion assign it an important role in guiding action and organizing behavior toward the acquisition of motivationally significant goals (e.g., Frijda and Levenson ). This process requires that the organism have some means of representing affect in the absence of immediately present rewards and punishments and other affective incentives. Such a process may be likened to a form of affective working memory. It is likely that the PFC plays a key role in this process (see e.g., Watanabe 1996 ). Damage to certain sectors of the PFC impair an individual’s capacity to anticipate future affective outcomes and consequently result in an inability to guide behavior in an adaptive fashion. Such damage is not likely to disrupt an individual’s responding to immediate cues for reward and punishment, only the anticipation before and sustainment after an affective cue is presented. This proposal can be tested using current neuroimaging methods (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) but has not yet been rigorously evaluated. With regard to the different functional roles of the dorsolateral and ventromedial sectors of the PFC, Davidson and Irwin (1999a) suggested on the basis of considering both human and animal studies, that the latter sector is most likely involved in the representation of elementary positive and negative affective states in the absence of immediately present incentives, whereas the former sector is most directly involved in the representation of goal states toward which these more elementary positive and negative states are directed. Although the dorsolateral PFC is not typically viewed as a prefrontal sector that is connected with emotion and motivation, recent single unit work strongly supports this view. Hikosaka and Watanabe (2000) recorded from single neurons in the orbital and dorsolateral PFC in monkeys during a delay period while they anticipated reward. Neurons in both the orbital and dorsolateral sectors of the PFC showed delay period activity that varied with the nature of the reward. The difference between the properties of neurons in the dorsolateral and orbital PFC was that the former showed delay period activity that varied as a function of both spatial working memory and reward expectation, whereas the latter exhibited reward-dependent variation only. Hikosaka and Watanabe (2000) suggest that because the connections between the lateral PFC and amygdala are sparse ( Barbas 1995 ), the processes related to reward expectation may first occur in the orbital frontal cortex and then information be transmitted to the lateral PFC, where integration of emotional and cognitive operations would occur. 
The amygdala 
 
A large corpus of research at the animal—mostly rodent—level has established the importance of the amygdala for emotional processes (e.g., Aggleton ; Cahill and LeDoux ). Because many reviews of the animal literature have appeared recently, a detailed description of these studies will not be presented here. LeDoux and his colleagues have marshaled a large corpus of compelling evidence to suggest that the amygdala is necessary for the establishment of conditioned fear. Whether the amygdala is necessary for the expression of that fear following learning and whether the amygdala is the actual locus where the learned information is stored is still a matter of some controversy ( Cahill and Fanselow ). Also not resolved is the extent to which the amygdala participates in all learning of stimulus-incentive associations, both negative and positive, and whether there are functional differences between the left and right amygdala ( Davidson and Irwin 1999a ). The classic view of amygdala damage in nonhuman primates resulting in major affective disturbances as expressed in the Kluver-Bucy syndrome where the animal exhibits abnormal approach, hyper-orality and sexuality, and little fear, is now thought to be a function of damage elsewhere in the medial temporal lobe. When very selective excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala are made that preserve fibers of passage, nothing resembling the Kluver-Bucy syndrome is observed ( Kalin and Meunier ). The upshot of this diverse array of findings is to suggest a more limited role for the amygdala in certain forms of emotional learning, though the human data imply a more heterogeneous contribution. 
 
Although the number of patients with discrete lesions of the amygdala is small, they have provided unique information on the role of this structure in emotional processing. A number of studies have now reported specific impairments in the recognition of facial expressions of fear in patients with restricted amygdala damage ( Adolphs ; Broks and Calder ). Recognition of facial signs of other emotions was found to be intact. In a study that required subjects to make judgments of trustworthiness and approachability of unfamiliar adults from facial photographs, patients with bilateral amygdala damage judged the unfamiliar individuals to be more approachable and trustworthy than did control subjects ( Adolphs et al 1998 ). Recognition of vocalic signs of fear and anger was found to be impaired in a patient with bilateral amygdala damage ( Scott et al 1997 ), suggesting that this deficit is not restricted to facial expressions. Other researchers ( Bechara et al 1995 ) have demonstrated that aversive autonomic conditioning is impaired in a patient with amygdala damage, despite the fact that the patient showed normal declarative knowledge of the conditioning contingencies. Collectively, these findings from patients with selective bilateral destruction of the amygdala suggest specific impairments on tasks that tap aspects of negative emotion processing. Most of the studies have focused on the perceptual side, where the data clearly show the amygdala to be important for the recognition of cues of threat or danger. The conditioning data also indicate that the amygdala may be necessary for acquiring new implicit autonomic learning of stimulus-punishment contingencies. In one of the few studies to examine the role of the amygdala in the expression of already-learned emotional responses, Angrilli and colleagues ( Angrilli et al 1996 ) reported on a patient with a benign tumor of the right amygdala in an emotion-modulated startle study. Among control subjects, they observed the well-known effect of startle potentiation during the presentation of aversive stimuli. In the patient with right amygdala damage, no startle potentiation was observed in response to aversive versus neutral stimuli. These findings suggest that the amygdala might be necessary for the expression of already learned negative affect. 
 
Since 1995, a growing number of studies using PET and fMRI to investigate the role of the amygdala in emotional processes have begun to appear. Many studies have reported activation of the amygdala detected with either PET or fMRI when anxiety-disordered patients have been exposed to their specific anxiety-provoking stimuli compared with control stimuli (e.g., Breiter and Rauch ). When social phobics were exposed to neutral faces, they showed activation of the amygdala comparable to what was observed in both the phobics and control subjects in response to aversive compared with neutral odors ( Birbaumer et al 1998 ). Consistent with the human lesion data, a number of studies have now reported activation of the amygdala in response to facial expressions of fear compared with neutral, happy, or disgust control faces ( Breiter ; Morris ; Morris and Phillips ). In the Breiter et al (1996b) fMRI study, they observed rapid habituation of the amygdala response, which may provide an important clue to the time-limited function of the amygdala in the stream of affective information processing. In a recent study, Whalen and his colleagues ( Whalen et al 1998 ) observed activation of the amygdala in response to masked fear faces that were not consciously perceived. Unpleasant compared with neutral and pleasant pictures have also been found to activate the amygdala ( Irwin and Lane ). Finally, a number of studies have reported activation of the amygdala during early phases of aversive conditioning ( Buchel ; LaBar and Morris ). Amygdala activation in response to several other experimental procedures for inducing negative affect has been reported, including unsolvable anagrams of the sort used to induce learned helplessness ( Schneider et al 1996 ), aversive olfactory cues ( Zald and Pardo 1997 ), and aversive gustatory stimuli ( Zald et al 1998 ). Other data on individual differences in amygdala activation and their relation to affective style will be treated in the next section. 
 
The findings from both the lesion studies and neuroimaging on the role of the amygdala in affective processes raise a number of important questions about the functional significance of amygdala activation and precise role this structure may play in human emotion. One key question is whether the amygdala is implicated in all emotion, negative affect in particular or fear most specifically. Most neuroimaging studies that have induced actual emotion find greater amygdala activation to negative compared with positive elicitors. In a study of the effects of cocaine on cocaine addicts, Breiter et al (1997) report significant deactivation in the amygdala during self-reported “highs” following the administration of cocaine. Of the studies that have examined amygdala activation in response to facial expressions, all have consistently found greater activation in response to fear compared with other emotional faces, though a complete range of other emotions has not been sampled. Whalen (1999) has interpreted these data within a model that assigns a primary role for the amygdala in the detection of ambiguity. According to this model, preferential activation of the amygdala is observed in response to fear versus anger faces, because the former convey threat though the source of the threat is ambiguous, whereas angry faces convey a threat but the source of the threat is unambiguous. Although some data are consistent with this view, other data indicating that bilateral destruction of the amygdala impairs recognition of both fear and anger vocal expression ( Scott et al 1997 ) are not. Other recent human imaging findings, however, suggest that the amygdala may be importantly involved in positive affect as well. For example Beauregard and his colleagues ( Beauregard et al 2001 ) used fMRI to measure activations produced by erotic film clips in normal male subjects and found activation in the amygdala, anterior temporal pole, and hypothalamus during a passive viewing condition. 
 
Another important question raised but not answered by the new findings on the amygdala is whether there are reliable functional asymmetries in this region. During the experimental arousal of negative affect, some investigators report changes in activation in the left amygdala (e.g., Schneider et al 1997 ), some report changes in the right amygdala (e.g., Rauch et al 1996 ) and some report bilateral changes (e.g., Irwin et al 1996 ). Morris et al (1998) have proposed on the basis of a masking study that the right amygdala is involved in unconscious processing of emotional learning, whereas the left amygdala is more involved in conscious emotional learning. There are data at the rodent level that suggest that there might be important functional differences between left versus right amygdala lesions ( Coleman and Coleman ). One crucial issue in the human neuroimaging literature is the need to perform the proper statistical comparisons to ascertain whether true asymmetric effects are present. This requires a test of the interaction between Condition and Hemisphere. Virtually none of the studies in the human neuroimaging literature have performed this crucial test (see Davidson and Irwin 1999b for an extensive discussion of this issue). 
 
Finally, an issue left unaddressed in the human data is whether the amygdala is required for the ongoing expression of affect or whether it is specifically involved in only the initial acquisition of emotional learning. The fact that amygdala activation is present during early phases of conditioning and then appears to rapidly habituate ( Buchel and LaBar ) is consistent with the idea that the amygdala may be required only in the initial stages of learning. We ( Kalin et al 2001 ) have recently performed studies in rhesus monkeys tested before and after very discrete excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala, which preserve fibers of passage and destroy only cell bodies. Complete destruction of the amygdala in these animals results in a dramatic attenuation of behavioral signs of fear in response to a snake; however, such lesions do not have any noticeable impact on freezing in response to a human intruder paradigm (see Kalin and Shelton 1989 ), nor do the lesions affect any of the biological correlates that have been found to be associated with an anxious endophenotype, including right prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) activation or high levels of baseline cortisol ( Kalin et al 1998 ). Collectively, these findings imply that the amygdala may be crucial for learning new stimulus-threat contingencies and may be important in the expression of cue-specific fear; however, the amygdala does not appear to be necessary for the expression of already acquired individual differences in temperament or affective style. 
Affective style 
 
Davidson and Davidson has used the term affective style to refer to the broad range of individual differences in different subcomponents of affective reactivity and dispositional mood. This is a very global term, and it is imperative to specify with more precision which particular system one is measuring affective reactivity in and which subcomponent of reactivity is being targeted for study. For example, one could measure affective reactivity in different response systems by using startle magnitude, MR signal change in the amygdala, or ratings on a self-report scale as the measure. Each of these obviously reflects activity in very different systems, and activation in these systems will not necessarily cohere. What is meant by subcomponent of reactivity has been articulated in detail in Davidson (1998a) and includes the following parameters: tonic level, threshold to respond, peak or amplitude of response, rise time to peak of response, and recovery time. These are not meant to necessarily reflect an exhaustive list of subcomponents; they are merely offered as examples. Each of these subcomponents can potentially be studied in different response systems, leading to many parameters of affective style. We know virtually nothing about the psychometric characteristics of measures of these different parameters, except for self-report measures (for two recent efforts examining different subcomponents of affective style in two different physiologic response systems, see Larson and Tomarken ), though this information is crucial if we are to develop rigorous measures of these constructs. In this section, we review data on the contributions of individual differences in prefrontal and amygdala function to affective style. 
 
In two decades of previous research, we have performed a large number of studies designed to examine the role of activation asymmetries in prefrontal cortex and other anterior cortical zones in aspects of affective style. This work has been reviewed recently ( Davidson ; Davidson ; Davidson and Davidson ), and only highlights will be presented here. Using measures of scalp-recorded brain electrical activity, we found that indices of activation asymmetry based on power spectral measures were stable over time and exhibited excellent internal consistency reliability ( Tomarken et al 1992b ) thus fulfilling a number of important psychometric criteria for an index of a traitlike construct. In a series of studies, we found that there are large individual differences in the magnitude and direction of baseline asymmetric activation in brain electrical activity measures obtained from prefrontal scalp regions in both infants ( Davidson and Fox 1989 ) and adults ( Davidson and Tomarken 1989 ). In 10-month old infants we found that those with greater relative right-sided prefrontal activation in prefrontal scalp regions were more likely to cry in response to a brief period of maternal separation compared with their left-activated counterparts ( Davidson and Fox 1989 ). In toddlers and young children, we have observed that those individuals with greater relative right-sided prefrontal activation show more behavioral inhibition and wariness measured through laboratory-based behavioral observation ( Davidson and Rickman 1999 ). In adults, we have found that individual differences in such measures predict dispositional mood ( Tomarken et al 1992a ), self-report measures of behavioral activation and inhibition ( Sutton and Davidson 1997 ), repressive defensiveness ( Tomarken and Davidson 1994 ), reactivity to positive and negative emotion elicitors ( Tomarken and Wheeler ), baseline immune function ( Kang et al 1991 ), and reactivity of the immune system to emotional challenge ( Davidson et al 1999b ). In recent work ( Larson et al 1998 ) we found that individual differences in electrophysiological measures of prefrontal asymmetry predicted the magnitude of recovery following a negative affective stimulus. These data suggest that the prefrontal cortex may play a role in regulating the timecourse of emotional responding and/or in the active inhibition of negative affect. 
 
We have also found that individual differences in these brain electrical measures of anterior asymmetry are associated with mood and anxiety disorders. In particular, we have found that depressed subjects and individuals who are currently euthymic but have a history of past depression exhibit less left prefrontal activation compared with never-depressed control subjects ( Henriques and Henriques ). We have also found that when social phobics anticipate making a public speech, they show large increases in right-sided prefrontal activation, though they do not differ from control subjects at baseline ( Davidson and Davidson ). 
 
In a series of studies with Kalin ( Davidson ; Davidson and Kalin ), we have demonstrated that similar activation asymmetries can be measured in rhesus monkeys and that they predict similar types of behavior and biology as we observe in humans. In the most recent efforts of this kind, we found that animals with greater relative right-sided prefrontal activation exhibit higher basal levels of the stress hormone cortisol ( Kalin et al 1998 ) and higher cerebrospinal fluid levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( Kalin et al 2000 ). Similar data have recently been reported in humans (Buss et al 1997). 
 
Recent studies in rodents also have uncovered asymmetries in prefrontal function that closely resemble those that have been studied in humans and nonhuman primates. Of most relevance to the work summarized above, Sullivan and Gratton (1999) reported that in acutely restrained rats, right or bilateral but not left medial prefrontal cortical lesions decreased corticosterone levels. Stress ulcer development after a single cold restraint stress was greatly reduced by either right or bilateral medial PFC lesions but was unaffected by left-sided lesions. These authors conclude that their data “suggest a preferential role for the right [medial] PFC in activating physiologic stress responses” (p. 2839). 
 
A number of our original EEG observations have now been independently replicated by others ( Ahern ; Allen ; Dawson ; Harmon ; Jacobs and Wiedemann ), though a few studies have appeared reporting only partial replications of aspects of our original findings ( Hagemann and Reid ). Davidson (1998b) has called attention to a number of crucial methodological and conceptual issues in these replication attempts and suggests that the difficulties in replication are at least in part a function of significant methodological limitations; however, it is also clear that with respect to asymmetries associated with mood and anxiety disorders, considerable heterogeneity exists in the forms of these psychopathologies, only some of which would be expected to show differences in prefrontal asymmetries compared with control subjects. Moreover, few studies using neuroimaging to address the role of prefrontal asymmetries in affective processes have appeared. As noted by Davidson and Irwin (1999a) , only a very small handful of studies using PET or fMRI have conducted the proper statistical comparison to uncover asymmetry effects in their data. They ( Davidson and Irwin 1999a ) comment on the complexity of performing these analyses. Because the structural anatomy is not symmetrical, particularly for cortical tissue, it is very difficult to extract homologous regions for asymmetry analyses. The size of the regions may differ on the two sides of the brain, the anatomical homologue may not be in exactly the same location in each hemisphere, and the shape of the cortical territory on each side of the brain is often different. These facts present formidable methodological obstacles when using neuroimaging to make inferences about patterns of asymmetric activation. 
 
The data from the Larson et al (1998) study referred to above indicated that individuals with greater relative left-sided prefrontal activation at baseline have greater recovery of startle potentiation following the offset of a negative stimulus. Moreover, the measure of asymmetric prefrontal activation accounted for more variance in the magnitude of startle postnegative-stimulus offset (i.e., startle recovery) than it did during the stimulus. These findings imply that individual differences in prefrontal activation asymmetry may play a role in regulating the time course of emotional responding and that those individuals with more left-sided prefrontal activation may recover more quickly from negative affect or stress than their right-activated counterparts. 
 
A clue to the mechanism that may underlie this consequence of left prefrontal activation is provided by a study from LeDoux’s laboratory, where they found that rats with lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex show dramatically slower extinction of a learned aversive response compared with sham operated control subjects ( Morgan et al 1993 ; but see Gewirtz et al 1997 ). These findings imply that there is a descending pathway between the medial PFC and the amygdala ( Amaral et al 1992 ) that is inhibitory and thus represents an active component of extinction. In the absence of this normal inhibitory input, the amygdala remains unchecked and continues to remain activated. Whether this inhibitory input from the medial PFC is an important component of the prominent habituation observed in the amygdala remains to be clarified. Davidson (1998a) has suggested that in humans and possibly other primates, the major inhibitory influence on the amygdala may derive from the left prefrontal cortex. Consistent with this idea, recent PET findings suggest that in normal human subjects, glucose metabolism in the left medial and lateral prefrontal cortex is reciprocally coupled to metabolic activity in the amygdala, such that those subjects with decreased left prefrontal metabolic rate have increased metabolic rate in the amygdala ( Abercrombie et al 1996 ). We propose that this mechanism may be responsible for the failure to recover quickly from negative events and the lengthening of its time course in those individuals who appear to be more vulnerable. Such an affective style may be associated a predisposition to develop anxiety disorders. 
 
The two key features of the circuitry underlying positive and negative affect highlighted in this review are the PFC and the amygdala. In the section above, studies on the basic function of the amygdala in affective behavior were considered. Here the question is raised about individual differences in amygdala function and its relation to affective style. Although most research on the amygdala has emphasized its phasic function, there is a tonic level of activation in the amygdala that can be assessed with PET measures of regional glucose metabolism. Using MRI-based coregistration, we can draw regions-of-interest around the amygdala on an MR scan coregistered to the PET image and extract metabolic activity in such small regions without using any spatial filtering of the PET image. This provides higher resolution than could ordinarily be achieved using conventional cross-subject aggregation methods that require spatial smoothing of the images (see Abercrombie and Schaefer ). Using such procedures, we have found that individual differences in metabolic activity in the right amygdala in particular predict dispositional negative affect on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al 1988 ) in a group of depressed patients ( Abercrombie et al 1998 ). Using the same measure of negative affect, we (Irwin et al, unpublished data) have also found MR signal change in the amygdala in response to negative versus neutral stimuli accounts for a substantial amount of variance in PANAS trait negative affect scores ( r = .63). Other researchers have found that individual differences in right amygdala glucose metabolic rate in response to emotional films predict the recall of negative emotional films assessed 3 weeks following the PET procedure. Those individuals with higher levels of glucose metabolism in the right amygdala recalled more of the negative film clips ( Cahill et al 1996 ). Other investigators using both PET ( Furmark et al 1997 ) and fMRI ( LaBar et al 1998 ) reported that those subjects with greater activation in the amygdala during classic aversive conditioning showed greater evidence of electrodermal conditioning. Ketter et al (1996) using the anesthetic procaine as a pharmacological challenge reported that those individuals who had a dysphoric response to the drug had significantly greater activation of the amygdala compared with subjects exhibiting a euphoric response. Moreover, amygdala blood flow correlated positively with fear and negatively with euphoria on self-report measures of emotional intensity. 
 
Some of the data reviewed above on relations between amygdala activation and dispositional negative affect appear at least on the surface to be inconsistent with the animal and human neuroimaging data reviewed above implying that the amygdala is important only in the initial learning of stimulus-threat associations but not in the expression of preexisting temperamental variation, such as behavioral inhibition. For example, in our own data using PET-derived measures of glucose metabolism in the amygdala ( Abercrombie et al 1998 ), we found that subjects with greater metabolic rate in the right amygdala report higher levels of dispositional negative affect as assessed by the PANAS. A similar association was found using the identical affect measure with fMRI where subjects showing larger MR signal increases in the amygdala in response to negative versus neutral pictures reported higher levels of dispositional negative affect. The PANAS requires subjects to rate a series of single-word adjectives on a 1–5 point scale to indicate the extent to which that emotion is present during their daily life. Thus, in these experiments, it appears that activation levels in the amygdala are associated with the expression of a preexisting affective style. We believe the key to resolving this apparent inconsistency among these findings lies in a more in-depth understanding of the strategies people use to respond to questionnaires like the PANAS. When subjects are asked to make global inferences about the affective dispositions that are extended in time, they are not veridical integrators of the momentary affective states that unfolded over the period in question. Rather, as a number of commentators have forcefully argued, they exhibit systematic heuristic biases that reflect the information that is accessible at the time (see Kahneman and Schwarz ). In particular, in a series of elegant studies, Kahneman (1999) has demonstrated that individuals tend to adopt what he refers to as the “peak-end” rule for forming these retrospective affective evaluations. Thus, although an individual might be asked to rate how “nervous” he was during the past month, he is likely to weight excessively information about the peak episode of nervousness during this period, as well as his level of nervousness very recently. The peak intensity of the emotion in question may be especially related to amygdala activation, because it is likely to represent a response to a particularly threatening or novel episode. Such complexities in measuring subjective aspects of emotion underscores the need to develop more objective measures that do not depend on self-report and that can better capture the time course of emotional responding or what Davidson (1998a) has referred to as affective chronometry. 
 
The fact that there exist reliable individual differences in baseline metabolic rate in the amygdala also requires comment in light of the earlier discussion about the amygdala’s role in phasic affective processes. There is clearly intrinsic neural activity in the amygdala, even during sleep ( Maquet et al 1996 ). As a number of studies have now shown, baseline nontask (“resting”) levels of activation in the amygdala are associated with dispositional negative affect ( Abercrombie et al 1998 ) and depression ( Drevets et al 1992 ). Whether these baseline differences in amygdala activation reflect activation in response to the PET environment or whether such differences predict the magnitude of task-induced activation in the amygdala in response to emotion elicitors are questions that must be addressed in future research. We believe that when PET is used to measure baseline differences in amygdala activation, at least for the right amygdala, it likely reflects an important influence of the experimental situation itself. This claim is made on the basis of the fact that our recent evidence ( Schaefer et al 2000 ) using MR-coregistration to extract glucose metabolic rate in several subcortical regions revealed that test-retest reliability over a 6-month period is excellent for all subcortical regions we examined (hippocampus, caudate, thalamus, left amygdala) except for the right amygdala. These findings are consistent with the idea that situational influences are important in modulating activation in the right amygdala. 
Implications and conclusions 
 
On the basis of findings from several new studies reviewed above, we have suggested ( Davidson 2000b ) that at least one important component of what the ventromedial and/or orbital prefrontal cortex “does” in affective responding is modulate the time course of emotional responding, particularly recovery time. There are several facts critical to making this claim. First, there are extensive reciprocal connections between amygdala and PFC, particularly the medial and orbital zones of prefrontal cortex ( Amaral et al 1992 ). The glutamatergic efferents from PFC likely synapse on γ-aminobutyric acid neurons ( Amaral et al 1992 ) and thus provide an important inhibitory input to the amygdala. Second, LeDoux and his colleagues ( Morgan et al 1993 ; but see Gewirtz et al 1997 ) demonstrated in rats that lesions of medial prefrontal cortex dramatically prolong the maintenance of a conditioned aversive response. These findings imply that the medial PFC normally inhibits the amygdala as an active component of extinction. In the absence of this normal inhibitory input, the amygdala remains unchecked and continues to maintain the learned aversive response. Other work on shifts in behavior following reward devaluation also underscore the importance of interaction between the amygdala and orbital PFC ( Baxter et al 2000 ). Third are the data cited above indicating that individual differences in prefrontal activation asymmetry significantly predict the magnitude of the poststimulus startle following removal of the variance attributable to startle magnitude during the presentation of the emotional picture. In particular, left prefrontal activation appears to facilitate two processes simultaneously: 1) it maintains representations of behavioral-reinforcement contingencies in working memory ( Thorpe et al 1983 ); and 2) it inhibits the amygdala. In this way, the time course of negative affect is shortened while the time course of positive affect is accentuated. And finally, findings using PET indicate that in normal subjects, glucose metabolism in left medial and lateral PFC is reciprocally associated with glucose metabolic rate in the amygdala ( Abercrombie et al 1996 ). Thus, subjects with greater relative right-sided sided prefrontal metabolism have higher metabolic activity in their amygdala. These findings are consistent with the lesion study of LeDoux and colleagues and imply that prefrontal cortex plays an important role in modulating activity in the amygdala. Increased activation in both right prefrontal and amygdala regions have been reported for several types of anxiety disorders, and the increase in amygdala activation that has been reported in depressed patients may be associated primarily with anxiety symptoms that are often found to be co-morbidly associated with depression. 
 
Data were also presented that indicate individual differences in both tonic glucose metabolism and phasic activation in response to aversive stimuli in the amygdala. These individual differences predict dispositional negative affect. Whatever modulatory influence the prefrontal cortex might have over the amygdala, it appears that the magnitude of phasic activation of the amygdala by aversive stimuli accounts for a substantial portion of variance in self-reported dispositional negative affect, considerably more than any of our measures of prefrontal function. Thus, the proximal control of dispositional negative affect is likely to be more closely associated with amygdala function than with prefrontal function. 
 
In light of the contributions of various sectors of the PFC and amygdala to affective style, is there specificity of this part of the circuitry for anxiety per se? And how are we to understand the many ways in which anxiety is expressed and the specific types of anxiety disorders that have been described? These are questions to which firm answers are not yet available; however, based on the extant literature, it is fair to say that there may be certain elements that are common across anxiety disorders that may be reflected in common neural substrates. For example, increased vigilance toward threat-related stimuli that have the capacity to stop ongoing behavior and re-orient processing capacity to address a perceived threat may be somehow generic to many anxiety disorders and may be reflected in tonically elevated activation of certain sectors of the right PFC, as Rauch and colleagues ( Rauch et al 1997 ) have demonstrated across several different anxiety disorders. The specific stimuli that have the capacity to elicit increase in right-sided PFC and amygdala activation may vary as a function of learning; however, once these associations become learned, the cascade of central changes the learned cues produce may be similar across different anxiety disorders. Having argued for an invariant core that may be associated with some aspects of anxiety-related symptomato
