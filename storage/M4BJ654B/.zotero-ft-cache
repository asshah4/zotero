Background—Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute heart failure syndrome characterized by myocardial hypocontractility from the mid left ventricle to the apex. It is precipitated by extreme stress and can be triggered by intravenous catecholamine administration, particularly epinephrine. Despite its grave presentation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rapidly reversible, with generally good prognosis. We hypothesized that this represents switching of epinephrine signaling through the pleiotropic ␤2-adrenergic receptor (␤2AR) from canonical stimulatory G-protein–activated cardiostimulant to inhibitory G-protein–activated cardiodepressant pathways.
Methods and Results—We describe an in vivo rat model in which a high intravenous epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, bolus produces the characteristic reversible apical depression of myocardial contraction coupled with basal hypercontractility. The effect is prevented via Gi inactivation by pertussis toxin pretreatment. ␤2AR number and functional responses were greater in isolated apical cardiomyocytes than in basal cardiomyocytes, which confirmed the higher apical sensitivity and response to circulating epinephrine. In vitro studies demonstrated high-dose epinephrine can induce direct cardiomyocyte cardiodepression and cardioprotection in a ␤2AR-Gi– dependent manner. Preventing epinephrine-Gi effects increased mortality in the Takotsubo model, whereas ␤-blockers that activate ␤2AR-Gi exacerbated the epinephrine-dependent negative inotropic effects without further deaths. In contrast, levosimendan rescued the acute cardiac dysfunction without increased mortality.
Conclusions—We suggest that biased agonism of epinephrine for ␤2AR-Gs at low concentrations and for Gi at high concentrations underpins the acute apical cardiodepression observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with an apical-basal gradient in ␤2ARs explaining the differential regional responses. We suggest this epinephrine-specific ␤2AR-Gi signaling may have evolved as a cardioprotective strategy to limit catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity during acute stress.

T here has been a rapid increase in the recognition of a syndrome of acute and severe but reversible heart failure called Takotsubo or stress cardiomyopathy,1–3 also known as broken heart syndrome, which usually follows within hours of an identifiable emotional, psychological, or physical stress. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy mimics symptoms of acute myo-

cardial infarction but is distinguished by the lack of coronary occlusion and by characteristic regional wall-motion abnormalities, classically a virtual apical ballooning appearance caused by a hypercontractile base of the heart relative to hypokinetic or akinetic apical and mid left ventricular myocardium, the latter extending beyond a single coronary artery territory.1,2 Initial

recognition in earthquake survivors in Japan, plus the characteristic ventricular shape, led to the Takotsubo (meaning octopus pot) label.3,4 Approximately 1% to 2% of all presentations with suspected acute coronary syndrome cases are ultimately diagnosed as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.3
Clinical Perspective on p 706
The pathophysiological mechanisms for this increasingly recognized syndrome are not known. Evidence points to epinephrine as the precipitating factor. Physical or psychological stress is a frequent precipitant, and serum catecholamine levels in Takotsubo patients 1 to 2 days after presentation are higher than those in patients with myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema; epinephrine returns to myocardial infarction levels only after 7 to 9 days.1 Catecholamine storms, more associated with epinephrine-secreting pheochromocytomas than norepinephrine- and dopaminesecreting pheochromocytomas,5 can also precipitate Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.6 In particular, the reproduction of the signs of Takotsubo by accidental administration of epinephrine (including single intramuscular 1-mg doses from an epinephrine autoinjector, or EpiPen) is most indicative of its central role.7 Although there is significant mortality in the early period (1%–1.5%), there is also a characteristic rapid (days to weeks) recovery of patients who survive the acute period of profound depression in left ventricular contractile function,1 with excellent prognosis and absent or minimal residual cardiac impairment. This striking difference from the normal prognosis of heart failure led us to propose previously that the cardiodepression has elements derived from a beneficial physiological protective adaptation.8 Thus, the syndrome has interest for the cardiologist over and above the design of optimal treatment for the individual Takotsubo patient.
We have previously proposed a mechanism based on 2 overarching principles for which there is prior evidence. First, the mammalian left ventricle contains apical-basal gradients of ␤-adrenergic receptors (␤ARs) and sympathetic innervation, with the apex characterized by highest ␤AR and lowest sympathetic nerve density.8 Rat, feline, rabbit, and dog left ventricles show increased apical responses to global highdose isoproterenol challenges,9–12 with increased apical versus basal ␤AR levels measured directly in the dog ventricle.10 This pattern results in increased apical responsiveness to circulating catecholamines, predominantly epinephrine from the adrenal glands, as a compensatory mechanism for the sparse apical sympathetic innervation, to ensure optimal ventricular ejection during times of stress. Conversely, sympathetic innervation is highest in the basal myocardium and lowest in the apex and therefore cannot explain the localized apical dysfunction. This is also true of human left ventricle,13 although the presence of a ventricular cardiomyocyte ␤AR gradient in the human heart remains to be determined.
Second, epinephrine, at high levels, can act as a negative inotrope via ligand-mediated trafficking of the ␤2AR from stimulatory G protein to inhibitory G protein subcellular signaling pathways. The ␤2AR is widely reported as being pleiotropic, having the potential to couple through Gs-adenylate cyclase-cAMP (like the ␤1AR) but also though Gi␣, G␤␥, and non–G-protein pathways.14,15 ␤2AR-Gi–mediated depres-

sion of contraction was initially demonstrated with transgenic

mice that overexpressed ␤2AR (TG␤2).16,17 At high epinephrine concentrations, the ␤2AR switches its coupling from Gs protein to an inhibitory Gi protein,16 a process described as ligand- or stimulus-directed trafficking, or biased agonism.

This switch would be favored in conditions of high catechol-

amine stress because it depends on ␤2AR phosphorylation by both protein kinase A (PKA)18 and G-protein receptor–

coupled kinases (GRKs).19 This is particularly relevant given

the increased frequency of the L41Q GRK5 polymorphism,

known to increase cardiac GRK5 activity and ␤AR phosphor-

ylation, in a recent study that genotyped patients with

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.20 The negative inotropic effect

through

G 21,22 i

has

contributions

both

from

inhibition

of

Gs-cAMP production and through other pathways such as p38

mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) alteration of myo-

filament sensitivity.23 No such role for ␤1ARs in this Gs-Gi trafficking switch has been documented, and the phenomenon

is epinephrine specific. Norepinephrine has 20-fold lower

affinity for the ␤2AR compared to the ␤1AR, with much weaker ␤2AR stimulus trafficking to the Gi pathway.16
Although this negative inotropy is detrimental from a mechan-

ical perspective, the Gs-to-Gi switch is potentially both antiapoptotic and antiarrhythmic24,25 and may represent a cardioprotec-

tive mechanism against ␤1AR-catecholamine cardiotoxicity. Both the p38 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt

pathways have been implicated in ␤2AR-Gi–mediated antiapoptotic effects in adult cardiac myocytes,26,27 and evidence for

increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt activation has

been reported in myocardial biopsy samples from patients with

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy during the acute phase.28 Interest-

ingly, direct negative inotropic effects of some ␤-blockers in

human ventricular cardiomyocytes have been shown to depend

on ␤2AR-Gi signaling,29 an observation that may have implications for their use in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

In the present study, we have developed an epinephrine-

induced in vivo model of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy that

reproduces both the apically located negative inotropism and

the reversible nature of this cardiodepression. We have used

this to explore the role of ␤2AR apical-basal gradients, the involvement of Gi signaling, and the cardioprotective nature of this condition. It has been supplemented by an in vitro

model of acute epinephrine exposure to explore underlying

cellular mechanisms. Potential pharmacological agents have

been assessed in terms of treatment of the established

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with the intention to mitigate the

cardiodepression without disrupting any of the cardioprotec-

tive elements of the syndrome.

Methods
All studies complied with the United Kingdom Home Office regulation governing the care and use of laboratory animals and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).
In Vivo Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Model
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 250 –350 g) were anesthetized and injected with epinephrine 4.28ϫ10Ϫ8 mol/100 g or norepinephrine 1.43ϫ10Ϫ7 mol/100 g via the right jugular vein as a

bolus injection. Regional left ventricular responses were recorded by 2-dimensional echocardiography (VisualSonics Vevo 770) in the parasternal long axis. Baseline scans were performed before catecholamine administration. For preventative studies, a subgroup of animals were pretreated with the Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX; 25 ␮g/kg), the p38 MAPK antagonist SB203580 (0.1–10 ␮g/kg), or the ␤2AR-selective antagonist ICI-118,551 (1 ␮g/kg) followed by intravenous epinephrine bolus. A separate cohort of case animals had continuous aortic blood pressure recording during the protocol with a 1.9F pressure-volume catheter (Scisense Inc). For rescue strategies, a subgroup of animals were treated with intravenous propranolol (1.43ϫ10Ϫ11 mol/100 g), carvedilol (1.43ϫ10Ϫ11 mol/100 g), or levosimendan infusion (4.7 ␮g ⅐ kgϪ1 ⅐ minϪ1) 15 minutes after epinephrine injection.
Rat Cardiomyocyte Isolation and ␤2AR-Overexpression Studies
Myocytes were isolated from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Bicester, United Kingdom; weight, 250 –350 g) by the standard enzymatic technique described previously.30 Isolated rat cardiomyocytes were plated in culture medium at a field density of 10 000 cells/well and infected with either adenovirus containing ␤2AR and green fluorescent protein (Ad.␤2AR.GFP); ␤2AR with mutations at the PKA phosphorylation sites 261, 262, 345, and 346 S/A (␤2AR-PKA-KO; Ad.␤2AR-PKA-KO); or adenovirus containing GFP (Ad.GFP; control) at a multiplicity of infection of 500 for 48 hours. For PTX treatment, Ad.␤2AR.GFP-infected rat ventricular myocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of PTX (1.5 ␮g/mL) for 48 hours. Survival in culture was shown as a percentage of rod-shaped myocytes at the time of plating; Ͼ100 cells per well were counted, with triplicates for each condition. ␤2AR-specific contractile responses were measured on separately isolated apical and basal ventricular cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol (1 ␮mol/L) plus the ␤1AR-selective antagonist CGP20712A (300 nmol/L; online-only Data Supplement).21,29
In Vitro Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Model
Freshly isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were perfused with epinephrine (100 nmol/L) for 20 minutes followed by washout (10 minutes). A subgroup of cells were preincubated with PTX (1.5 ␮g/mL) for 3 hours at 35°C.
␤AR Radioligand Binding Assay
Cell membranes, prepared from apical- and basal-derived adult rat cardiomyocytes, were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in assay buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, 5 mmol/L MgCl2; pH 7.4), with 0.1 to 10 nmol/L of the nonselective ␤AR radioligand [125I]-cyanopindolol ([125I]-CYP; Amersham) and increasing concentrations of the selective ␤2AR antagonist ICI-118,551 (1ϫ10Ϫ11 to 1ϫ10Ϫ2 mol/L). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 ␮mol/L of the nonselective ␤AR antagonist propranolol.
Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer–Mediated cAMP Assay
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies in EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP)-cAMPs expressing apical and basal ventricular cardiomyocytes were performed as described previously.31 Whole-cell epinephrine-stimulated ␤2ARmediated cAMP transients were recorded. A subgroup of cells were preincubated with PTX (1.5 ␮g/mL) for 3 hours at 35°C.
Human Tissue Samples and Cardiomyocyte Isolation
Left or right ventricular tissues were obtained from failing human hearts at the time of heart transplantation; procedures for collecting human heart tissues conformed to the ethics committee requirements of the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital. Written informed consent was provided by all patients. The investigation conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Single human

ventricular myocytes were isolated from explanted failing human hearts by a standard enzymatic technique as described previously.32
Cardiomyocyte Contractility Studies
The online-only Data Supplement contains a detailed Methods section.
Statistical Methods
Results are shown as meanϮSEM. Differences between cell responses for different treatments were determined by paired or unpaired Student t tests for 2 conditions or by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for Ն2 conditions. Concentration-response curves were compared by repeated-measures ANOVA. Comparisons between responses to bolus epinephrine and norepinephrine or with or without PTX, ␤-blockers, or levosimendan were performed by repeated-measures ANOVA with time as a second factor. For individual time points after bolus, significant changes in fractional shortening compared with the preadministration period are indicated; P values less significant than PϽ0.01 are not shown because of the multiple comparisons. Differences in mortality were analyzed with the ␹2 test, with Fisher exact test for small numbers. P values of Յ0.05 are taken as significant.
Results
High-Dose Epinephrine Injection Recapitulates Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy High serum epinephrine levels are a common feature in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients, which suggests a mechanistic link. We developed a model of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in which an anesthetized rat received an intravenous (jugular) bolus of epinephrine 4.3ϫ10Ϫ8 mol/100 g (equivalent to Ϸ5 mg in an adult human). Intravenous bolus delivery was selected to mimic the human physiological response to sudden high stress. Initial dose-response curves determined the highest catecholamine dose without excessive mortality (online-only Data Supplement Figure I). Epinephrine bolus triggered a rapid hypertensive response with reflex bradycardia within seconds of administration, which stabilized to normotension after several minutes (online-only Data Supplement Figure II) and was associated with an initial global increase in left ventricular contractility (Figure 1); however, this declined and yielded a marked decrease in cardiac contraction, initiated at 15 minutes and reaching a nadir between 20 and 25 minutes. Contraction normalized within an hour. One defining characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the apical and midventricular localization of dysfunction, and this was clearly reproduced in the present model (Figure 1) and was confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (online-only Data Supplement III and Movie I).
Apical Hypokinesia Is Epinephrine Specific We and others have previously reported that epinephrine or isoproterenol at high concentrations can switch the ␤2AR from positively inotropic Gs to negatively inotropic Gi coupling,17,22,33 whereas norepinephrine cannot.16 We found that equivalent high-dose intravenous norepinephrine did not generate the negative effect observed after epinephrine bolus (Figures 1A through 1C), and concentration-response curves (online-only Data Supplement Figure I) confirmed that no concentration of norepinephrine was negatively inotropic. Changes in heart rate and systemic arterial blood pressure did not differ between epinephrine and norepinephrine, which indicates appropriate matching of effective concentrations (online-only Data Supple-

ment Figure II). Lack of negative effect of norepinephrine additionally eliminates either myocardial ␤1AR- or ␣1ARmediated vasoconstriction as the principal mediator of the epinephrine-stimulated negative inotropic effect.
Epinephrine-Induced Apical Hypokinesia Is Gi Dependent We used PTX to inhibit Gi by in vivo pretreatment of the rats 3 days before the intravenous epinephrine challenge. In vitro challenge of isolated cardiomyocytes from these hearts with carbachol (after ␤AR stimulation) was used to verify inhibition of Gi effects (not shown). The negative effect of epinephrine was completely abolished by PTX (Figures 2A through 2C), which provides strong evidence for a Gidependent mechanism of action. Apical and midventricular regions switched completely to give an increase in contraction, and even basal hypercontractility was significantly enhanced. PTX pretreatment did not alter baseline function, the systemic arterial pressure response to epinephrine (onlineonly Data Supplement Figure III), or time-matched responses after control saline bolus (online-only Data Supplement Figures

IV and V). PTX pretreatment reduced the vagally mediated reflex bradycardia during the first minutes after epinephrine injection (online-only Data Supplement Figure IIE). However, systemic vagal blockade with atropine pretreatment failed to prevent epinephrine-induced hypokinesia as observed with PTX pretreatment and significantly increased mortality caused by cardiogenic shock (online-only Data Supplement Figure VI). This excluded systemic vagal inhibition as the explanation for the PTX-mediated prevention of apical hypokinesia.
We also developed an in vitro model in which isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were treated for 20 minutes with epinephrine. These cells showed a decreased positive inotropic response to a subsequent ␤2AR challenge (Figure 3A; online-only Data Supplement VII). Maximum responses to high calcium were unchanged, which indicates that overall cellular and contractile function was not compromised (online-only Data Supplement Figure VIII). The depression of ␤2AR response after epinephrine pretreatment observed in this in vitro model was completely prevented (and the

response became higher than control) after PTX treatment (Figure 3A; online-only Data Supplement VII). Notably, measurement of cAMP under the same conditions showed much less marked changes: PTX treatment increased contraction 11-fold without a significant increase in cAMP levels (Figure 3B). This implies a parallel negative inotropic pathway activated through Gi. Because p38 MAPK has been shown to be both Gi-dependent and negatively inotropic in rat ventricular myocytes, we compared treatment with PTX and a p38 MAPK inhibitor (Figure 3C). Both were able to increase ␤2AR responses to a similar degree, and the effects of the 2 were not additive.
Apical Ventricular Cardiomyocytes Have Higher ␤2AR Density and ␤2AR-Mediated Contractile Responses Than Basal Cardiomyocytes We have hypothesized that the increased apical sensitivity observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients and our model is caused by a greater proportion of ␤2ARs relative to ␤1ARs in the apex,8 because the greater concentration of sympathetic innervation in the base of the heart13 is counterbalanced by increased apical ␤AR functional responses to circulating catecholamines.9–12 Using a radioligand bindingdisplacement assay to directly quantify the ␤2 to ␤1AR ratio, we found that apical cardiomyocytes demonstrated an increased ␤2 to ␤1AR ratio (Figure 3D). The functional consequences of a higher ␤2 to ␤1AR ratio were studied and confirmed greater ␤2AR-specific contractile responses in apical ventricular cardio-

myocytes than in paired basal cardiomyocytes isolated from the same heart (Figure 3E). ␤2AR-dependent and maximal cAMP responses demonstrated no difference between apical and basal
cardiomyocytes (online-only Data Supplement Figure IX) and
therefore could not explain the observed gradient and contractile
response.
Epinephrine-Induced ␤2AR-Gi Signaling Is Cardioprotective
Because ␤2AR-Gi is widely reported to be antiapoptotic and cardioprotective,34–36 we hypothesized that blocking ␤2AR-Gi signaling might increase the cardiotoxic effects of high epinephrine levels via uninhibited ␤1AR-Gs and ␤2AR-Gs signaling. In the rat Takotsubo model in vivo, epinephrine-induced mortality was increased significantly by prior selective ␤2AR blockade with ICI-118,551 (at concentrations insufficient to activate Gi) or p38 MAPK inhibition with SB203580 (Figure 4A). Death often occurred within 5 to
10 minutes and was caused by cardiogenic shock and hypo-
kinesia rather than primary ventricular fibrillation. In vitro,
isoproterenol increased cell death in cultured myocytes, an effect largely inhibited by ␤1AR blockade (Figure 4B), whereas overexpression of ␤2AR (Figure 4B) or Gi (Figure 4C) protected against catecholamine-induced cell death. ␤2AR switching from Gs to Gi coupling is thought to be enhanced after strong ␤AR-Gs activation, mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).18 Overexpression of a ␤2AR construct in which PKA sites had been mutated to prevent phosphorylation not only

failed to protect but produced ␤1AR-independent cell death (Figure 4B). This mutant was also unable to support ␤2ARdependent negative inotropism, in contrast to wild-type ␤2AR (online-only Data Supplement Figure X).
␤-Blockers That Activate ␤2AR-Gi Do Not Rescue and May Worsen Established Apical Hypokinesia
In the previous section, we noted that pretreatment with a specific ␤2AR blocker before the epinephrine bolus did not appear to be a therapeutically useful maneuver. We also predicted that clinically used ␤-blockers that activate ␤2AR-Gi might exacerbate the epinephrine-induced negative inotropic effect. The Gi-dependent negative effect of ␤-blockers is most readily seen in myocytes from failing human hearts (in
which Gi is increased29); we selected compounds that had either

strong (propranolol) or modest (carvedilol) effects on these cells (Figure 5A). Figures 5B and 5C show the effect of the 2 blockers added 15 minutes after epinephrine in the in vivo model, when peak negative responses were developing. Propranolol, with higher ␤2AR-Gi agonism, significantly enhanced and prolonged the negative effects of epinephrine at both apex and base (Figure 5B), whereas carvedilol, with less pronounced ␤2AR-Gi agonism, had little effect on the apex but converted the base from positive to significant negative responses (Figure 5C). In contrast, the ␤1AR-selective blocker bisoprolol reduced the positive effect of epinephrine at the base but did not convert it to a significant negative response; there was no effect on the apical epinephrine response (online-only Data Supplement Figure XI). These data support our hypothesis of synergistic effects of epinephrine with propranolol (and to a minor extent carvedilol) on ␤2AR-Gi signaling. Although the negative inotropic of epinephrine was enhanced, there was no increase in mortality with the addition of propranolol or carvedilol (Figure 4A).
Levosimendan Reverses Epinephrine-Induced Apical Dysfunction Without Increased Mortality Levosimendan was selected for comparison because it is an inotrope with a cAMP-independent mechanism of action, which increases myofilament calcium sensitivity.37 Global cardiac contraction in untreated hearts was increased with infusion of this compound (data not shown). In contrast to other agents, application of levosimendan at the point at which epinephrine negative effects were beginning was effective in preventing further decline in cardiac function (Figure 6). This contractile benefit and rescue occurred with no deaths in the epinephrine-treated group (Figure 4A).
Discussion
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute cardiac syndrome in the modern era of early access to diagnostic coronary angiography.1–3 As a cardiac response to extreme stress levels, it carries a relatively good prognosis but has the intriguing feature of regional (apical) hypokinesia, which is counterintuitive in relation to the systemic nature of the trigger and the evolutionary drive for increased cardiac output during “flight-or-fight” responses. We have developed a rat model that mimics the clinical features, with acute, reversible apical and midventricular myocardial hypokinesia but preserved or enhanced basal contractility (Figure 1). A rapid high-dose intravenous epinephrine bolus, designed to mimic the serum catecholamine response to acute stress compared with the traditional infusion protocols, recapitulated the classic clinical findings, whereas the equivalent norepinephrine bolus did not (Figure 1). This implied the mechanism is epinephrine specific and confirms the observation that dysfunction is not typically observed in the region with the highest density of norepinephrinereleasing sympathetic nerve terminals.13
We further investigated this concept of apical-basal gradients of catecholamine responsiveness to ␤AR subtype and demonstrated that apical ventricular cardiomyocytes have a higher ␤2AR density and a greater ␤2AR-induced sensitivity than basal cardiomyocytes isolated from the same heart (Figures 3D and 3E). The inability of norepinephrine at equivalent (and higher) doses to initiate acute apical dysfunc-

tion excludes coronary vasospasm or ␤1AR-mediated signaling as a primary effector (Figure 1). This is in agreement with clinical observations that the apical dysfunction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy extends beyond the territory of a single coronary bed.1–3,8 Also supporting the predominance of a cardiomyocyte-based explanation rather than a vascular one is the ability of the present in vitro cardiomyocyte model to reproduce a number of the key in vivo observations (Figure 3), as well as the matched responses of heart rate and blood pressure between the epinephrine and norepinephrine cohorts.
Norepinephrine also differs in that it does not couple ␤1ARs or ␤2ARs to Gi signaling, whereas epinephrine at high concentrations produces a ␤2AR Gs-to-Gi switch. ␤2AR-Gi coupling has been reported in a number of experimental models, including ␤2AR and Gi overexpression, and importantly in chronic heart failure, in which Gi levels are increased.29 ␤2AR-Gi coupling occurs via a process termed stimulus/ligand-directed trafficking or biased agonism. Other agonists, such as high-dose isoproterenol, also produce this switch, and we note a study in which isoproterenol infusion over 2 weeks also produced a specific apical contraction defect.9 The key role of Gi in the cardiodepression was shown by the ability of PTX to convert apical responses to epinephrine from negative to positive (Figure 2). The response of basal myocardium was also increased, which implies that ␤2AR-Gi was operational even in this region despite the ␤1AR predominance. Nonclassic examples of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy have been observed in which the base or mid

left ventricle is affected,38 and this may reflect individual patterns of ␤2AR expression. The in vivo observations were supported by those in isolated cells. In untreated apical myocytes, positive inotropic responses to ␤2AR stimulation were enhanced by PTX (Figure 3C; online-only Data Sup-
plement Figure VII; and as reported previously39). In myo-
cytes pretreated with epinephrine, PTX was able to rescue and further enhance the depressed ␤2AR-mediated positive responses (Figure 3A; online-only Data Supplement Figure
VII). cAMP responses were decreased modestly in pretreated
myocytes (Figure 3B), although they were less affected than
contractile responses. However, PTX was able to rescue
contractile responses with no significant effect on cAMP
(Figure 3B), which implies the existence of a separate,
negatively inotropic Gi-dependent pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK produced similar and nonadditive effects to PTX,
consistent with the suggested role for this pathway as a
Gi-dependent, negatively inotropic modulator. The epinephrine-dependent ␤2AR-Gi–mediated negative
inotropism requires a preceding high ␤1AR-Gs activation to initiate cAMP-dependent PKA and GRK phosphorylation of the ␤2AR.18,40 This implies that although norepinephrine does not directly couple receptors to Gi, the rise in cAMP it produces will predispose the ␤2AR to traffic to Gi on subsequent epinephrine binding. Here, we demonstrate that PKA-mediated ␤2AR phosphorylation is critical for Gi coupling, because deleting the phosphorylation sites prevented
both negative inotropism and cardioprotection attributable to

␤2AR-Gi coupling (Figure 4B; online-only Data Supplement Figure X). This also explains the reversibility of the Takot-
subo cardiomyopathy syndrome. As the serum epinephrine levels fall, ␤2AR dephosphorylation, or internalization and replacement with de novo unphosphorylated ␤2ARs, reduces the ␤2AR-Gi stimulus trafficking and restores normal contractile function in the surviving cardiomyocytes. Studies in
model cell systems overexpressing fluorescently labeled ␤2AR have demonstrated the dependence of both PKA- and GRK-mediated ␤2AR phosphorylation for ␤2AR internalization from the surface membrane and recycling to different
surface microdomains.19 Interestingly, they have also demon-
strated the epinephrine-specific dependence of this traffick-
ing.40 This is relevant to patients with Takotsubo cardiomy-
opathy, because to date, there has been a failure to identify any associated polymorphisms in the ␣1ARs, ␤1AR, or ␤2ARs,41 but one study, albeit with small patient numbers, found an increased
prevalence of the GRK polymorphism L41Q in the Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy patient cohort compared with healthy matched
control subjects.20 This gain-of-function mutation, previously referred to as genetic ␤-blockade,42 confers reduced responsive-

ness to ␤AR agonists and improves prognosis in the population carrying this polymorphism,42 both conceivably consistent with enhanced myocardial ␤2AR-Gi coupling.
Although the final outcome for the patient with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally good, they have been through an acute cardiac event that requires hospitalization, and there is a significant incidence of cardiogenic shock (Ϸ4%), malignant ventricular arrhythmias (1%–2%), and death (1%– 1.5%). It therefore seemed reasonable to try to block the depression of contraction with either a specific ␤2AR antagonist or a p38 MAPK inhibitor; however, the marked increase in mortality produced by this maneuver gave a clear indication that this was a counterproductive strategy (Figure 4A). The rapidity of death, usually within 5 to 10 minutes and always within 45 minutes, made it unlikely that apoptosis was the underlying mechanism. ␤2AR or Gi has been implicated in suppression of arrhythmias,43 and ␤2AR variants have been implicated in sudden cardiac death.44 ␤2AR knockout mice went into cardiogenic shock after doxorubicin administration, through a ␤1AR-related mechanism,45 and ␤2AR/Gi mechanisms have been implicated in postischemic stunning.46 All of these are potential mechanisms that could underlie acute mortality. We suggest that the enhanced ␤2AR-Gi coupling initiated by high epinephrine levels is protective because it dampens the effects of toxic ␤AR-Gs coupling, which would be fatal if left unchecked.
Few ␤-blockers are pure neutral antagonists, with most having some other effect, such as partial agonism (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), inverse agonism (reduction in activity of constitutively active receptors), or biased agonism (ligand-directed trafficking to other pathways). It has been amply demonstrated that ␤2AR blockers can activate other signaling pathways, both G-protein and non–G-protein dependent.47 We were first alerted to the possibility that the cardiodepressant effects in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy were ␤2AR-Gi dependent by their similarity to the ␤2AR-Gi– mediated effect of ␤-blockers on myocytes from failing human heart.29 We therefore hypothesized that ␤-blockers with strong ␤2AR-Gi agonism would synergize with the negative inotropic effect of epinephrine. Propranolol, a particularly cardiodepressant agent, markedly enhanced and prolonged the negative phase when given after the epinephrine bolus in the present in vivo model (Figure 5B). In support of the hypothesis of additive negative inotropic effects of propranolol and epinephrine, we note a recent report that an acute dilated cardiomyopathy was precipitated in a patient with pheochromocytoma after taking propranolol for migraine.48 Carvedilol had a more modest effect, reversing basal hypercontractility while having a neutral effect on apical hypokinesia (Figure 5C). Carvedilol and propranolol are also able to produce biased agonism through G␤␥ mechanisms,49 which would be PTX sensitive. Although possibly exacerbating the syndrome, carvedilol could be useful in the treatment of the minority of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients with severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction secondary to basal hypercontractility. Neither blocker had a deleterious effect on mortality in the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy model. Bisoprolol, which is predominantly ␤1AR selective, did not reproduce these effects to synergize with epinephrine.

We considered the implications for treating Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and for heart failure therapy more generally. For the patient with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, strategies to raise cAMP (catecholaminergic inotropes or phosphodiesterase inhibitors) would clearly be contraindicated. Indeed, dobutamine administered for stress echocardiography testing has precipitated Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.7 A cAMPindependent inotrope, levosimendan, was effective in reversing the negative inotropic effect of epinephrine, and rescue occurred without increased (and a trend to decreased) mortality (Figures 4A and 6). We suggest that this is likely to be a safe supporting and bridging strategy for the sickest patients with cardiogenic shock until spontaneous recovery occurs, and preliminary clinical reports support this view.50,51 At the higher doses, levosimendan can inhibit phosphodiesterases37 and increase cAMP, and thus, we only would recommend the lower (nonvasodilatory) doses. The value of nonselective ␤-blockers, which may also act as agonists at ␤2AR-Gi, is more difficult to predict, because they may amplify both the negative inotropic and the protective effects of epinephrine. It could further be suggested that the beneficial effects of ␤-blockers in heart failure has taken serendipitous advantage of cardioprotective ␤2AR-Gi biased agonism. If those 2 effects could be modulated separately, this might point the way for an improved design of future ␤-blockers by their selection for cardioprotection through ␤2AR-Gi biased agonism.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome characterized by severe acute (but reversible)
apical ventricular dysfunction, ST elevation, and unobstructed coronary arteries. Physical or emotional stress is a frequent
precipitant, as well as iatrogenic catecholamine exposure. We generated a model of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy using a
single high bolus dose of epinephrine in anesthetized rats, which reproduced the reversible apical hypocontractility. We explored the subcellular mechanisms and identified that high-dose epinephrine activated a switch of ␤2-adrenergic receptor (␤2AR) coupling from the positively inotropic Gs-cAMP to a negatively inotropic Gi signaling pathway. Norepinephrine, which does not activate this Gs/Gi switch, did not precipitate apical dysfunction. Proportionately higher ␤2AR numbers at the apex produced the apical-basal gradient in contractility. Prevention of the switch increased sudden death in this model, which is consistent with the protective antiarrhythmic and antiapoptotic nature of Gi signaling. We screened various ␤-blockers (given after apical dysfunction was established) using the model and noted that propranolol, which also switches ␤2AR to the Gi pathway, exacerbated contractile dysfunction without increasing mortality. Carvedilol had similar but less pronounced effects, and bisoprolol did not affect the response. Avoiding the ␤AR-cAMP axis with the calcium myofilament sensitizer levosimendan,
we were able to completely rescue the acute Takotsubo syndrome, with 100% survival. This model suggests that an epinephrine-induced ␤2AR Gs/Gi switch is responsible for the acute apical dysfunction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy but that it may also confer an element of protection against damage by high catecholamines.
