Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the risk of ischemic stroke in patients who have atrial ﬁbrillation and patients who have atrial ﬂutter. Methods: Using inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data from 2008 to 2014 for a 5% sample of all beneﬁciaries 66 years of age or older, we identiﬁed patients diagnosed with atrial ﬁbrillation and those diagnosed with atrial ﬂutter. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke. In the primary analysis, patients with atrial ﬂutter were censored upon converting to ﬁbrillation; in a secondary analysis, they were not. Survival statistics were used to compare incidence of stroke in patients with ﬂutter and patients with ﬁbrillation. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the associations of ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation with ischemic stroke after adjustment for demographics and risk factors. Results: We identiﬁed 14,953 patients with ﬂutter and 318,138 with ﬁbrillation. During a mean follow-up period of 2.8 (±2.3) years, we identiﬁed 18,900 ischemic strokes. The annual incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with ﬂutter was 1.38% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.22%-1.57%) compared with 2.02% (95% CI 1.99%-2.05%) in patients with ﬁbrillation. After adjustment for demographics and stroke risk factors, ﬂutter was associated with a lower risk of stroke compared with ﬁbrillation (hazard ratio .69; 95% CI .60-.79, P < .05). Within 1 year, 65.7% (95% CI 64.9%-66.4%) of patients with ﬂutter converted to ﬁbrillation but remained at a lower risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio .85; 95% CI .78-.92). Conclusions: Patients with atrial ﬂutter faced a lower risk of ischemic stroke than patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. Key Words: Stroke—atrial ﬂutter—atrial ﬁbrillation—arrhythmia.

Atrial dysrhythmias are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Atrial ﬁbrillation is a common cause of ischemic stroke and is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke.1-3 Patients with atrial ﬁbrillation face a heightened stroke risk, and half of all ischemic strokes in high-income countries are attributed to atrial ﬁbrillation.4 A related and less prevalent atrial dysrhythmia, atrial ﬂutter, is also associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke.5,6 The magnitude of stroke risk in patients with atrial ﬂutter as compared with ﬁbrillation remains unclear.
Stroke prevention guidelines recommend anticoagulation for patients with either atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter.7,8 Previous studies have shown an increased risk of stroke in patients with atrial ﬂutter as compared with the general population.3,4 However, a head-to-head comparison of stroke

risk in patients with ﬁbrillation and patients with ﬂutter has not been performed. Given the uncertainty and potential clinical implications, we used inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data to compare the rate of stroke in patients with atrial ﬂutter and patients with atrial ﬁbrillation.
Methods
Design
We performed a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data from 2008 to 2014 on a 5% sample of Medicare beneﬁciaries. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid provides these deidentiﬁed data for research purposes.9 In the dataset, beneﬁciaries are given an anonymous identiﬁcation number that allows for longitudinal tracking across all care settings while enrolled in Medicare. Administrative claims data such as these are useful for population-based epidemiological studies of stroke risk factors, especially risk factors that are relatively rare within the population, such as atrial ﬂutter.10,11 The Weill Cornell Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved our analysis.
Patient Population
We limited our cohort to patients 66 years of age or older to allow 1 year for patients to enter care as Medicare beneﬁciaries and for providers to document preexisting comorbidities. We only included beneﬁciaries with continuous coverage in traditional fee-for-service Medicare (both Parts A and B) for at least 1 year (or until death, if applicable).12 Our sample included patients with a diagnosis of either atrial ﬁbrillation or atrial ﬂutter. Atrial ﬂutter was deﬁned by the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-9-CM) code 427.32, and atrial ﬁbrillation was deﬁned by ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 427.31. These ICD-9-CM codes have been previously validated to have a positive predictive value ranging from 70% to 96% when compared to expert medical record review for the ascertainment of atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter.13 Patients with a documented stroke before or at the same time as their ﬁrst diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter were excluded. In a sensitivity analysis, we limited our cohort to patients with atrial ﬁbrillation and atrial ﬂutter diagnosed speciﬁcally by a cardiologist.
Measurements
Our primary outcome of interest was ischemic stroke, identiﬁed using a previously validated ICD-9-CM diagnosis code algorithm with a sensitivity of 86%, speciﬁcity of 95%, and positive predictive value of 90%.14 A diagnosis of ischemic stroke under this algorithm required an inpatient claim for ICD-9-CM codes 433.x1, 434, or 436 in any hospital discharge diagnosis position in the absence

of a concomitant code for rehabilitation (V57) or traumatic brain injury (800 to 804, 850 to 854).14
Additional covariates included were demographics and traditional vascular risk factors. Patients’ age, sex, and self-reported race were all determined from the Medicare denominator ﬁle. We used ICD-9-CM codes from all visits preceding the index diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter to ascertain the following vascular risk factors: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, alcohol abuse, and tobacco use.15 We used comorbidity data to calculate patients’ CHA2DS2VASc scores and Charlson comorbidities.16,17 The Charlson Comorbidity Index reﬂects a comprehensive set of baseline comorbidities and predicts overall mortality.17 Additionally, ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify patients with prior bleeding.18 To account for possible differences in anticoagulation use, we performed separate analyses in which we additionally adjusted our models for the remaining comorbidities in the Charlson Comorbidity Index and prior bleeding as these factors may inﬂuence physicians’ decisions regarding anticoagulation.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared using the χ2 test and the t test, when appropriate. We used descriptive statistics with binomial exact conﬁdence intervals (CIs) to calculate crude rates of ischemic stroke. Survival statistics were used to determine the annual incidence of ischemic stroke and Kaplan−Meier curves were used to present cumulative rates. Because we were interested in understanding the risk of stroke while patients have atrial ﬂutter and not atrial ﬁbrillation, we censored patients with atrial ﬂutter upon diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation. However, because ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation frequently co-occur,19 we performed a secondary analysis in which we did not censor patients with ﬂutter upon diagnosis of ﬁbrillation. This “intention-to-treat” analysis took into account the fact that the natural history of ﬂutter often involves the development of ﬁbrillation.
We also tested the hypothesis that the CHA2DS2VASc score would be associated with the time to conversion from ﬂutter to ﬁbrillation. In a post hoc analysis, we modeled the CHA2DS2-VASc scores as a step function instead of a linear function. In all analyses, patients were censored at the time of ﬁrst ischemic stroke, death, termination of Medicare coverage, or December 31, 2015. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare the risk of stroke between ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation while adjusting for demographics and stroke risk factors. In an alternative model, we simply adjusted for CHA2DS2VASc scores. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP (Version 14, StataCorp LLC, College Station,

Results
Patient Characteristics
We identiﬁed 14,953 patients with atrial ﬂutter and 318,138 with atrial ﬁbrillation. The mean age of patients with ﬂutter was 76.9 years (±7.7 years) and that of patients with ﬁbrillation was 78.4 years (±8.0 years). Patients with ﬂutter were less often female (39.8% versus 51.8%); were less likely to suffer from hypertension, diabetes, and congestive heart failure; and had lower mean CHA2DS2VASc scores (3.0 ± 1.2 versus 3.3 ± 1.3). The prevalence of other vascular risk factors was similar between patients with ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation (Table 1).
During a mean follow-up period of 2.8 (±2.3) years, 18,900 patients were hospitalized for ischemic stroke. Ischemic strokes occurred in 236 patients with atrial ﬂutter and in 18,664 patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. In the primary analysis, in which patients with ﬂutter were censored upon the diagnosis of ﬁbrillation, the annual incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with ﬂutter was 1.38% (95% CI 1.22%-1.57%) versus 2.02% (95% CI 1.99%-2.05%) in patients with ﬁbrillation (Fig 1). After adjustment for demographics and vascular risk factors, atrial ﬂutter was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke than ﬁbrillation (hazard ratio [HR] .69; 95% CI .61-.79) (Table 2). In a sensitivity analysis limited to cases of atrial ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation diagnosed by cardiologists only, ﬂutter

was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of stroke than ﬁbrillation, although this association was somewhat attenuated (HR .84; 95% CI .75-.94). In an alternative model adjusted for the CHA2DS2-VASc score, atrial ﬂutter was similarly associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke (HR .69; 95% CI .60-.78). Our results were unchanged when we adjusted for the remaining comorbidities in the Charlson Comorbidity Index and bleeding history (Table 2).
By 1 year after their initial diagnosis of atrial ﬂutter, 65.67% (95% CI 64.91%-66.43%) had received a diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation. We found a signiﬁcant but weak association between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and the time from ﬂutter diagnosis until conversion to ﬁbrillation (HR per 1-point increase, 1.02; 95% CI 1.005-1.03). In a post hoc analysis in which we modeled the CHA2DS2-VASc scores as a step function instead of a linear function, it appeared that there was an increased risk of conversion from ﬂutter to ﬁbrillation in those with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 5 or higher compared with those with scores lower than 5 (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05-1.15).
In a secondary analysis in which patients with atrial ﬂutter were not censored upon diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation, the annual incidence of stroke in patients with ﬂutter was 1.57% (95% CI 1.46%-1.70%) compared with the 2.02% (95% CI 1.99%-2.05%) incidence in atrial ﬁbrillation. In this analysis, atrial ﬂutter remained associated with a lower adjusted risk of stroke, although the difference was attenuated (HR .84; 95% CI .41-.92) (Table 2).

Discussion
In a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneﬁciaries, we found a lower risk of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial ﬂutter as compared with patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. The risk of risk associated with ﬂutter remained signiﬁcantly lower regardless of whether we censored patients at the time of ﬁbrillation and in analyses limited to diagnoses made by cardiologists only.

There are few comparative data on the risks of ischemic stroke in atrial ﬂutter versus atrial ﬁbrillation. In a large observational study by Biblo et al, the risk of stroke in patients with atrial ﬂutter appeared lower than the risk in patients with ﬁbrillation, but the 2 conditions were not directly compared, and the study was limited by its exclusive use of inpatient claims data, which likely captured nongeneralizable cases of ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation.20 Other studies have reported that atrial ﬂutter is associated with an increased risk of stroke and that this risk may be equivalent to the stroke risk in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation, but these studies included relatively few cases of atrial ﬂutter and thus may have lacked sufficient power to conclusively compare stroke risk in these closely related dysrhythmias.21-24 In contrast to the prevailing clinical understanding, our results suggest that the risk of stroke associated with atrial ﬂutter is not equivalent to the risk associated with atrial ﬁbrillation.
Our ﬁndings are in parallel with studies of the burden of atrial ﬁbrillation and stroke risk. Although it was long taught that the risk of stroke was similar regardless of the burden of atrial ﬁbrillation, recent studies have indicated that the risk of stroke is higher in permanent rather than paroxysmal atrial ﬁbrillation.25 In this context, our study adds further evidence that speciﬁc features of atrial dysrhythmias may reﬂect different degrees of associated stroke risk. From a mechanistic point of view, it remains unclear to what degree atrial ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation cause varying rates of thromboembolism and to what degree these different dysrhythmias reﬂect varying degrees of severity of atrial cardiomyopathy, which in turn causes thromboembolism.26,27
Regardless of any differences in pathophysiology and thromboembolic risk between these 2 conditions, we found that most patients with atrial ﬂutter were soon diagnosed with atrial ﬁbrillation, which is consistent with

previous reports.22,24 When accounting for this high rate of conversion, we found that the risk of stroke in ﬂutter became more similar, although still not equivalent, to stroke risk in ﬁbrillation. In the absence of clear predictors of conversion from ﬂutter to ﬁbrillation, our ﬁndings generally support current guidelines that recommend anticoagulation for patients with atrial ﬂutter if it is accompanied by other stroke risk factors.7,8 If the temporal evolution of these dysrhythmias could be robustly predicted, then more personalized use of anticoagulation may be possible. Our results indicate that the CHA2DS2VASc score is not strongly associated with this temporal evolution from ﬂutter to ﬁbrillation.
Our results should be considered in light of multiple limitations. First, our reliance on administrative claims data may have led to misclassiﬁcation of both predictors and outcomes. To minimize such misclassiﬁcation, we used outcome codes that have been previously validated.13,14 Whereas diagnosis codes 427.3x allow reliable ascertainment of atrial ﬁbrillation and/or ﬂutter as an overall group of related dysrhythmias,13 the speciﬁcity of codes 427.31 and 427.32 for the individual conditions is uncertain. Bias may be possible if clinicians systematically classiﬁed ambiguous dysrhythmias in lower risk patients as atrial ﬂutter and those in higher risk patients as atrial ﬁbrillation, but this seems unlikely given the prevailing clinical teaching that these 2 conditions have similar stroke risk. Furthermore, we found a lower risk of stroke in ﬂutter versus ﬁbrillation even in sensitivity analyses that required diagnosis of atrial ﬁbrillation or atrial ﬂutter speciﬁcally by a cardiologist, which would be expected to increase the accuracy of these diagnoses. Second, we lacked data on anticoagulant medication use, but it is unlikely that our results were explained by a higher rate of anticoagulant therapy in atrial ﬂutter versus ﬁbrillation given current guidelines and the prevailing understanding of stroke risk in these 2 conditions.7,8 Third, the patients in our cohort were at least 66 years old, so our ﬁndings may not be generalized to younger patients.
Conclusions
Among a nationally representative cohort of elderly Americans, patients with atrial ﬂutter faced a lower risk of ischemic stroke than patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. Strategies to identify patients with isolated atrial ﬂutter may allow for more personalized anticoagulation recommendations, although it must be kept in mind that most cases of atrial ﬂutter soon evolve into atrial ﬁbrillation.
