Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, devastating syndrome that affects both upper and lower motoneurons and results in limb and facial motor weakness, atrophy, spasticity, and death ( 1 , 2 , 3 ). The age-adjusted worldwide incidence of ALS is 0.5–3 per 100,000 person years (without obvious race-related differences). Older males and postmenopausal females are most typically affected ( 3 , 5 ). Familial ALS (fALS) accounts for less than 10% of diagnosed cases ( 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 ), with sporadic ALS (sALS) comprising the remainder of diagnoses. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unknown, notable progress has been made in identifying molecular processes potentially involved in ALS-mediated motoneuron injury. This chapter reviews some of these recent advances in our understanding of the molecular bases of sALS and fALS.

A significant discovery in ALS research was the identification of a genetic defect associated with 10–15% of fALS kindreds ( 7 ). The involved gene, SOD1 , encodes a cytosolic form of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and identified mutations in exons 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the SOD1 gene all appear to reduce Cu 2+ /Zn 2+ SOD stability and SOD-catalyzed free-radical metabolism ( 8 , 9 ). 
 
Differences in the location of these missense mutations apparently affect both clinical fALS severity and measured SOD activity levels. For example, a very slowly progressive form of fALS in two Japanese kindreds is associated with a His 46 → Arg point mutation on the SOD molecule. This mutation may alter Cu 2+ binding to the enzyme's catalytic site and reduces erythrocyte lysate SOD activity by approximately 20% ( 10 ). In Caucasian fALS kindreds with rapid rates of clinical disease progression, many SOD1 mutations instead code for the dimer contact region and appear to destabilize SOD dimer formation. Two such point mutations (Ala 4 → Val and Gly 41 → Ser) produce an enzyme with less than 50% of normal Cu 2+ /Zn 2+ SOD activity ( 11 ), and death of affected patients occurs after less than one year of symptom onset ( 11 , 12 ). 
 
To understand ALS pathogenesis, one must understand how altering SOD activity can induce cell injury. SOD protects against direct superoxide anion (O 2 •− )-induced cell damage by reducing [O 2 •− ] i ; hence, reduced Cu 2+ /Zn 2+ SOD activity in patients with fALS equates to increased steady-state levels of [O 2 •− ] i ( 13 ). However, O 2 •− is also readily converted to other, more toxic radicals. For example, O 2 •− can be converted to the highly destructive hydroxyl radical (OH•) in the presence of elemental iron. Moreover, it interacts with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO − ) ( 14 ), which can disrupt lipid bilayers and oxidize protein methionine residues and thiols ( 15 ). Peroxynitrites also react with SOD to form nitronium-like molecules, which modify tyrosine residues ( 16 ). Peroxynitrites are also protonated to form nitrosyl radicals, which decompose to OH• ( 17 ). 
 
To attempt to recreate SOD-associated fALS in vitro, some researchers have directly blocked cellular SOD activity in culture systems. Inhibition of Cu 2+ /Zn 2+ SOD in cultured rat spinal cord slices with SOD1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides leads to apoptotic degeneration of most spinal neurons (including motoneurons) within several weeks ( 18 ). However, SOD may be essential to aerobic life ( 19 ), and significant enzyme inhibition may likewise be injurious to all cells. 
 
A more specific approach has been to test the phenotypic and biochemical consequences of SOD1 gene insertion into transgenic mice. Overexpression of normal SOD1 resulted in increased lipid peroxidation ( 20 ) and distal tongue and hindlimb motor deficits ( 21 ) in such mice, but these changes may have been caused by overproduction of H 2 O 2 by SOD, with a subsequent paradoxical increase in [OH•] synthesis. Expression in transgenic mice of human fALS SOD1 (containing Gly 93 → Ala or Ala 4 → Val missense mutations) produced more obvious paralytic disease in these animals, who developed asymmetric weakness by three to four months of age and died within six months ( 22 ). Pathologically, selective lower motoneuron loss and sprouting of remaining neurons were observed in these animals, without upper motoneuron deficits. However, without endogenous mouse SOD1 gene knockout prior to transfection with mutant human SOD1 , SOD activity levels measured in transfected mice were again 50–400% higher than those observed in nontransfected control mice. Thus, gain-of-function SOD1 mutations indicate that increased SOD activity in the presence of mutant enzyme is associated with rapidly progressive lower motoneuron disease, but they do not yet show whether reduced SOD activity by mutant SOD1 causes a similar process or, consequently, how this mouse transgenic model relates to human fALS SOD defects. 
 
Because the clinical syndromes of fALS and sALS are quite similar, it has been suggested that the mechanisms of cell injury are similar as well. However, although reduced Cu 2+ /Zn 2+ SOD activity was observed in fALS patients with mutant SOD1 , no SOD activity changes occurred in other ALS patients ( 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 ). Subtle forms of oxidative damage have nevertheless been observed in postmortem tissues from sALS patients ( 24 , 25 , 27 , 28 ). This finding implies that radical-mediated cellular injury may also occur in sALS pathogenesis and contribute to a final common pathway of motoneuron loss.

The theory that sALS is caused by glutamate-induced excitotoxic injury was derived from two sets of observations. First, epidemiologic studies of Western Pacific ALS (ALS-Parkinsonism-dementia complex) implicated a toxin possibly derived from cycad seed flour ( 29 ). One of these toxins, β- N -methylamino- l -alanine (BMAA), has a structure similar to that of glutamate ( 30 ) and has neurotoxic effects similar to those of β-oxalylamino- l -alanine (BOAA, the cause of lathyrism) when added to CNS explant cultures ( 31 , 32 ). However, reports that l -BMAA induced an ALS-like illness in monkeys ( 33 ) remain unconfirmed ( 34 ), and l -BMAA levels present in washed cycad flour ingested by Chamorro Indians appear to be much lower ( 35 ) than those needed to produce other toxic effects in animal models ( 36 ) or in vitro. Furthermore, the incubation period of Western Pacific ALS is not consistent with the known effects of l -BMAA ( 37 ). 
 
Second, tissue glutamate levels ( 38 , 39 ) and glutamate transport activity ( 40 ) are reduced in spinal cords in patients with sALS. Because glutamate and glutamate receptor agonists induce neuronal death in vitro and in vivo ( 37 , 41 ), these data have suggested to some researchers that motoneuron death in sALS results from prolonged exposure to elevated glutamate concentrations. Others have countered that these data simply reflect glutamatergic cell loss mediated by other mechanisms ( 42 ), without invoking excitotoxic injury as the primary mechanism responsible for sALS. Certainly, the rapid time course for excitotoxic cell injury is not compatible with slow motoneuron loss in ALS, unless another process chronically triggers glutamate release. 
 
However, although clinical data implicating glutamate in sALS pathogenesis are limited, alterations in glutamate levels result in motoneuron loss in vitro. For example, chronic inhibition of glutamate uptake in organotypic rat spinal cord cultures produced both an increase in extracellular glutamate concentrations and motoneuron degeneration, which was mediated by activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate receptors ( 43 ). Moreover, glutamate may induce cell death in part by increasing O 2 •− concentrations. Following stimulation of N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive glutamate receptors in cerebellar granule cells, O 2 •− -activated death was dependent on calcium (Ca 2+ ) and release of arachidonate and was reduced by trapping O 2 •− ( 44 ). Additionally, apoptotic death of cultured rat spinal neurons induced by SOD inhibition could be greatly potentiated by concomitant block of glutamate transport and reduced by addition of AMPA receptor antagonists ( 18 ). Therefore, glutamate can certainly induce motoneuron death in a process initiated by receptor-operated calcium channel (ROCC) activation.

Until recently, evidence for an autoimmune etiology of sALS was largely clinical. sALS patients have an increased incidence of autoimmune disease ( 2 ), paraproteinemias ( 45 , 46 , 47 ), and serum monoclonal immunoglobulins ( 48 ), although the lack of motoneuron-specific antibodies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy suggests that such changes are a general manifestation of altered immune function. Likewise, increased cellular immunity to poliovirus ( 49 , 50 ), myelin basic protein ( 50 ), and other CNS protein species ( 50 , 51 ) may be a secondary phenomenon ( 52 ). However, the presence of circulating immune complexes and immune complex deposition in kidneys ( 49 , 53 , 54 , 55 ) of sALS patients; the postmortem identification of extracellular immunoglobulin and complement deposition at the neuromuscular junction, motor cortex, and spinal cord ( 56 ); and IgG internalization within motoneurons ( 57 ) of sALS patients all suggest alterations observed in autoimmune disease. 
 
Two distinct guinea pig models and a rabbit model for immune motoneuron disease have been reported. These models indicate the potentiality for selective immune-mediated motoneuron loss in humans (see Figure 1 ). Lower motoneuron disease in guinea pigs was induced by inoculation of purified bovine spinal cord motor neurons ( 58 ), while both upper and lower motoneuron degeneration was caused by inoculation of bovine spinal cord ventral horn homogenates ( 59 ). In contrast, rabbit motoneuron loss was induced by injection of motoneuron hybrid cell homogenates ( 60 ). High serum antibody titers to motoneurons, IgG precipitates at neuromuscular junctions and in motoneurons ( 57 ), and inflammatory cells within the spinal cord ( 61 ) were all documented in guinea pig models. Pathological studies showed motoneuron loss in immunized animals, while electrophysiologic tests documented increased resting acetylcholine (ACh) release from remaining motor nerve terminals. 
 
Figure 1 Proposed mechanisms for motoneuron loss in ALS. (a) Mutant SOD-associated familial ALS. Increaased intracellular O 2 •− results from decreased cytosolic SOD activity, and secondarily induces calcium release from internal stores and cell death. (b) Excitotoxic injury and sporadic ALS. Ostensibly the result of reduced glutamate uptake (GluT), increased levels of extracellular glutamate (Glu) would activate receptor-operated Ca 2+ channels (ROCCs), increase Ca 2+ entry, and secondarily induce oxidative injury and cell death. (c) Autoimmunity in sporadic ALS. Most sALS patients have antibodies directed against voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (VGCCs), which augment Ca 2+ entry into motoneurons and may secondarily activate oxidative injury and cell death. Anti-VGCC antibodies also may increase presynaptic glutamate release onto motoneurons to produce secondary excitotoxic injury. 
 
IgG from sALS patients and guinea pig models also passively transferred physiologic changes to mouse neuromuscular junctions ( 62 ). Increased ACh release was observed from motor nerve terminals of mice injected with guinea pig model IgG or human sALS IgG, but not with control IgG. In such mice, passively transferred IgG histochemically localized to motoneurons and neuromuscular junctions ( 62 ), whereas chronic ALS IgG injections induced axonal degeneration ( 63 ). 
 
Because ACh release at neuromuscular junctions is dependent upon voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation and increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations ( 64 , 65 ), enhanced ACh release might ensue from immune-mediated increases in VGCC currents and presynaptic intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Early electrophysiologic studies tested this hypothesis on L-type VGCCs but demonstrated reduced L-type Ca 2+ currents and charge movement following sALS IgG or F ab fragment addition to L-type VGCCs in myotubes ( 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 ) and VGCCs inserted in lipid bilayers ( 70 ). Recently, however, sALS IgG was shown to increase P-type Ca 2+ currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells ( 71 ) and adrenal cells ( 72 ) and to increase N-type Ca 2+ currents expressed in oocytes ( 73 ). Since P- and N-type VGCCs couple mammalian neuromuscular junction Ca 2+ entry to ACh release, these data may explain increased miniature end plate potential (MEPP) rates observed after sALS IgG transfer. 
 
L-type VGCC antibodies were also biochemically identified by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay in sera from 75% of sALS patients. Antibody titers appeared to correlate with ALS progression rate ( 74 ). In Western immunoblot, sALS IgG reacted only with the ionophore-containing α 1 -subunit of the VGCC ( 76 ). Although patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (another VGCC-directed autoimmune disease) also possessed anti-VGCC antibodies, their antibodies reacted with both VGCC α 1 - and β-subunits in immunoblot. IgG from patients with fALS and other neurologic diseases did not contain immunoreactive antibodies. 
 
To determine whether sALS IgG could augment VGCC-mediated Ca 2+ currents and affect survival in motoneurons, a motoneuron-neuroblastoma hybrid cell line (VSC 4.1) was produced using techniques that had formerly yielded a substantia nigra cell line ( 76 ) and other motoneuron lines ( 60 , 77 ). In physiological experiments using whole cell patch-clamp of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-differentiated VSC 4.1 cells, sALS IgG significantly increased high-threshold VGCC currents ( 78 ). Furthermore, using confocal scanning microscopy and the Ca 2+ -sensitive dye Fluo-3, sALS IgG-mediated Ca 2+ entry into VSC 4.1 cells was found to follow two patterns ( 79 ). A fast transient increase was observed within 15–120 s of IgG addition, and a second, slower progressive increase was found within 4 h of the initial transient in one third of cells. 
 
When sALS IgG was added to cAMP-treated VSC 4.1 cells, significant cell loss was observed after two to three days ( 80 ). This sALS IgG-mediated cytotoxicity can be prevented by 1000-fold reduction of extracellular [Ca 2+ ] with ethylene glycol-bis(β-amino ethyl ether)N,N,N,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), by preincubating immunoglobulins with purified intact L-type VGCC or with VGCC α 1 -subunit (but not with other VGCC subunits), or by preincubating cells with inhibitors of N- and P-type VGCCs (but not with inhibitors of dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type VGCCs). Observed cell death was apoptotic, and DNA fragmentation and laddering were observed within 12 h of sALS IgG addition. Cell blebbing and fragmentation began shortly thereafter ( 81 ). sALS IgG-induced apoptosis can be prevented by previous incubation with the endonuclease inhibitor aurintricarboxylate or with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, but not by inhibitors of glutamate receptors.

Although questions remain as to how such data relate to ALS, these apparently different directions in ALS research converge in several significant areas, thus providing important clues to the mechanisms involved in motoneuron injury and death. First, early changes in Ca 2+ homeostasis are hypothesized to occur in sALS pathogenesis. VGCC activation by sALS IgG reduces motoneuron hybrid survival in vitro, while ROCC activation by glutamate reduces motoneuron survival in vitro. However, although glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity might result from reduced glutamate transport, Ca 2+ entry into presynaptic terminals of glutamatergic neurons contacting motoneurons ( 82 , 83 ) might also be induced by sALS IgG. This entry of Ca 2+ in turn would increase glutamate release, activate motoneuron ROCCs, and add to motoneuron damage caused by VGCC-mediated Ca 2+ entry. Although glutamate receptor antagonists did not block sALS IgG-mediated cytotoxicity in VSC 4.1 cells, VGCC activation has been implicated in the regulation of excitotoxic ligand-gated ion channel function ( 84 ), in intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis, and in neuronal survival ( 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 ). Thus, sALS IgG may trigger motoneuron death both by VGCC activation and by enhancing glutamate release and activating motoneuron excitotoxic ROCCs. This cytotoxicity may be triggered by transient rather than sustained Ca 2+ entry ( 79 , 89 ), suggesting that Ca 2+ acts as a signal initiating a cell death cascade. 
 
Second, at least in vitro, activation of VGCCs by sALS IgG or of ROCCs by glutamate induces a cascade of cellular mechanisms leading to endonuclease activation and apoptotic motoneuron death. Since prolonged Ca 2+ entry occurs prior to DNA fragmentation in both processes, Ca 2+ entry may be an important initiating factor for apoptosis. However, much remains to be determined about the specific steps involved in this process. 
 
Third, this final common pathway may involve free radical-mediated cell injury. Both SOD-associated fALS and in vitro glutamate-induced motoneuron death document increased intracellular levels of O 2 •− resulting from reduced SOD activity. Although not yet tested with sALS IgG in motoneuron hybrids, VGCC activation and increased intracellular Ca 2+ have been shown to increase mitochondrial activity ( 90 ) and oxidative injury ( 91 , 92 ), and Ca 2+ chelators can prevent H 2 O 2 − -induced DNA breakdown and cytotoxicity ( 93 ). Because oxidative stress may also increase release of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores, activate endonucleases, and induce DNA fragmentation ( 94 ), the role of free radicals in apoptosis may likewise be substantial. However, endonuclease activation is not a final step in this process because stimulation of poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] synthetase after radical- or endonuclease-induced DNA strand breakage can cause nuclear protein polyribosylation and cell death by depletion of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ( 95 ).

Even with our current understanding of ALS pathogenesis, a number of questions must still be addressed. First, we need to understand how selective cell vulnerability arises in this and other forms of neurodegeneration. In ALS, such selectivity may in part rely on functional differences in protective mechanisms present in different cell types. For example, the calcium-binding proteins calbindin-D 28K and parvalbumin are absent in motoneurons lost early in ALS (i.e. cortical and spinal motoneurons and lower cranial nerve motoneurons) but are present at high immunoreactive levels in motoneurons damaged late or infrequently in the disease (i.e. Onuf's nucleus motoneurons and oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve neurons) ( 96 , 97 ). In addition, undifferentiated VSC 4.1 cells are far more resistant to cytotoxic effects of sALS IgG than are cAMP-differentiated cells. This finding is consistent with the presence of much higher immunoreactive calbindin and parvalbumin levels in undifferentiated VSC 4.1 cells ( 97 ). Thus, cell-specific differences in regulatory protein activity may help explain selective motoneuron vulnerability in ALS. 
 
Second, we need to understand how neurodegeneration progresses over the years. While transgenic mouse models may eventually help us explain the impact of SOD mutations in fALS, no good models yet exist with which to examine the potential slow effects of autoimmunity or excitotoxicity on motoneuron death in sALS. 
 
Finally, we as physicians must learn to more effectively treat patients with ALS. We are only now beginning to understand ALS pathogenesis, and therapies based on such knowledge are therefore limited. As for most endocrine diseases, treatment of ALS with conventional immunosuppressants has not stopped disease progression, perhaps because it is too little, too late. Indeed, type I diabetes mellitus, which is also resistant to standard immunosuppressant therapy, may result from pancreatic islet cell destruction initiated by antibody-mediated increased Ca 2+ entry through L-type VGCCs ( 98 ). Thus, treatments that affect the consequences of initial cell injury may be necessary to protect motoneurons in patients with ALS. Unfortunately, therapies designed to reduce excitotoxic cell injury are often associated with significant side effects, although medicines such as riluzole ( 99 ) are currently being tested. Although available antioxidants (1-deprenyl, α-tocopherol, vitamins A and C, etc) have not prevented ALS disease progression, new therapies that protect against oxygen radical formation are presently under development. Antiapoptotic agent use is also in its infancy, but its treatment potential for this disease will hopefully soon be assessed. In addition, because they protect motoneurons, various growth factors [insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)] are currently under investigation to determine their effectiveness in treating ALS. Still, until definitive remedies and gene therapies are available, helping ALS patients remains a considerable challenge for clinicians ( 100 ). 
 
In summary, exciting discoveries are revolutionizing our understanding of the mechanisms involved in ALS pathogenesis and motoneuron death. These ideas are being applied to other neurodegenerative diseases as well and will eventually permit the development of effective therapy.
