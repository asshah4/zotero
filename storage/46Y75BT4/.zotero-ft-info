Title:          Preoperative and Postoperative Assessment of Ultrasonographic Measurement of Inferior Vena Cava: A Prospective, Observational Study
Subject:        Background: Ultrasound measurement of dynamic changes in inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and collapsibility index (CI) are used to estimate the fluid responsiveness and intravascular volume status. We conducted an analysis to quantify the sonographic measurement of IVC diameter changes in adult patients at the preoperative and postoperative periods. Methods: Ultrasonography was performed on 72 patients scheduled for surgery with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III. Quantitative assessments of the end-expiration (Dmin), end-inspiration (Dmax), and CI at preoperative and postoperative period were compared in a prospective, observational study. The patients received intravenous fluid according to standard protocol regimes peroperatively. Results: Ultrasonography of IVC measurement was unsuccessful in 12.5% of patients and 63 patients remained for analyses. The mean age was 43.29  17.22 (range 18­86) years. The average diameter of the Dmin, Dmax, and dIVC preoperative and postoperative were 1.99  0.31 vs. 2.05  0.29 cm, 1.72  0.33 vs. 1.74  0.32 cm, 14.0  9.60% vs. 15.14  11.18%, respectively (p > 0.05). CI was positively associated preoperatively and postoperatively (regression coefficient = 0.438, p < 0.01). Conclusion: The diameter of the IVC did not change preoperatively and postoperatively in adult patients with standard fluid regimens. The parameters of the IVC diameter increased postoperatively according to the preoperative period.
