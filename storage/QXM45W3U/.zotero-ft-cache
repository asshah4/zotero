abstract
Despite major advances in medical therapies late mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) is still high. A substantial proportion of post-MI patients die from sudden cardiac death. Prophylactic implantable-cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD) therapy has been established for post-MI patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤35%). However, most patients who die after MI have an LVEF N35%. For this large group of patients, no speciﬁc prophylactic strategies exist. There is strong evidence that measures of cardiac autonomic dysfunction after MI provide important prognostic information in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF. Combinations of autonomic markers can identify high-risk patients after MI with LVEF N35% whose prognosis is equally worse than that of patients with LVEF ≤35%. The ongoing REFINE-ICD (NCT00673842) and SMART-MI trials (NCT02594488) test different preventive strategies in high-risk post-MI patients with cardiac autonomic dysfunction and LVEF 36–50%. While REFINE-ICD follows the traditional concept of ICD-implantation, SMART-MI uses implantable cardiac monitors with remote monitoring capabilities to sensitively detect asymptomatic, but prognostically relevant arrhythmias that could trigger speciﬁc diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

1. The clinical problem
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most common single cause of death in the industrialized world, claiming more than 4 million victims per year in Europe [1,2]. Most events occur in patients with structural heart disease, especially coronary artery disease (CAD) and after myocardial infarction (MI). It is assumed that up to 50% of cardiovascular deaths after MI occur suddenly and are thus potentially preventable by prophylactic implantation of a cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD).
Although the principle of prophylactic ICD-therapy has been invented by Michel Mirowski almost ﬁve decades ago [3], it was ignored for longtime by the medical community for various reasons. The publication of the successful MADIT-II study by Arthur Moss in 2002 could be seen as a milestone that paved the way towards the broad clinical adoption of prophylactic ICD-implantation [4]. The reason was not the efﬁcacy of prophylactic ICD-implantation in terms of a 31%-mortality reduction per se, it was the simplicity of the study design that was convincing: patients after MI basically needed to fulﬁll only one criterion, by which they qualiﬁed for prophylactic ICD-implantation, namely that of a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤30%). Later, further trials conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of prophylactic ICD-implantation in patients

with reduced LVEF (≤35%) [5], leading to a class I recommendation by current guidelines [1].
From an epidemiological point of view, the impact of these trials on SCD-prevention is only moderate, since patients with a reduced LVEF (≤35%) represent just the tip of the SCD population iceberg. LVEF and SCD-incidence are inversely related, with the vast majority of SCD victims having only a moderately impaired or normal LVEF [6]. This is also true for post-infarction patients, where sensitivities of around 30% for the low-LVEF criterion have been reported [7]. Hence, in order to address the SCD problem after MI effectively, we need to develop prophylactic strategies in patients with preserved LVEF. However, this patient group is large and generally at low risk, making risk-stratiﬁcation challenging. However, accurate identiﬁcation of high-risk patients after MI with preserved LVEF is the most crucial step and considered as an unsolvable problem by many [1].
This article focuses on measures of cardiac autonomic function to predict risk after MI and describes traditional as well as novel strategies to prevent SCD in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF.
2. Measures of cardiac autonomic function to predict risk after MI
There is compelling evidence that important prognostic information after MI can be derived from the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Both, loss of vagal activity and sympathetic overactivity after MI have been linked to poor prognosis. Over the last decades various non-

Fig. 1. Low-frequency (b0.1 Hz) oscillations of cardiac repolarization instability in a surviving post-infarction patient (A) and a post-infarction patient who suddenly died during follow-up (B). For assessment of repolarization instability, the spatio-temporal information of each T-wave is condensed into a three-dimensional vector and the angle between two successive vectors (dT°) is calculated. Thin gray lines show the pattern of dT°. Bold black lines show low-pass ﬁltered signals. Adapted from [11].

invasive and invasive measures including heart rate variability (HRV) [8], heart rate turbulence (HRT) [9] and baroreﬂex sensitivity (BRS) [10] have been proposed to quantify autonomic function and to predict risk. It is far beyond the scope of this article to review all methods in detail and to provide comparisons regarding their predictive values. All these measures consider changes of beat-to-beat (RR) intervals, either globally (HRV) or in response to speciﬁc triggering events (HRT, BRS), as read-out of autonomic activity. It might be a limitation that established measures assess autonomic activity at the level of the sinus node and not at the left ventricular myocardium where malignant arrhythmias arise.
Periodic Repolarization Dynamics (PRD) is a novel autonomic marker that substantially differs from the above-mentioned methods [11]. PRD refers to previously unknown oscillations of cardiac repolarization in the low-frequency range (b 0.1 Hz, Fig. 1) and therefore does not rely on the analysis of RR-interval changes. Indeed, it could be shown by use of ﬁxed atrial stimulation that PRD-oscillations occur independently from underlying heart rate variability [11]. Although the exact underlying physiological mechanisms need to be elucidated, existing data suggest that PRD reﬂects the ventricular response to phasic sympathetic activation which is known to take place in the low-frequency range [12]. This hypothesis is supported by pharmacological studies which showed that PRD is suppressed by blockade of beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Conversely, PRD is enhanced by physiological provocations that lead to sympathetic activation. In post-infarction patients and patients

with stable CAD, increased PRD is associated with poor outcomes, independently from established risk factors including LVEF, HRV or T-wave alternans [11]. However, future studies are needed to test whether PRD might be a more speciﬁc marker of arrhythmic events (or mortality per se) than other markers of autonomic function.
Although single autonomic markers have been shown to provide strong and independent prognostic information in many studies, risk prediction can be optimized by combining measures that capture different facets of autonomic function. Strong combinations result from combinations of tonic and reﬂex-based measures, including Severe Autonomic Failure (combination of deceleration capacity [13] and heart rate turbulence) [7] and Tonic and Reﬂex Vagal Activity (combination of HRV and baroreﬂex sensitivity) [14]. Such combinations are very capable of identifying high-risk post-MI patients with preserved LVEF. Fig. 2 exemplarily shows risk prediction by the combination of deceleration capacity [13] and PRD [11], reﬂecting vagal and sympathetic function, that is also being used in the ongoing SMART-MI trial (see below).
3. Asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmias as precursors of lifethreatening complications
The CARISMA study fundamentally expanded our knowledge of post-infarction arrhythmias [15] which may have important implications for future preventive strategies. CARISMA used implantable cardiac monitors (ICM) in 297 post-MI patients with LVEF ≤ 40% which

allowed to systematically document post-MI arrhythmias. Within two years of follow-up, predeﬁned brady- and tachyarrhythmias were recorded in almost half (46%) of the patients. Almost one third of the patients (28%) developed new-onset atrial ﬁbrillation and 10% experienced high-degree AV-block. The incidence of malignant tachyarrhythmias was lower (3%). Although most arrhythmias (86%) were asymptomatic, they had important prognostic implications, with bradyarrhythmias being the most important predictors of death [15]. New onset atrial ﬁbrillation was associated with an increased risk of developing brady- and tachyarrhythmias [16]. Interestingly, cardiac autonomic dysfunction at baseline predicted both, new onset atrial ﬁbrillation [17] and high degree AV-block [18].
4. Preventive strategies — traditional and novel concepts
Implanting ICDs in post-infarction patients at high risk for SCD appears to be the most logical approach. The REFINE-ICD trial (NCT00673842) follows that concept. Post-infarction patients (2– 60 months after MI) with LVEF 36–50% are screened by Holter monitoring for the presence of cardiac autonomic dysfunction. 1000 patients with abnormal HRT [9] and abnormal T-wave alternans [19] are randomized to ICD-implantation or conventional follow-up.
In contrast, the ongoing multicenter, randomized SMART-MI trial (NCT02594488) follows a novel holistic approach. Survivors of MI may suffer from various complications in the years after MI that ultimately lead to death, including re-infarction, progression of heart failure, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias. Although the ﬁnal rhythm may be VT/VF in many cases, malignant arrhythmias are often sequelae of preceding complications. As learned from CARISMA [15], those complications are often preceded by asymptomatic arrhythmias, detectable by an ICM, which could serve as warning signals and open a time frame for preemptive interventions. In SMART-MI survivors of acute MI and LVEF of 36–50% are screened for the presence of cardiac autonomic dysfunction by means of abnormal deceleration capacity [13] or abnormal PRD [11] (see also Fig. 2). 400 high-risk patients are randomized to ICM-based remote monitoring or conventional followup. In case of predeﬁned arrhythmias patients undergo immediate diagnostic evaluation. Predeﬁned arrhythmias include arrhythmias that have either been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes (stroke, death) or fulﬁll established criteria for ICD-therapies (shock or ATP). Treatment paths have been developed for different kinds of arrhythmias and may include optimization of medical therapy, oral anticoagulation (in case of atrial ﬁbrillation), revascularization or device therapy.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, autonomic testing can identify high-risk postinfarction patients with preserved LVEF who have the same poor prognosis as patients with reduced LVEF. REFINE-ICD and SMART-MI are ongoing interventional trials that test different preventive strategies in these patients.
