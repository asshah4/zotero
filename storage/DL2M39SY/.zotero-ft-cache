OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to describe CT findings of miscellaneous pulmonary conditions that mimic lung cancers, especially primary cancers, to improve diagnosis of pulmonary lesions. Brief descriptions of patient clinical information and pathologic findings will be included and correlated with imaging findings in actual cases.
CONCLUSION. A wide variety of pulmonary conditions present imaging features that mimic those of primary lung cancers and are difficult to differentiate from cancer. Awareness of these conditions with an understanding of their pathologic background and careful attention to the clinical information will help achieve correct diagnoses.

G

reat improvement in CT, especially in high-resolution CT (HRCT) and MDCT with isotropic volumetric CT examination, has made

it possible to show precisely the morphologic

characteristics of a disease and, thus, make

correct imaging diagnoses of lung cancer

possible in many cases [1–3]. However, mis-

cellaneous conditions produce CT findings

that mimic those of primary cancers, and dif-

ferentiating their imaging findings from can-

cers still remains difficult, even with the cur-

rent CT techniques [4]. In this article, we will

discuss these pulmonary conditions that mim-

ic primary lung cancers. The clinical condi-

tions and their pathologic correlations of ac-

tual cases will also be described.

Pulmonary conditions can be grossly clas-

sified into three categories: ground-glass

opacification (GGO; both pure and mixed),

solid nodules and masses, and consolidation

on HRCT. We will focus on GGO and sol-

id nodules and masses in this article because

clinical difficulties in the differentiation of

the benignity or malignancy of a pulmonary

lesion occur much more frequently in these

two types than with consolidative diseases.

Ground-Glass Opacification GGO is defined as a hazy opacity that pre-
serves underlying bronchial and vascular margins on HRCT [5, 6]. Nonneoplastic GGO is caused by partial airspace filling, interstitial thickening with inflammation, edema, fibrosis, partial collapse of alveoli, or focal hem-

orrhage [7, 8]. Neoplastic GGO results mainly from alveolar wall covering tumor growth or hemorrhagic tumor [8, 9]. GGO can be classified into pure GGO and halo or mixed GGO types according to the presence or absence of solid components. The halo sign represents the ground-glass opacity surrounding the circumference of a nodule or mass [5, 6]. A mixed GGO is a nodule that has both GGO and solid components.
Pure GGO Adenocarcinoma in situ (nonmucinous
type) shows pure GGO on HRCT (Fig. 1). Differential diagnosis of it includes atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, focal fibrosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and acute inflammation [8, 10–12].
Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia—Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) is a peripheral focal lesion produced by proliferation of atypical cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells along the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles [13, 14]. AAH is a putative precursor of adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma in situ [14]. It presents as a round or oval pure GGO nodule without pleural indentation or vascular convergence. AAH is usually smaller than 5 mm in diameter, though it may be as large as 10–17 mm, and is indistinguishable from nonmucinous adenocarcinoma in situ that manifests as pure GGO on HRCT [10–12, 15] (Fig. 2).
Focal fibrosis—Focal fibrosis is a benign nonneoplastic disease often manifesting as a GGO that sometimes retains the same configuration

CT Mimics of Lung Cancer

over a long period and often produces the same imaging findings as neoplastic GGO [8, 10, 12, 16]. It presents as GGO with a round, polygonal, spiculated, or ill-defined margin on HRCT [17]. Pathologically, it appears as a focal interstitial septal thickening with fibroblast proliferation and preservation of alveolar airspaces and macrophage-filled alveoli [12, 17] (Fig. 3).
Halo or Mixed GGO In nonneoplastic lesions, these patterns are
mainly seen in cases with hemorrhagic nodules, such as invasive aspergillosis and Wegener granulomatosis [9] (Fig. 4). The lesions are difficult to distinguish from a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, with a halo sign or mixed GGO on HRCT resulting from predominant lepidic tumor growth (Fig. 5). Careful attention to the patient’s clinical information will help in making the correct diagnosis.
Solid Nodules and Masses The main pulmonary conditions that mani-
fest as solid nodules and masses mimicking lung cancer are neoplastic (e.g., hamartoma, pneumocytoma [sclerosing hemangioma], inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and lymphoma) and nonneoplastic (e.g., intrapulmonary lymph node, tumorlet, tuberculoma, histoplasmoma, rounded atelectasis, amyloidosis, focal organizing pneumonia, and lung abscess).
Hamartoma Hamartoma is a benign neoplasm com-
posed of mesenchymal tissues such as cartilage, fat, connective tissue, smooth muscle, and calcification. Pathologically, it sometimes shows slitlike clefts lined by entrapped ciliated epithelium. Hamartoma accounts for 6–8% of solitary lung tumors and 77% of all benign tumors [18, 19]. Typical CT findings consist of a well-defined, smooth, round, or lobulated nodule or mass [20]. Fat is recognized on the CT image in about 60% of cases, and popcornlike calcification or central calcification in about 25% [20]. A hamartoma with little fat and no calcification is difficult to distinguish on CT from primary lung cancer with a round or lobulated margin (Fig. 6).
Pneumocytoma (Sclerosing Hemangioma) Pneumocytoma is a rare benign tumor
predominantly found in middle-aged women. The female-to-male ratio is approximately 4–5:1 [21]. Histologically, the essence is proliferation of type 2 pneumocytes, and a pneumocytoma consists of four major histologic components: solid, papillary, sclerotic,

and hemangiomatous [13]. Though low-attenuation areas, calcification, and, rarely, airmeniscus sign are sometimes present on CT, most cases usually show a smoothly marginated, homogeneously well-enhanced, round, or oval nodule or mass, and differentiation from solid lung cancer with round or oval margins is difficult on CT [22, 23] (Fig. 7). Histologic confusion with adenocarcinoma with lepidic tumor growth also occurs occasionally, with specimens obtained from not only transbronchial lung biopsy but also frozen sections, especially when the specimen contains only papillary components [24].
Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor Because of its variable cellular compo-
nents, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) has been described by various terms, including inflammatory pseudotumor, fibrous histiocytoma, xanthogranuloma, and plasma cell granuloma [13]. It is an uncommon lesion composed of spindle myofibroblasts on a variable background of collagen and inflammatory cells [13]. The spindle cell components express vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin on immunostaining. Although it has a wide spectrum of benign reactive-tomalignant characteristics and the true nature of these lesions has not been fully elucidated, the expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase 1 in about 56% of cases suggests that they may be neoplastic [25, 26].
IMT is most frequently found in the lung [13]. Endobronchial or endotracheal lesions occur occasionally, and it can occur in all other organs. Though it occurs at all ages, it frequently is found in children and adults younger than 40 years [13]. Most patients are asymptomatic, but sometimes patients present with cough, hemosputum, and sometimes a history of previous infection. Most cases of IMT are diagnosed and cured by surgical resection. The prognosis is excellent. Overall survival at 5 years is 91%, although relapse has been reported in patients who underwent incomplete resection [27]. The tumor usually manifests as a well-defined lobulated or round solitary peripheral pulmonary nodule or mass on CT [28]. It occasionally shows consolidation or a nodule with an ill-defined margin or spiculations mimicking lung cancer [28]. The internal structure is homogeneous or heterogeneous with hemorrhage, necrosis, and calcification, and shows varying degrees of contrast enhancement [29]. The varied CT manifestations make it difficult to make a correct imaging diagnosis (Fig. 8).

Intrapulmonary Lymph Node Intrapulmonary lymph nodes are com-
monly found in the pulmonary hilum, but they can also occur within the lung parenchyma, most commonly in the subpleural zone of the lower lobes [30, 31]. They are often found in smokers.
As CT has improved and more CT examinations have been performed, incidental intrapulmonary lymph nodes have been found more often. They are usually a single nodule smaller than 10 mm in diameter, with 10% of cases having two or more lesions [30]. Pathologically, they are normal lymph nodes with a capsule and lymphoid follicles [30, 32]. Though they commonly present as well-defined oval nodules (Fig. 9), sometimes they show spiculations, pleural indentation, fuzzy margin, and vascular involvement, mimicking primary lung cancer [32]. Though they usually remain the same size for many years, a few cases grow rapidly and are difficult to differentiate from cancer [33].
Pulmonary Tumorlets Pulmonary tumorlets refer to a minute
nodular proliferation of airway neuroendocrine cells (Kulchitsky cells) that extends beyond the epithelium into the adjacent wall or lung parenchyma [13, 34]. Histologically, a tumorlet consists of nests of oval to spindle-shaped cells. Neuroendocrine granules are seen on electron microscopy, and polypeptides similar to those in carcinoid are present in the tumorlet. It has a benign nonneoplastic nature. It is often associated with damaged and ectatic small airways or carcinoid tumor itself and ranges in size from microscopic to 5–8 mm in diameter. A nodule bigger than this size should be considered a carcinoid. Because of their minute size, they are not usually apparent on CT but are found incidentally at histopathologic examination, frequently as multiple tiny lesions. If visualized on HRCT, they show well-defined tiny nodules and are difficult to differentiate from cancer, especially from metastatic cancer in the case of multiple lesions [35] (Fig. 10).
Tuberculoma and Histoplasmoma Pulmonary tuberculosis may present as an
asymptomatic solitary pulmonary nodule called a tuberculoma, and histoplasmosis may present as a histoplasmoma in immunocompetent patients [36]. They sometimes mimic lung cancer.
A tuberculoma is a well-defined round or oval focus of parenchymal tuberculosis [36]. Sometimes calcification and cavitation in the

nodule or satellite nodules can be seen and help in the imaging diagnosis [36, 37]. Pathologically, the central region of the tuberculoma consists of caseous necrosis and a marginal zone of epithelioid granuloma, inflammatory cells, and collagen. Tuberculomas show a variable contrast-enhancement pattern, depending on the inflammatory process on contrast-enhanced CT, though most of them show a central low-attenuation area surrounded by ring enhancement, reflecting central necrosis and granulomatous inflammatory tissue in the outer zone [38, 39]. This CT enhancement pattern is also found in lung cancer with necrosis. Tuberculomas most commonly appear as smoothly marginated round nodules on CT [36, 37]. However, tuberculomas sometimes have spiculated margins, especially when the background parenchyma is emphysematous or fibrotic, making them difficult to distinguish from cancer with fine spiculations [4, 36] (Fig. 11).
Histoplasmoma is a chronic form of pulmonary histoplasmosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum that may or may not be associated with a history of symptomatic disease [36]. It usually is seen as a sharply defined nodule. It may have a central zone of calcification, may be diffusely calcified, or may be accompanied by small satellite nodules that resemble a tuberculoma [36, 40]. The presence of central or diffuse calcification in a nodule 3 cm or smaller in diameter is virtually diagnostic of a granuloma [36]. In an area where histoplasmosis is endemic, H. capsulatum is the most likely cause; however, in the absence of calcification, the differential diagnosis must include all other causes of solitary or multiple nodules, including primary lung cancer [36, 40, 41]. Occasionally, a histoplasmoma shows shaggy or irregular edge mimicking lung cancer [40].
Rounded Atelectasis Rounded atelectasis is a focal pleural-
based lesion that is the result of pleural and subpleural scarring and atelectasis of the adjacent lung tissue [42]. It occurs most often in the dorsal subpleural regions of the lower lobe in patients with a history of asbestos exposure and in patients with tuberculosis [42]. Pathologic examinations show pleural fibrosis overlying the abnormal parenchyma, as well as invaginations of fibrotic pleura into the collapsed parenchyma. Characteristic CT findings consist of a round mass at the lung base adjacent to the pleural thickening and a comet-tail sign—that is, vessels and bronchi con-

verge on and swirl around the mass. It may appear as an air bronchogram [43]. It sometimes shows a mass with a wedge-shaped or irregular margin on CT that is confused with a malignant tumor (Fig. 12). Correct diagnosis is very important, especially in patients exposed to asbestos owing to the increased incidence of malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer. Good homogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT is a clue for differentiating it from malignancy [44]. Fluorine-18-FDG PET can also help in correct diagnosis because the atelectasis found is most commonly metabolically inactive [45].
Pulmonary Amyloidosis Amyloidosis is the accumulation of vari-
ous abnormal insoluble fibrillar proteins (amyloid) in the extracellular space. The most frequent amyloid found in the lung is amyloid light chain [46]. Amyloidosis can affect the lung as either a primary or secondary type, and as a systemic type or as a disease limited to the lung. Amyloidosis that manifests primarily in the lower respiratory tract can be divided into three types: tracheobronchial, nodular parenchymal, and diffuse parenchymal (also termed alveolar septal) amyloidosis. Nodular parenchymal amyloidosis presents as a single or multiple peripheral pulmonary nodules in a wide variety of sizes with a round, lobulated, serrated, or spiculated margin [47]. Cavitation is seen in up to 20% of cases and calcification is seen in 20–50% on CT scans [47]. It may grow very slowly over years. Poor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT is reported in cases of pulmonary amyloidosis [48]. Usually, patients with nodular amyloidosis are asymptomatic. Differentiation from lung cancer on CT is difficult, especially in cases with an uncalcified solitary nodule with an irregular margin [47, 48] (Fig. 13). Low signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI resulting from a short T2 relaxation time due to amyloid protein may help in the diagnosis [48].
Lung Abscess Lung abscess is often associated with bac-
terial pneumonia or is preceded by aspiration. The organisms are often anaerobic bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Nocardia and Actinomyces species [49]. Aspiration occurs especially in patients with alcoholism, mental retardation, poor dental hygiene, and immune suppression [36, 49]. Imaging findings comprise single or multiple lung masses or nodules, often with cavities, which are

sometimes subsolid in the chronic phase [36, 49]. They may be isolated or occur within areas of consolidation [36, 40]. In most cases, the walls of the cavities are smooth and less than 15 mm thick [36, 50]. An irregular and thick wall (> 15 mm) is occasionally seen and, in such cases, it resembles cavitated lung cancer [50]. Lung abscess may also manifest as a nonspecific consolidation or nodular opacity, and differentiation from cancer is challenging in the latter case [4] (Fig. 14).
Focal Organizing Pneumonia Focal organizing pneumonia is referred to
as unresolving pneumonia or pneumonia with a delayed resolution, but there is no clear clinical definition [51]. It consists histologically of polypoid granulation tissue in the alveolar spaces and peripheral bronchial lumen associated with chronic inflammatory infiltrate [51].
It shows a wide variety of CT findings. Usually, it shows consolidation. On the other hand, focal organizing pneumonia may present as a nodule with an oval or spindle-shaped margin and satellite lesions. Sometimes the CT images of focal organizing pneumonia show a nodule with a spiculated margin, air bronchogram, bubblelike lucency, halo sign, mixed GGO, and pleural indentation resembling primary lung cancer [52, 53]. Differentiation from lung cancer is difficult, and many patients undergo surgery in such cases [52, 53]. Not only in focal organizing pneumonia but also in other inflammatory nodules as well, the margins are sometimes concave with a few rough spiculations [4]. One report postulated that retraction of the affected lobule, in contrast to intact adjacent lobules, causes a concave margin in the healing process of the inflammation [54]. It sometimes mimics primary lung cancer with spiculated margin [4]. The differentiation between such inflammatory nodules and lung cancer is difficult [4, 52, 53] (Fig. 15).
Lymphoma Primary lymphoma of the lung is rare.
Most are marginal zone B cell lymphomas arising from mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, which is categorized as a low-grade malignancy [13]. Formerly referred to as “pseudolymphoma,” this category is now considered to consist of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, and other low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders [13, 55, 56].
Secondary pulmonary lymphoma occurs more frequently than primary lymphoma. A

CT Mimics of Lung Cancer

wide variety of CT findings are found in primary and secondary lymphoma: single or multiple pulmonary nodules and masses, consolidation, GGO, air bronchogram, cavities, and peribronchovascular thickening [55, 56]. Sometimes lymphoma manifests as a nodule or mass resembling a primary or metastatic lung cancer in the CT images [55–57] (Fig. 16).
Conclusion A wide variety of pulmonary conditions
produce radiologic findings that mimic lung cancers. Understanding these conditions and their pathologic backgrounds combined with careful attention to the clinical information will help in making correct diagnoses.
