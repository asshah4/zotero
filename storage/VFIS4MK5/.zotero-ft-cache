Abstract 
HONEY bees (Apis mellifera L.) attract each other by a variety of biological stimuli. The olfactory stimulus produced by the worker bees has received attention during a number of investigations ever since Sladen 1 suggested that the attractant odour originated from a special organ discovered by Nassanoff in 1883. This scent organ is located on the anterior part of the seventh abdominal tergum of the worker bee.
