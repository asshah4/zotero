Conclusions

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region that have been associated with atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) contribute to the variable penetrance of familial AF.
Although mutations in ion channels, gap junction proteins, and signaling molecules have been described for Mendelian forms of AF, penetrance is highly variable. Recent studies have consistently identiﬁed 2 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region as independent AF susceptibility alleles.
Eleven families in which AF was present in Ն2 members who also shared a candidate gene mutation were studied. These mutations were identiﬁed in all subjects with familial lone AF (n ϭ 33) as well as apparently unaffected family members (age Ͼ50 years with no AF; n ϭ 17).
Mutations were identiﬁed in SCN5A (n ϭ 6), NPPA (n ϭ 2), KCNQ1 (n ϭ 1), KCNA5 (n ϭ 1), and NKX2.5 (n ϭ 1). In genetic association analyses, unstratiﬁed and stratiﬁed according to age of onset of AF and unaffected age Ͼ50 years, there was a highly statistically signiﬁcant association between the presence of both common (rs2200733 and rs10033464) and rare variants and AF (unstratiﬁed p ϭ 1 ϫ 10Ϫ8, stratiﬁed [age of onset Ͻ50 years and unaffected age Ͼ50 years] p ϭ 7.6 ϫ 10Ϫ5) (unstratiﬁed p Ͻ 0.0001, stratiﬁed [age of onset Ͻ50 years and unaffected age Ͼ50 years] p Ͻ 0.0001). Genetic association analyses showed that the presence of common 4q25 risk alleles predicted whether carriers of rare mutations developed AF (p ϭ 2.2 ϫ 10Ϫ4).
Common AF-associated 4q25 polymorphisms modify the clinical expression of latent cardiac ion channel and signaling molecule gene mutations associated with familial AF. These ﬁndings support the idea that the genetic architecture of AF is complex and includes both rare and common genetic variants.

Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is an important and increasing public health problem. The prevalence of AF doubles for each advancing decade of life, and there is widespread agreement that the prevalence is increasing over time (1,2). The risk factors for AF are multifactorial and include male sex, advancing age, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and valvular heart disease. However, a substantial portion of the variability in risk for AF remains unexplained, leading investigators to search for genetic factors.

Investigators at the Framingham Heart Study have observed that the odds ratio (OR) of developing AF was 1.8 times higher for subjects with at least 1 parent diagnosed with AF compared with those without such a parental history (3). The OR increased further (to 3.2) if 1 parent was affected before 75 years of age. In a population-based cohort of more

than 5,000 patients with AF from Iceland, ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients with AF were 1.77-fold more likely to have AF than the general population, with a relative risk of 4.67 in ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients Ͻ60 years of age (4). Familial aggregation of AF is particularly prominent in patients with idiopathic or so-called lone AF (i.e., early-onset AF without structural heart disease), for which as many as 30% of probands have ﬁrst-degree relatives with the arrhythmia (5–7).
Although a Mendelian pattern of inheritance has been reported, large AF kindreds such as those used to identify

genital long-QT syndrome) are unusual. A common presentation of the Mendelian form of the arrhythmia is a proband with familial lone AF (6). Mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channels, gap junction proteins, atrial

natriuretic peptide and nucleo-

porins (Nup155) have been reported in isolated cases and

small kindreds (8). Although traditional linkage analysis and

candidate gene approaches have been successful in identi-

fying monogenic forms of familial lone AF, the mode of

transmission for most forms of AF remains unclear, sup-

porting the idea that AF inheritance is complex.

In 2007, a genome-wide association study in Icelanders

identiﬁed a locus on chromosome 4q25 associated with AF

in subjects of all ages (9). Within this locus, 2 noncoding

single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were indepen-

dently associated with AF, and these ﬁndings were repli-

cated in 2 populations of European descent and 1 of Asian

descent. The SNP most strongly associated with AF,

rs2200733, conferred a 1.71-fold increased risk for AF,

while the other SNP, rs10033464, conferred a 1.42-fold

increased risk. Recently, this association was replicated in a

study of 4 large populations with ambulatory AF (10). This

association has also been reported for post-cardiac surgery

AF, a setting thought to be related to inﬂammation (11),

and has recently been reported to predict the likelihood of

successful AF ablation (12). Although mutations in ion

channels, gap junction proteins, and signaling molecules

have been identiﬁed in isolated kindreds with 2 or more

members affected with familial lone AF, penetrance in these

families is highly variable. One potential explanation for this

phenomenon is the coexistence of modiﬁer gene alleles,

possibly common SNPs altering AF susceptibility. In this

study, we tested the hypothesis that 4q25 genotypes con-

tribute to the variable penetrance of the AF phenotype in

familial AF.

Methods
Vanderbilt AF Registry. Between November 2002 and July 2009, subjects with AF were prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF Registry, which comprises clinical and genetic databases (13). At enrollment, detailed medical and drug histories were obtained from all patients; patients were also asked to complete a symptom questionnaire. Patients were recruited from the Vanderbilt Cardiology and Arrhythmia Clinics, the emergency department, and inpatient services. Echocardiography was performed in all patients at the time of enrollment into the registry. The upper limits of normal for cardiac chamber dimensions are based on age and body surface area. Subjects Ͼ18 years of age with diagnoses of AF conﬁrmed by electrocardiography who

presented because of symptoms or who were diagnosed during routine physical examinations were included in the Vanderbilt AF Registry. Subjects were excluded if AF was diagnosed in the setting of recent cardiac surgery or if they were unable to give informed consent or report for followup. The study protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University institutional review board, and participants were enrolled after providing written informed consent.
AF probands and their relatives were clinically classiﬁed by a consistently applied set of deﬁnitions. AF was deﬁned as the replacement of sinus P waves by rapid oscillations or ﬁbrillatory waves that varied in size, shape, and timing and were associated with an irregular ventricular response when atrioventricular conduction was intact. Documentation of AF on electrocardiography, rhythm strip, event recorder, or Holter monitor recording was necessary. Paroxysmal AF was deﬁned as AF lasting more than 30 s that terminated spontaneously. Persistent AF was deﬁned as AF lasting more than 7 days and requiring either pharmacologic therapy or electrical cardioversion for termination. AF that was refractory to cardioversion or that was allowed to continue was classiﬁed as permanent. Study cohort. The relationship between clinical phenotype (familial lone AF) and genotype was determined for probands in whom ion channel and other gene mutations were identiﬁed, together with their relatives. A total of 70 subjects in 11 kindreds had complete phenotype and genotype data available for analysis (Table 1), and this group formed the study cohort. Clinical phenotype. The clinical phenotype evaluated in this study was lone familial AF, deﬁned as AF occurring in patients Ͻ66 years of age without hypertension, overt structural heart disease, or thyroid dysfunction (as determined by clinical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and normal thyroid function test results) and AF in 1 or more ﬁrst-degree relatives (5,6). Left ventricular hypertrophy was deﬁned as a left ventricular mass index Ն150 g/m2 (14). All familial lone AF probands had left ventricular mass indexes Ͻ150 g/m2.
Familial AF was deﬁned as the presence of AF in 1 or more ﬁrst-degree relatives of the index case. Although the proband in each family had to have lone AF, other family members were classiﬁed as affected if they had AF, despite structural heart disease. Family history information was initially obtained from the medical record and was supplemented by a questionnaire detailing medical history, family history, and clinical symptoms. For lone AF probands with positive family histories, family members were contacted, and more detailed personal medical histories were obtained. Family members were then sent a blood kit for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction, and written permission was obtained to review their medical records. We routinely evaluate for the presence of asymptomatic AF by providing all unaffected family members who consent to participate in the study with a 7-day full-disclosure continuous monitor. In addition, individuals with symptoms suggestive for AF

Screening for mutations in ion channel and other genes. Whole blood was collected for genomic DNA extraction and analysis from lone AF probands and as many ﬁrstdegree relatives as would consent to the study. Mutational analyses of SCN5A (15), KCNQ1 (16), NPPA (16), KCNA5

(17), and NKX2.5 genes were performed in lone AF probands and all consented family members. The coding and ﬂanking regions were ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed to obtain fragments of appropriate size, as previously described (15–17). Brieﬂy, polymerase chain reaction–ampliﬁed DNA fragments were analyzed using the Reveal Discovery System (based on

q25 genotypes. Genotyping of the 2 SNPs (rs2200733 and rs10033464) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, iPLEX single base primer extension, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry in a 384-well format (Sequenom, San Diego, California) as previously described (18). Seventy subjects (11 familial lone AF probands and 69 family members) underwent genotyping at the 2 common 4q25 SNPs. Statistical analysis. The goal of these analyses was to determine if there is a statistically signiﬁcant association between the presence of both common and rare AF variants and the development of AF (i.e., AF disease status). We hypothesized that the common variants on 4q25 inﬂuence the development of AF by modulating the rare ion channel and non–ion channel mutations. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst performed a series of chi-square tests (2 ϫ 2 tables) of association (using Yates’s correction test for small sample size) with 1 degree of freedom. We initially performed an unstratiﬁed analysis, followed by 5 stratiﬁed analyses on the basis of the age at onset of AF and the age of the controls. Because most lone AF probands develop AF before the age of 50 years, our ﬁrst age cutoff for AF age of onset was Ͻ50 years, but we also stratiﬁed on the basis of an AF age of onset of Ͻ40 years. Thus, we stratiﬁed by AF age at onset Ͻ50 years, AF age at onset Ͻ40 years, unaffected subjects age Ͼ50 years only, and the 2 possible combinations of these 3 criteria. We collapsed the common variant genotypes into an allelic test of the presence and absence of the variant allele. The nominal p values as well as p values generated with permutation testing were determined.
Permutation testing was performed to correct for multiple testing, while controlling for the familial relationships in the kindreds. The process involved removing the AF affection

status within each family and randomly reassigning in the same proportion of affected and unaffected individuals. This was carried out in each family, 1,000 times, to create 1,000 null datasets. In each random dataset, we performed association analysis and recorded the chi-square statistic. After 1,000 analyses, we had an empirical distribution from which to assign a permutation p value, which is adjusted for the relatedness in the dataset. In addition, we performed the analyses by way of the presence or absence of rare variants (ignoring the common variant).
As a follow-up, we performed a second series of chisquare analyses (using Yates’s correction as appropriate). Here, we restricted the dataset to include only those subjects who possessed a rare variant in the ion channel or non–ion channel genes sequenced; these analyses included 48 subjects. In this set, we performed the identical series of chi-square analyses as described previously, although here, we were looking at the association of the common variant with AF status; all subjects possessed a rare variant in this set. We performed the unstratiﬁed analysis ﬁrst, followed by 5 stratiﬁed analyses. We again stratiﬁed by AF age at onset Ͻ50 years, AF age at onset Ͻ40 years, unaffected individuals age Ͼ50 years only, and the two possible combinations of those 3 criteria. All chi-square tests of association were performed in JMP version 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
Results
Study cohort. Our candidate gene approach to identifying novel mutations or rare variants associated with AF identiﬁed 11 familial lone AF probands who had 1 or more ﬁrst-degree relatives with the arrhythmia. The total study cohort consisted of 70 subjects in 11 kindreds who had complete phenotype and genotype data available for analysis (Table 2). Novel SCN5A variants. During the initial 3-year enrollment period, 396 patients with AF were approached, and 375 (95%) agreed to participate in the Vanderbilt AF Registry (15). Within this cohort, 118 patients (31%) had familial lone AF. As previously reported, resequencing identiﬁed 8 novel variants in 10 probands (2.7%) that were not found in the population-based controls (0%) (p ϭ .001) (15). Genotyping was performed in 6 of these kindreds with 2 or more affected subjects with AF (Fig. 1). The novel variants identiﬁed affect highly conserved residues in the SCN5A protein. All probands identiﬁed were heterozygous for the mutation. KCNQ1 variant. In this study cohort of 231 subjects with familial lone AF, screening for KCNQ1 mutations in genomic DNA identiﬁed a unique sequence variant in 1 case of familial AF (AF313) (16). In the proband, a 9-bp duplication resulting in insertion of the amino acids isoleucine, alanine, and proline at locations 54 to 56 (IAP54-56) in the N-terminus of the KCNQ1 protein was identiﬁed. The variant was also conﬁrmed in 3 affected family mem-

bers. The sequence change was not found in Caucasian, Han Chinese, or Asian population controls but was identiﬁed in 2.1% (2 of 94) of African American subjects. Because the controls were obtained from the anonymous Coriell repository, no clinical information about these subjects is available. NPPA variants. Genomic DNA sequencing of NPPA identiﬁed 2 novel missense mutations in 2 Caucasian AF kindreds; S64R in AF1111 (16) and A117V in AF673 (Fig. 1). The S64R mutation was also conﬁrmed in 2 affected family members but was absent in unaffected family members. Furthermore, both mutations were not identiﬁed in Caucasian, Han Chinese, Asian, or African American population controls. The A117V mutation was identiﬁed in a family with lone AF (Fig. 1). The kindred included 6 family members, 3 of whom were heterozygous for the mutation, with the proband presenting with early-onset paroxysmal lone AF.

KCNA5 variant. We resequenced KCNA5 in 231 subjects with familial lone AF and identiﬁed a novel 33-bp coding region deletion in 2 Caucasian probands with early-onset lone AF. The variant results in the deletion of 11 amino acids at positions 71 to 81 of the N-terminus (71-81del) (17). The sequence change was not found in 200 patients with typical AF and 300 ethnically matched population controls. The proband in this kindred (AF579) presented with symptomatic paroxysmal familial lone AF, and his AF is currently managed with sotalol. A family history also showed that most of the affected family members developed familial lone AF at relatively young ages, and most presented with symptomatic paroxysmal AF. NKX2.5 variant. NKX2.5 was screened in 160 familial lone AF patients. We identiﬁed 1 novel nonsynonymous variant (F145S) that was not identiﬁed in more than 300 control patients with no history of AF. The proband in this kindred (AF027) presented with early-onset symptomatic familial

Table 3 shows a signiﬁcant interaction between common and rare genetic variants on the basis of an AF age of onset Ͻ50 years. However, when we stratiﬁed on the basis of AF age of onset Ͻ40 years and the ages of unaffected subjects in the families, there remained a significant association between the presence of common and rare genetic variants (Table 4). Furthermore, when we examined the genetic association of rare variants alone (ignoring common variants) unstratiﬁed and stratiﬁed by age of onset and the ages of unaffected subjects in the families, there remained a highly statistically signiﬁcant association between the presence of both common and rare variants and AF disease status (Table 5). ORs were calculated for the test of co-occurrence of rare and common variants, in the unstratiﬁed and stratiﬁed analyses. The ORs ranged from 4 to 452 for the different strata; these values are far in excess of the 1.4 to 1.7 reported for studies in the general population, thus supporting the idea that these common variants modulate penetrance of the AF phenotype in these kindreds. ORs could not be calculated for the presence of common variants in those subjects with rare variants only because the contingency table cells contained zero counts.
We performed a logistic regression analysis with 2 main effect terms (presence or absence of rare variants and presence or absence of common variants) in addition to a multiplicative interaction term (presence or absence of rare variants ϫ presence or absence of common variants). On the basis of the likelihood ratio test, there was a highly signiﬁcant interaction (p ϭ 0.002).

Discussion
The present ﬁndings provide strong evidence that 2 common AF-associated polymorphisms act as genetic modiﬁers of the clinical expression of latent cardiac ion channel and signaling gene mutations associated with familial AF. Furthermore, our ﬁndings strongly support the idea that AF inheritance is complex and non-Mendelian.
Although the potential mechanism of action of variants at the chromosome 4q25 locus tagged by the 2 noncoding SNPs remains unknown, it is quite likely mediated through effects on the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) gene. PITX2 plays a critical role in left-right asymmetry, and loss of the pitx2c isoform in mice can lead to right atrial isomerization and failure to suppress a default pathway for sinus node development of the pulmonary myocardium (19 –21). Importantly, this area is now well recognized as a common source for ectopic atrial activity necessary for the initiation and propagation of AF (22). Microarray analysis of pitx2 null-mutant and control mice hearts has revealed up-regulation of Kcnq1, a potassium channel gene that has been associated with gain-of-function mutations in familial AF (19,20). More recently, Kirchhof et al. (23) performed expression arrays in pitx2ϩ/Ϫ mice demonstrating alteration in a number of cellular and molecular pathways in addition to potassium channels, which might provide an explanation for why mutations in ion channels are associated with familial AF. These recent data strongly support our hypothesis that the 4q25 AF susceptibility alleles likely mediate their effects by the modulation of cardiac ion channel expression and signaling proteins in the heart.
Investigating the genetic basis for AF presents a number of important challenges (8). The paroxysmal nature and variable symptoms in AF, a high prevalence in the general population, and a late age of onset in many patients all make assignment of the correct clinical phenotype challenging. This complexity has compelled a search for new, more effective methods for investigating the genetics of AF. One approach is to use the families of affected patients as an enriched target population for the deﬁnition and evaluation of intermediate or endophenotypes, such as prolonged signal-averaged P-wave duration (24), which are causally related to the poorly penetrant classic clinical syndromes

(25). Because of these limitations, researchers have begun to apply other approaches to identify genes that may be associated with AF. A logical consequence of the availability of comprehensive genomic maps is the advent of highdensity genome-wide searches for modest gene effects using large-scale testing of SNPs. This approach has identiﬁed common variants on the chromosome 4q25 locus and more recently common SNPs on chromosomes 16q22 (26) and 1q21 (27) that confer an increased risk (OR: 1.2 to 1.4) for AF across multiple different populations.
One of the most challenging problems with nonMendelian genetic approaches is the differentiation of signal from noise. Association studies may be confounded by etiologic heterogeneity, population stratiﬁcation, or falsepositives, while the bias toward small effects may miss major genetic contributions relevant only in a subset of study subjects. It may also prove difﬁcult to deﬁne the fundamental mechanisms of any true associations, because the responsible gene may be remotely linked to the locus identiﬁed. The development of more efﬁcient models for the rapid validation of genomewide association study results and improved understanding of the underlying biology will facilitate the interpretation of such studies. In our study, however, variants identiﬁed in our screening are likely to be causative, because we demonstrated cosegregation of the variants with AF in multiple kindreds (where available), the variants were absent in a large control population, and all novel variants are located in highly conserved regions of the ion channel and signaling protein. This supports a link between disturbed ion channel and protein function and AF.
Studies of kindreds with AF suggest a genetic basis for the condition, and mutations in several cardiac potassium channel genes have been linked to familial AF (28,29). Although speciﬁc mutations in the KCNQ1 gene have been observed in families with AF, the role of such mutations in AF remains unclear; often such isolated or “private” mutations are in residues of unknown function, effects on channel conductance are variable, and in most cases it may be difﬁcult to discriminate rare polymorphisms of no functional signiﬁcance from true mutations. However, the low prevalence of KCNQ1 mutations in large AF cohorts suggests that mutations in this gene are not a major cause of AF

(30,31). In AF313, multiple family members presented with early-onset lone AF, and our segregation analysis supports the novel KCNQ1 mutation as being causative for AF. Furthermore, the absence of the KCNQ1 variant (IAP54-56) in non–African-American control groups excludes the possibility that this mutation is a common polymorphism in this population; this ﬁnding is consistent with a diseaseassociated mutation. The KCNQ1–IAP54-56 variant, however, was identiﬁed in 2.1% of healthy African American subjects, suggesting that it may be a common risk allele in this population.
Several limitations of the present study warrant consideration. First, most of the AF kindreds were small, and therefore, formal segregation analysis was limited. Data for some unaffected family members were not available. Second, no novel mutations were identiﬁed in the ethnically deﬁned controls. However, comprehensive resequencing of the individual gene in the population-based controls was not performed, and this may condition interpretation of the results of this study. Although it is possible that additional novel ion channel and other gene mutations may have been identiﬁed, and our focused strategy of control genotyping may underestimate the true prevalence of rare polymorphisms, the association of the mutations with AF is supported primarily by segregation analysis and the fact that the mutations occurred in a highly conserved region of the protein. Third, population stratiﬁcation may confound our results, especially across families. However, because our

cohort came from a fairly homogenous population of individuals of European descent, we believe that this is unlikely to bias our results. Furthermore, data on the common 4q25 allele frequencies (as shown in Table 7) would suggest otherwise. Clinical implications. The idea that a combination of common and rare variants contributes to the very common phenotype of AF may have signiﬁcant impact on the assessment and management of patients not only with familial AF but also the more common forms of the arrhythmia. Our study has demonstrated that the penetrance of genes encoding rare ion channel and signaling proteins is modulated by common variants on chromosome 4q25, supporting the idea that AF inheritance is complex (i.e., a single genetic variant does not predict the phenotype). Currently there is no clinical role for genetic testing in most patients with AF (32). However, a case can be made to screen candidate AF genes in those patients who present with early-onset lone AF, especially if there is a strong family history of the arrhythmia. Identiﬁcation of a rare genetic variant in lone AF probands may be followed by consideration of screening family members to identify other carriers and also genotyping at the 4q25 AF locus. Identiﬁcation of family members who are at risk for developing AF is important, because therapies known to reduce the incidence of AF, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, could be considered.
Conclusions
We have shown that 2 common AF-associated polymorphisms can act as genetic modiﬁers of the clinical severity of familial AF. One interpretation of our ﬁndings is that in kindreds with familial AF, the arrhythmia develops in subjects who have the rare AF-associated variants as well as susceptibility alleles determined by the 4q25 locus. Our ﬁndings support the general concept that common variants may act as signiﬁcant modiﬁers of the effects of rare variants and that the genetic architecture of common human phenotypes includes both rare and common variants (33).
