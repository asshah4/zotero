Title:          -adrenergic receptor responsiveness in aging heart and clinical implications
Subject:        Elderly healthy individuals have a reduced exercise tolerance and a decreased left ventricle inotropic reserve related to increased vascular afterload, arterial-ventricular load mismatching, physical deconditioning and impaired autonomic regulation (the so called "-adrenergic desensitization").
Keywords:       -adrenergic receptors, -adrenoceptor desensitization, -adrenoceptor down-regulation, G-protein coupled receptor kinase, aging heart, failing heart, exercise
