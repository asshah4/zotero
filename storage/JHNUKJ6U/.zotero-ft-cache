Neurocardiology: a neurobiologist’s perspective

Pre- and postganglionic neurones of the autonomic nervous system are functionally differentiated according to their target tissues. Individual sympathetic pre- and postganglionic neurones can be activated or inhibited reﬂexly by appropriate physiological stimuli as has been shown in anaesthetized animals (mainly cats and rats) for neurones of the lumbar sympathetic outﬂow to skeletal muscle, skin and pelvic viscera and for neurones of the thoracic sympathetic outﬂow to the head and neck (Ja¨nig, 2006; Ja¨nig & McLachlan, 2013) and in humans for postganglionic neurones projecting in muscle or skin nerves (Ja¨nig & Ha¨bler, 2003; Wallin, 2013). The reﬂexes correspond to the effector responses that are induced by changes in activity of these neurones. The reﬂex patterns are characteristic and therefore represent the physiological ‘ﬁngerprints’ for each type of sympathetic pathway. They are the functional expression of the neural circuits in spinal cord, brain stem and hypothalamus connected to the peripheral sympathetic pathways. The same types of reﬂex patterns have been observed in both preganglionic and postganglionic neurones. The neurones in most of these pathways (e.g. the vasoconstrictor, sudomotor, motility-regulating pathways, and other pathways) have ongoing activity whereas the neurones in other pathways are normally silent in anaesthetized animals (e.g. pilomotor and vasodilator pathways, pathways to sexual organs). It is likely that other target cells are similarly innervated by functionally distinct groups of sympathetic neurones that have not been systematically studied so far. These include heart (pacemaker, myocytes, coronary arteries), kidney (blood vessels, juxtaglomerular cells, tubules), urogenital tract, hindgut, spleen, and brown and white adipose tissue (Verberne & Sartor, 2010; Morrison, 2011, 2013).

Several systematic studies have been made on the functional properties of parasympathetic pre- and postganglionic neurones. The principle of organization into functionally discrete pathways is likely to be the same as in the sympathetic nervous system, the main difference being that some targets of the sympathetic system are widely distributed throughout the body (e.g. blood vessels, sweat glands, erector pili muscles, fat tissue) whereas the targets of the parasympathetic pathways are more restricted (Ja¨nig, 2006; Ja¨nig & McLachlan, 2013). The centrally generated signals are faithfully transmitted from the preganglionic neurones to the postganglionic neurones in the autonomic ganglia and from the postganglionic neurones to the effector tissues at the neuroeffector junctions or at the sites where the varicosities of the postganglionic axons are in close proximity with the tissue (e.g. non-excitable tissues). This signal transmission is function-speciﬁc and the basis for the precise regulation of autonomic effector tissues by the brain. A few effector tissues also contain intrinsic neuronal networks that include the components for reﬂex control within the periphery. The most prominent is the enteric nervous system, which contains afferent neurones, interneurones and motoneurones that regulate various target tissues (smooth musculature, secretory epithelia, endocrine cells) and even modulate postganglionic sympathetic neurones in prevertebral ganglia. The preganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways regulate the activity of these intrinsic pathways in an integrative manner to determine organ function. Some peripheral afferents from the visceral organs project as far as prevertebral sympathetic ganglia and amplify postganglionic activity (e.g. Szurszewski, 1981; Ja¨nig & McLachlan, 1987; McLachlan & Meckler, 1989). Peripheral neuronal reﬂex systems have been identiﬁed in the heart and pancreas, and possibly other organs. However, other than the important control of peristalsis and secretion in the gut (Furness, 2006; Furness et al. 2014), the operation of these peripheral reﬂex pathways in determining organ function remains largely unknown and needs further investigation.

The conclusions to be drawn from these neurophysiological studies are important for the discussion of the neural regulation of the heart (Ja¨nig, 2006; Ja¨nig & McLachlan, 2013):
(1) The peripheral autonomic (parasympathetic and sympathetic) systems consist of several separate neuronal channels transmitting the central messages to the autonomic target tissues. This conclusion is supported by morphological studies using tracers and by studies of neuropeptides co-localized in postganglionic and preganglionic neurones with the classical transmitters acetylcholine or noradrenaline (Gibbins, 1995, 2004). Peripheral circuits may also modulate the central activity patterns related to some visceral organs.
(2) The distinct reﬂex patterns generated in autonomic neurones by physiological stimulation of afferent neurones innervating visceral, skin or deep somatic tissues indicate that each autonomic pathway is connected to speciﬁc neural circuits in spinal cord, brain stem and hypothalamus that are involved in autonomic regulation.
(3) We have some knowledge about the central circuits involved in cardiovascular regulation and thermoregulation. However, the central circuits, including the spinal ones, are largely unknown for most peripheral ﬁnal autonomic pathways (see Ja¨nig, 2006; Llewellyn-Smith & Verberne, 2011; Paton & Spyer, 2013).
The brain–heart axis
The brain–heart axis is involved in the neural regulation of the heart via the autonomic cardiomotor (CM) pathways. This axis was already present in vertebrates some 500 million years ago in elasmobranch and teleost ﬁshes. The heart of elasmobranchs is under parasympathetic (vagal) CM control and the heart of teleosts under both parasympathetic and sympathetic CM control (Nilsson, 2011; Ja¨nig, 2013). This shows that the regulation of the heart by the brain is phylogenetically old, as is the case for the foregut, but probably went through various changes in the central and peripheral nervous system, although

the basic principles of the organization of the peripheral CM pathways remained the same throughout the vertebrate kingdom (transmitters and their receptors, excitatory effects, inhibitory effects, etc.). This shows that the brain–heart axis is biologically rather important. However, our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the functioning of this axis under biological conditions remains still amazingly poor in view of the fact that the pathophysiology of the neural regulation of the heart and its consequences for therapy has a high representation in medicine. Knowledge about these peripheral and central mechanisms is the gate to understanding the pathophysiology underlying various diseases related to the heart in humans (Floras, 2012; Golombek, 2012; Robertson & Sato, 2012; Bajpai & Camm, 2013; Francis & Cohn, 2013; Hainsworth & Claydon, 2013; Samuels,

2013). Thus, research in neurocardiology should primarily focus on the neurobiology of the regulation of the heart, covering the ﬁeld from neuroeffector transmission to telencephalic control of the heart. Here I will discuss research questions related to the brain–heart axis. This discussion is based on my personal opinion and does not imply any priority of the type of basic research involved and of the level of integration at which the neural control of the heart occurs. However, it should be kept in mind that the ‘neural machineries’ of the peripheral CM pathways (neuroeffector transmission, transmission and integration of impulse activity in cardiac and possibly stellate ganglia) are fully integrated in the central integrative processes, so that the peripheral neural machineries are ‘used’ by the brain as tools to regulate the functioning of the heart.

Neuroeffector transmission (1 in Fig. 1)
To unravel the transmission of the neural signals in the postganglionic cardiomotor (CM) neurones to the effector cells (cells of the sinoatrial node (SAN) and the atrioventricular node (AVN), myocytes, coronary vascular cells) is of utmost importance. This transmission of neural signals occurs at rather small areas of the surface of the target cell syncytia (<0.5%). The idea that exogenous application of transmitter (acetylcholine, noradrenaline, neuropeptides) to a preparation (e.g. blood vessels, heart) mimics the effect of neurally released transmitter is a misconception. Therefore, it is not far-fetched to assume that the intracellular pathways connecting junctional and extrajunctional membrane receptors for acetylcholine or noradrenaline with the cellular effector mechanisms

(ionic channels, contractile machinery) are different for the two groups of receptors. The function(s) of the extrajunctional receptors under physiological conditions is (are) largely unclear. However, this may radically change under pathophysiological conditions, as far as the functions of the extrajunctional receptors are concerned (Ja¨nig, 2011). The experimental work of Hirst and co-workers (Bywater et al. 1989, 1990; Campbell et al. 1989; Bramich et al. 1990; Klemm et al. 1992; Choate et al. 1993; Edwards et al. 1993, 1995; Hirst et al. 1991, 1996) and others has to be reproduced and extended. Clariﬁcation of the neurobiology will lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology (e.g. after myocardial infarction (Rajendran et al. 2016), atrial and ventricular ﬁbrillation, myocardial ischaemia, sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia, in diabetic neuropathy) and to new mechanism-based therapeutical strategies. Neurobiological research (e.g. in vitro experimentation as well as quasi in vivo experimentation using the working heart–brain stem preparation (Paton, 1996) and associated techniques) should concentrate on the following topics:

r Neuroeffector transmission to the

SAN cell syncytium (parasympathetic,

sympathetic) and to cardiac myocytes

r

(sympathetic). Role of junctional and extrajunctional

cholinergic muscarinic receptors and

adrenoreceptors and their connections

via intracellular pathways to the cellular effectors (Ca2+, Na+, K+ channels,

r

contractile mechanism). Role of neuropeptides

and

their

receptors in neuroeffector transmission

r

to the heart. Postganglionic

parasympathetic

CM

neurones do not only innervate atria,

SAN and AVN but also the ventricles.

The parasympathetic innervation

of the cardiac ventricles may act on

the myocytes either directly or via

the sympathetic innervation or via

interaction with neurones of the

intrinsic cardiac plexus (Coote, 2013).

How dense is this parasympathetic

innervation of the ventricles compared

to the atria? Quantitative immune

histochemical studies of atria and

ventricles have to be done on the same

sections using tyrosine hydroxylase

(as a noradrenergic marker) and

vesicular acetylcholine transporter (as

r

a cholinergic marker). The long-held story

about

the

physiological interaction between

sympathetic postganglionic CM axons

and parasympathetic postganglionic

CM axons, based on pharmacological

investigations, is largely open and

unclear (Levy, 1984; Manabe et al.

1991). This interaction involves acetyl-

choline and prejunctional muscarinic

receptors in sympathetic terminals

and possibly neuropeptides. A better

understanding of such interactions

could provide novel targets for

treatment in postinfarct ventricular

tachycardia, such as pharmacological

stimulation of the parasympathetic

axons (Coote, 2013).

Transmission of activity in cardiac ganglia (2 in Fig. 1)

The cardiac ganglia have not been studied extensively, the main reason being that these studies are technically demanding. It is silently assumed [with some exceptions, Edwards et al. 1995; Armour, 2008; Ardell et al. 2016 (in this issue)] that transmission of activity through these ganglia follows the simple rules of relay and distribution of activity. However, this may not be true.

r What are the functions of 60% of
neurones in parasympathetic ganglia that cannot be activated by preganglionic CM neurones and are suspected to be local afferent neurones or local motoneurones without preganglionic synaptic input (based on in vivo and in vitro experimentation and on experiments using the working heart–brain stem preparation (WHBP); Edwards et al. 1995; Ja¨nig, 2006, 2011; McAllen et al. 2011)? Are these neurones functionally unimportant under normal conditions but play a role in the preganglionically denervated heart? Based on the available data, we plainly cannot know whether integrative processes in the parasympathetic ganglia are important under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Would activity in the parasympathetic ganglia be expected to counter-regulate the inﬂuence of sympathetic nerves on the injured heart? Could a dysregulation in parasympathetic ganglia play a role in the detrimental effect of sympathetic

excitation on the injured heart (Ardell

et al. 2016; Rajendran et al. 2016)?

One postganglionic parasympathetic

CM neurone is innervated and

driven by one strong preganglionic

parasympathetic input. Can this safe

synaptic transmission be modulated

by intraganglionic synaptic inputs

r

(McAllen et al. 2011)? What is the nature

of

synaptic

transmission from sympathetic

preganglionic CM neurones to

sympathetic postganglionic CM

neurones in the stellate ganglion and

in the superior cervical ganglion? The

activity of the postganglionic CM

neurones seem to be dominated by

one or a few strong synaptic inputs (E.

M. McLachlan & L. V. Melnitchenko,

unpublished observations) as is the

case in ganglia of the sympathetic chain

(Lichtman et al. 1980; McLachlan et al.

1997, 1998; Bratton et al. 2010).

In the stellate ganglion cardiac and

non-cardiac neurones are not different

in morphology or electrophysiological

r

properties (Mo et al. 1994). How are synaptic connectivity

and

strength within cardiac ganglia set

and adjusted under physiological

and pathophysiological situations

(Rajendran et al. 2016)? What is the

feedback that is used in this process,

and where and how is this feedback

r

registered? What is the

nature

of

putative

local

afferent neurones or interneurones in

the stellate ganglion? It is important

to show whether integration based on

local excitatory neurones principally

exists (Bosnjak & Kampine, 1982,

1989), whether it is functionally

important during normal neural

regulation of the heart, or whether it

is some sort of developmental left-over.

Do peptidergic spinal afferent neuro-

nes innervating the heart form synapses

by collaterals with sympathetic post-

ganglionic neurones innervating the

heart? Under which physiological

or pathophysiological conditions is

this peptidergic synaptic transmission

r

functioning? Which data

support

the

interesting

concept of the ‘intrinsic cardiac

nervous system’ (ICNS) (‘little brain

of the heart’) as propagated by

Armour and co-workers (Armour,

2008; Beaumont et al. 2013; Rajendran

et al. 2016; Ardell et al. 2016) and

others? Is the ICNS functioning in a

similar manner to the enteric nervous

system (ENS) (Furness, 2006; Furness

et al. 2014)? Is there evidence for

intrinsic reﬂexes mediated by the ICNS

in analogy to the ENS? Do intrinsic

afferent neurones form peripheral feed-

back loops with postganglionic cardio-

r

motor neurones? Clinical and experimental

evidence

suggest that neurones of the ICNS

undergo plastic changes (described

by the concept of ‘structural and

functional remodelling’) under

pathophysiological

conditions

(Rajendran et al. 2016). Changes of the

cardiac target tissue of the cardiomotor

neurones under pathophysiological

conditions may lead to plastic changes

of the autonomic innervation of the

heart. Thus, the intrinsic afferent, the

intrinsic efferent and the preganglionic

neurones may start to sprout and form

new synapses (Kepper & Keast, 1998;

Keast, 2004).

Sympathetic preganglionic CM neurones, spinal afferent feedback and spinal integration (3 in Fig. 1)

Do functionally separate sympathetic CM pathways exist, e.g. to the SAN or AVN and to the myocytes? Is the sympathetic pathway to the coronary arteries (cardiovasoconstrictor neurones) separate from the sympathetic pathway(s) to the SAN, AVN or myocytes? If functionally separate sympathetic pathways to the heart do exist this should be reﬂected in functionally characteristic discharge patterns as functional markers for different populations of sympathetic neurones supplying the heart (Ja¨nig, 2006; Ja¨nig & McLachlan, 2013). This neurophysiological work should be combined with morphological work (intracellular labelling of functionally identiﬁed postganglionic neurones with reconstruction of their dendrites and axons). Intracellular recording from postganglionic neurones using the WHBP with attached spinal cord (McAllen et al. 2011) and in vitro experimentation using the SAN and other parts of the heart with attached nerves should be done.

Which sympathetic neuronal subtype

mediates the detrimental effects on the heart

in pathophysiological conditions such as

atrial or ventricular ﬁbrillation, myocardial

ischaemia, myocardial infarction, sudden

cardiac death and the like? Is it possible

that the changes in the coronary innervation

regulating blood ﬂow is important in these

pathological conditions?

The heart is innervated by spinal visceral

afferent neurones which are involved in

cardiac nociception and pain as well

in the regulation of cardiac output

during body exercise. It is hypothesized

that sympathetic cardiomotor neurones,

spinal visceral afferent cardiac neuro-

nes and spinal cord circuits, including

excitatory and inhibitory interneurones,

form cardio-cardiac reﬂexes. These reﬂex

circuits are normally involved in adaptation

of cardiac output during exercise but

may form, under pathophysiologically

deleterious conditions, a positive feed-

back loop with the heart. Which types

of sympathetic CM neurones are involved

in these reﬂexes? Which classes of spinal

interneurones are involved (Deuchars,

2011)?

r Muscle vasoconstrictor neurones are

inhibited by stimulation of muscle

nociceptors of the same extremity

but not by stimulation of cutaneous

nociceptors. Cutaneous vasoconst-

rictor neurones are inhibited by

stimulation of cutaneous nociceptors

of the same extremity but not by

stimulation of muscle nociceptors

(Kirillova-Woytke et al. 2014). These

protective inhibitory nociceptive

reﬂexes are most likely organized at

the level of the spinal cord and under

powerful supraspinal control. Do

these types of protective nociceptive

reﬂexes exist for the heart (e.g.

in the vasoconstrictor neurones

innervating the coronary blood

r

vessels)? What are

the

functions

and

under-

lying mechanisms of the descending

control of spinal cardiac circuits

involving brain stem, hypothalamus

and telencephalon? This important

question should also be studied in

humans using brain imaging of grey

and white matter changes under

resting state activity and under cardiac

load.

J Physiol 594.14

r What are the mechanisms underlying

the referral of cardiac diseases (e.g.

coronary disease) to deep somatic

tissues (myotomes, sclerotomes),

superﬁcial somatic tissues (skin,

subcutaneous zone, dermatomes) and

other visceral organs (oesophagus,

upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT),

airways) involving spinal circuits and

their supraspinal control (King et al.

r

2011)? Can functional

cardiac

diseases

be

diagnosed by manual palpation (and

other procedures) of the deep somatic

and superﬁcial referred zone of

the heart and discriminated from

functional diseases of other visceral

organs innervated by the same spinal

(thoracic) segments (e.g. lungs and

airways, lower oesophagus, stomach

and duodenum, pancreas and liver) as

propagated in the ﬁeld of osteopathic

medicine (Cox et al. 1983; Beal,

1985; Nicholas et al. 1985)? Brain

imaging approaches should be used to

identify abnormal central processing

in functional heart diseases. Data

obtained in this way should be

correlated with quantitative data

describing the changes in the referred

body zones (changes of blood ﬂow,

sweating, tissue consistency (trophic

r

changes)) (Ja¨nig et al. 2015). Can functional diseases of the

heart

be treated by manual interventions

and other interventions in the referred

superﬁcial and deep somatic zone of

the heart as propagated in osteopathic

medicine and other subdisciplines

of manual medicine? This idea is

based on the concept (philosophy)

that there exist special somato-visceral

and viscero-somatic neural relations

between visceral organs and somatic

tissues (deep somatic, body surface)

involving spinal circuits and their

control by supraspinal centres (Ja¨nig,

r

2006; King et al. 2011). What are the interactions

between

different visceral organs (heart, lungs,

airways, GIT) via the spinal circuits,

leading to referred viscero-visceral

hyperalgesia and referred functional

changes involving spinal circuits,

sympathetic outﬂows and afferent feed-

back (Giamberardino et al. 2010; Ja¨nig,

2010)?

These preganglionic neurones are

normally silent or exhibit irregular

non-respiration-related discharges.

They appear to be unaffected by

stimulation of arterial baro- or

chemoreceptors (Jones, 2001). Recent

experiments on rats demonstrate that

these preganglionic neurones may be

involved in the ventricular excitability

via a nitrergic mechanism (Machhada

et al. 2015). However, evidence that

these parasympathetic neurones

innervate the cardiac ventricles is

r

lacking (but see Coote, 2013). What is the evidence for

para-

sympathetic vasodilator neurones

supplying the coronary arteries of the

heart? Investigation of the vasculature

of the rat heart using immuno-

histochemical techniques shows a

much denser innervation of atrial

than ventricular coronary arteries by

noradrenergic and cholinergic efferent

nerve ﬁbres, whereas nitrergic ﬁbres

are sparse. Peptidergic sensory nerve

ﬁbres are uniformly distributed to

atrial and ventricular vessels (Scha¨fer

r

et al. 1998; Sequeira et al. 2005). How do reﬂex arcs in the lower brain

stem connect to parasympathetic CM

pathways, to preganglionic neurones

innervating airways (Canning, 2011),

to preganglionic neurones innervating

the proximal GIT (including liver;

Ja¨nig, 2006; Travagli et al. 2006) inter-

act? These reﬂex arcs include the

second-order neurones in the nucleus

of the solitary tract (NTS), the nucleus

ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus

of the vagus, and their multiple

supramedullary controls (Ja¨nig, 2006;

and are closely associated with the respiratory ponto-medullary network (Spyer & Gourine, 2009; Guyenet, 2014; Guyenet & Bayliss, 2015).

Cardio-respiratory integration and its control (4 in Fig. 1)

Neural regulation of the cardiovascular

system (blood vessels, heart) and of

respiration are closely integrated in the

lower brain stem (pons, medulla oblongata)

(Ja¨nig, 2006; Guyenet, 2011; Paton &

Pickering, 2012).

r Knowledge of neural cardio-respi-

ratory integration is still in its

infancy. Unravelling this integration

in the lower brain stem (medulla

oblongata and pons) is essential for

understanding the neural regulation

of both systems under various

functional conditions (Dampney,

1994; Ja¨nig, 2006; Spyer & Gourine,

2009; Guyenet, 2011, 2014) and may

give us a better lead to the so-called

cardioprotective effects of the activity

in parasympathetic cardiomotor

r

neurones. What are the

mechanisms

underlying

the integration between the respiratory

neural network and the preganglionic

CM neurones (Ja¨nig, 2006; Paton &

r

Pickering, 2012)? How are the reﬂex

circuits

related

to parasympathetic CM neurones

(baroreceptor reﬂexes, peripheral

chemoreceptor reﬂexes, central

chemoreceptor reﬂexes, trigeminal

reﬂexes, nociceptor reﬂexes, other)

and the respiratory network integrated

under various functional conditions

(e.g. diving, exercise, mental activity)

(Guyenet, 2011, 2014; Paton & Spyer,

2013)? Are these reﬂex circuits affected

r

by cardiac pathology? Neuroanatomical

and

neuro-

physiological experiments show

that centres in the lower brain stem

that are involved in cardiovascular

regulation, such as the NTS, the

rostral ventrolateral medulla and the

caudal ventrolateral medulla, are also

inﬂuenced by the vestibular system

(in particular the vestibular otolith

organs). This inﬂuence serves to adjust

arterial blood pressure and organ

blood ﬂow during movement and

changes in posture (Yates et al. 2014).

Mechanisms underlying the regulation

of the heart via parasympathetic and

sympathetic CM neurones during these

r

adjustments are almost unknown. Regulation of heart, blood ﬂow through

resistance vessels of skeletal muscle and

viscera, and blood ﬂow through skin

are under powerful cortical control,

as shown during diving, exercise and

other behavioural conditions (Elsner

et al. 1966; Goodwin et al. 1972;

Casson & Ronald, 1975; Gandevia et al.

1993). Where in the ponto-medullary

cardio-vascular-respiratory network

do the cortical command signals inter-

fere to adjust the cardiovascular system

during these behaviours? Knowing the

neural mechanisms underlying this

coupling would give us a better lead to

the neural control of the heart by the

forebrain under pathophysiological

conditions.

Heart, interoception and emotions (5 in Fig. 1)

In humans and higher vertebrates, expression of emotions signals the state of behaviour to conspeciﬁcs, being involved in the regulation of social behaviour, whereas the feeling of emotions is involved in internal signalling and regulation of their own behaviour. The generation and modulation of the emotions are believed to be dependent on the state of the body tissues, in particular visceral organs and deep somatic tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle), and therefore on the functions and on the spatio-temporal patterns of the activity in the afferent feedback from these body tissues to their central representations. The afferent neurones have small-diameter myelinated or unmyelinated axons and encode in their activity the mechanical, thermal, metabolic and inﬂammatory states of the body tissues. They project to lamina I of the spinal or trigeminal dorsal horn (spinal/trigeminal afferent neurones, Craig, 2003b) or to the NTS (vagal afferent neurones). Both lamina I and NTS are the interoceptive interface between body tissues and brain. Their tract neurones project, in addition to various nuclei in brain stem and hypothalamus, via speciﬁc thalamic nuclei (the posterior part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMpo) for the lamina I tract neurones and the basal part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMb) for the tract neurones in the NTS) to the dorsal posterior

insular cortex. This cortex is according to Craig the primary interoceptive cortex or limbic sensory cortex (Craig, 2003a,b, 2015, 2016). Activity in these afferent feedback systems is also or mainly dependent on the activity in the efferent (autonomic, somatomotor) systems innervating the body tissues. Thus, efferent systems, body tissues and afferent interoceptive feedback form body loops which are hypothesized to be essential in the development (after birth), generation, maintenance and modulation of emotional expression as well as emotional feelings (James, 1884; Damasio, 1999, 2003). What is fact and what ﬁction? The heart is traditionally believed to play an important role in body interoception [see Shivkumar et al. 2016 (in this issue)] as well as in the generation or shaping of emotions. The efferent limbs of the body loop involving the heart are formed by the parasympathetic and sympathetic cardiomotor neurones. The afferent limbs are formed by arterial baroreceptor afferent neurones and cardiac vagal afferent neurones, both projecting to the NTS, as well as spinal cardiac afferent neurones projecting to the dorsal horn of the thoracic spinal cord.

r How important is the efferent–afferent

body loop involving the heart to

shape and/or generate emotional

feelings in comparison to potential

loops involving other visceral organs

or somatic tissue (e.g. gastro-

intestinal tract, pelvic organs, skeletal

musculature)? This question should

be explored carefully using imaging

methods focusing on spinal cord, brain

stem and forebrain combined with

psychophysics and other methods.

After all it should be kept in mind

(1) that the afferent feedback from

different tissues is functionally

different, (2) that the peripheral

target tissues are innervated by many

functionally different peripheral auto-

nomic pathways, which is reﬂected

in the distinct discharge patterns of

their neurones, and dependent on

the distinct central organization of

the autonomic systems, and (3) that

the activity in the afferent feedback

is also or mainly dependent on the

activity in the peripheral autonomic

r

pathways. Various cortical

and

subcortical

areas

of the forebrain (e.g. insular cortex,

Editorial

anterior cingulate cortex, medial and

ventral prefrontal cortex, amygdala)

are involved, via autonomic ‘centres’

in hypothalamus and brain stem, in

autonomic regulation of the heart and

in the processing of the afferent feed-

back from the heart. What are the

mechanisms underlying this forebrain

r

control? Experimental work addressing the role

of the heart in shaping and generating

emotions will be conducted on the basis

of the James–Lange–Damasio theory

of emotions (James, 1884; Damasio,

1999, 2003). This theory suggests that

the efferent–afferent body loop via the

heart, as well as the corresponding

centrally organized ‘as if’ loop that is

vicarious for the real body loop, to

the central representations of the body

tissues (Damasio, 1996) are essential

to generate emotional feelings. Based

on their experimental investigations

of various groups of human sub-

jects Ekman and co-workers have

shown that the basic emotions are

characterized by distinct autonomic

patterns (expressed as change in heart

rate, change in skin conductance,

change in skin temperature). Thus,

subjective emotional feelings,

expression of emotions mediated

by the somatomotor system (facial

expression) and activation of auto-

nomic systems are highly correlated.

They conclude that ‘there is an innate

affect program for each emotion that

once activated directs for each emotion

changes in the organism’s biological

state by providing instructions to

multiple response systems, including

facial skeletal muscles, other skeletal

muscles and autonomic nervous

system [to various effectors, one being

the heart]’ (Levenson et al. 1990, 1991;

r

Ekman, 1992). Research on

the

autonomic

body

loop (real and ‘as if’) in human

subjects should be performed

using modern imaging techniques

combined with measurements of

autonomic parameters, psychophysical

parameters, etc. Independent of the

biological importance of this basic

research (we learn who we are), this

experimental approach will suggest

leads to various functional diseases

of the heart (e.g. related to the effect

of bodily and psychological stress on

the heart). Therefore experimental

J Physiol 594.14
work on this topic should have a high priority (Emani & Binkley, 2010; Taggart et al. 2011; Garﬁnkel & Critchley, 2016).
