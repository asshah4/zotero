Abstract

Objective: We proposed and tested a novel electrocardiogram marker of risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Methods: Digital orthogonal electrocardiograms were recorded at rest before implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in 508 participants of a primary prevention ICDs prospective cohort study (mean ± SD age, 60 ± 12 years; 377 male [74%]). The sum magnitude of the absolute QRST integral in 3 orthogonal leads (SAI QRST) was calculated. A derivation cohort of 128 patients was used to define a cutoff; a validation cohort (n = 380) was used to test a predictive value. Results: During a mean follow-up of 18 months, 58 patients received appropriate ICD therapies. The SAI QRST was lower in patients with VA (105.2 ± 60.1 vs 138.4 ± 85.7 mV ⁎ ms, P = .002). In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, patients with SAI QRST not exceeding 145 mV ⁎ ms had about 4-fold higher risk of VA (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.96-6.71; P b .0001) and a 6fold higher risk of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (hazard ratio, 6.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-29.69; P = .014), whereas prediction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: High SAI QRST is associated with low risk of sustained VA in patients with structural heart disease. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) strikes about 350 000 victims in the United States every year.1 Implantable cardioverterdefibrillators (ICDs) are the treatment of choice2-4 for patients at risk for SCD. The need to extend risk stratification beyond use of ejection fraction (EF) is well recognized.5,6 A U-shaped curve for ICD benefit was shown in the analysis of the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II,5 prompting a search for markers that identify low-risk patients who do not benefit from ICD implantation.

During the century of electrocardiography, multiple
attempts were made to decipher complex information
carried by cardiac electrical signal to obtain important
clinical diagnostic and prognostic information. Several
approaches have been proposed to develop composite
electrocardiogram (ECG) metrics that account for both
amplitude and duration of ECG waveforms, with the goal to diagnose hypertrophy,7,8 to determine localization and size of the scar,9-11 and to assess heterogeneity of action potential.12 Although modern imaging modalities question
utility of diagnostic ECG, prognostic ECG markers remain
of interest. Arrhythmogenic substrate in patients susceptible
to ventricular arrhythmia (VA) with structural heart disease
is characterized by specific electrophysiologic properties of
a scar, cardiac hypertrophy, and dilatation, resulting in the conditions of source-sink mismatch13,14 and dispersion of refractoriness.15-17

In this work, we proposed a novel ECG metric: sum magnitude of the absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST). We hypothesized that the SAI QRST predicts VA in primary prevention ICD patients with structural heart disease.

Methods
The study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins University institutional review board, and all patients gave written informed consent before entering the study.
Study population
Prospective Observational Study of the ICD in Sudden Cardiac Death Prevention (PROSE-ICD) (NCT00733590) is a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study of primary prevention ICD patients with either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Patients were eligible for the study if the left ventricular (LV) EF was less than or equal to 35%, myocardial infarction was at least 4 weeks old, or nonischemic LV dysfunction was present for at least 9 months. Patients were excluded if the ICD was indicated for secondary prevention of SCD, if patient had a permanent pacemaker or a class I indication for pacing, if the patient had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV, or if the patient was pregnant. Electrophysiologic testing to assess inducibility of ventricular tachycardia (VT) was performed in 373 patients (73%) at the time of ICD implantation. Left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDD) was assessed by 2dimensional echocardiography in 225 patients (44.3%). Single-chamber ICD was implanted in 263 patients (52%), dual-chamber ICD in 92 patients (18%), and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) in 153 patients (30%). The PROSE-ICD study is an ongoing active project that continues to enroll new patients. This report presents data analysis of study participants with at least 6 months of follow-up, recruited at the Johns Hopkins Hospital site.
Surface ECG recording
Digital orthogonal ECG was recorded before ICD implantation during 5 minutes at rest, using the modified Frank18 orthogonal XYZ leads by PC ECG machine (Norav Medical Ltd, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada), with a 1000-Hz sampling frequency, high-pass filter 0.05 Hz, low-pass filter 350 Hz, and notch filter 60 Hz.
QRST integral measurement
All ECGs were analyzed by customized software in a robust automated fashion. Noise and ventricular premature and ventricular-paced beats were excluded from analysis, but ECG recordings during atrial fibrillation were analyzed. Images of areas under the QRST curve were reviewed to ensure appropriate ECG wave detection. Absolute QRST integral was measured as the arithmetic sum of areas under the QRST curve (absolute area under the QRST curve above baseline was added to the area below baseline; Fig. 1), averaged during a 5-minute epoch. The sum magnitude of 3

orthogonal leads absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) was calculated.
End points
Appropriate ICD therapies (either shock or antitachycardia pacing) for VA served as the primary end point for analysis. Programming of the ICD was based on the attending electrophysiologist's clinical evaluation. The ICD device was interrogated during follow-up visits every 6 months. All ICD interrogation data were reviewed by an independent end points adjudication committee blinded to the results of SAI QRST analysis. Implantable cardioverterdefibrillator therapies for monomorphic VT (MMVT), polymorphic VT (PVT), or ventricular fibrillation (VF) were classified as appropriate. Monomorphic VT was defined as a sustained VT with stable cycle length (CL) and electrogram morphology. Polymorphic VT was defined as a sustained VT with unstable CL and electrogram morphology and average CL of at least 200 milliseconds. Ventricular fibrillation was defined as sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia with unstable CL and electrogram morphology and average CL less than 200 milliseconds. Sustained appropriately treated VT/VF events were categorized as MMVT group and PVT/VF group.
Statistical analysis
The first 128 consecutive participants of the PROSE-ICD study were included in the derivation cohort. The validation cohort included the remaining 380 PROSE-ICD study participants who were followed prospectively for at least 6 months.
Derivation data set analysis Cutoff points of SAI QRST were determined in the
preliminary analysis of 128 study patients, 15 of whom had sustained VT/VF events during 13 ± 10 months of follow-up. In this derivation set, the lowest SAI QRST quartile was less than or equal to 69 mV ⁎ ms; and the highest quartile was greater than 145 mV ⁎ ms. Preliminary survival analysis of the derivation set showed that the lowest quartile of the SAI QRST predicted VT/VF (log-rank test, P b .0001) with 100% sensitivity, 78% specificity, 37% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value.
Validation data set analysis Validation cohort participants were categorized according
to their baseline SAI QRST value, with SAI QRST less than or equal to 69 mV ⁎ ms labeled low, SAI QRST of 70 to

145 mV ⁎ ms labeled intermediate, and SAI QRST greater than 145 mV ⁎ ms labeled high. Linear regression analysis was used to study what physiologic parameters correlate with the SAI QRST. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare among 3 groups of SAI QRST, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Unadjusted and adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for subjects with low, intermediate, or high SAI QRST. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) statistic was computed to test the equality of survival distributions. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. An interaction between SAI QRST and bundlebranch block (BBB) status, as well as between SAI QRST and LVDD, was tested in the Cox model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of SAI QRST for freedom from VT/VF were calculated. STATA 10 software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) was used for calculations.

Results
Patient population
Clinical characteristics of the derivation and validation cohort patients are outlined in Table 1. There were no statistically significant differences between baseline characteristics of the 2 cohorts. Neither did the rate of VT/VF events differ significantly (15 patients [11.7%] in derivation cohort vs 43 patients [11.3%] in validation cohort experienced VT/VF; P = .901). A few differences in patient management were observed: derivation cohort patients were more frequently on β-blockers and statins, with a slightly higher rate of revascularization procedures.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up
During a mean (SD) follow-up of 18.0 (16.5) months, 43 (11.3%; or 7.5% per person-year of follow-up) of the 380 validation cohort patients experienced sustained VA and received appropriate ICD therapies. Monomorphic VT with an average (SD) CL of 293 (38) milliseconds was present in 31 patients (72%). Polymorphic VT/VF with an average (SD) CL of 214 (18) milliseconds was documented in 12 patients (3.2%; or 2.1% per person-year of follow-up). There were significantly fewer patients on β-blockers among those patients receiving subsequent appropriate ICD therapies (Table 2).
Predictive value of SAI QRST in validation cohort
Representative examples of baseline SAI QRST ECG in a patient with and one without subsequent sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and appropriate ICD therapy at followup are shown in Fig. 2. The SAI QRST was significantly lower in patients with sustained VA during follow-up (Wilcoxon rank sum test P = .004 and Student t test P = .002; Fig. 3). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the SAI QRST was significantly predictive for freedom from VT/VF during follow-up (Fig. 4A).
In the univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, patients with high SAI QRST had a 41% decrease in risk of VA compared with patients with intermediate SAI QRST; and accordingly, patients with intermediate SAI QRST had a 41% decrease in risk of VA compared with patients with low SAI QRST (hazard ratio [HR] for variable “low-intermediate-high SAI QRST,” 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.89; P = .012). The SAI QRST predicts MMVT (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-0.99; P = .049), rather than PVT/VF (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.40-1.06; P = .085). Importantly, the risk of VA in patients with low or intermediate SAI QRST was 4-fold higher than in patients with high SAI QRST (HR,

Low, intermediate, and high SAI QRST
Characteristics of the patients with low, intermediate, and high SAI QRST are presented in Table 3. There were more nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients with low LVEF and, at the same time, more patients with BBB and implanted CRT-D device among the high SAI QRST group. Patients with low SAI QRST had higher body mass index and were more frequently diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Several parameters were statistically significantly correlated with the SAI QRST: age (r = 0.115, P = .010), LVDD (r = 0.138, P = .009; Fig. 5A), EF (r = −0.162, P = .0001; Fig. 5B), body mass index (r = −0.102, P = .024; Fig. 5C), duration of the QT interval (r = 0.274, P b .0001; Fig. 5D), heart rate (r = −0.101, P = .022; Fig. 5E), beat-to-beat QT

variability index19 (r = −0.176, P b .0001), and QRS width (r = 0.634, P b .0001; Fig. 5F). The SAI QRST was significantly higher in patients with either left or right complete BBB (212.5 ± 100.8 vs 109.4 ± 56.62, P b .00001), and it was diminished in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (121.86 ± 67.48 vs 150.45 ± 96.52, P = .0002).
Multivariate survival analysis in validation cohort
Among other clinical and ECG parameters, use of β-blockers, implanted CRT-D device, and LVDD greater than 6 cm were significant in the univariate Cox regression for prediction of VA. Neither QT nor QRS duration predicted VT/VF events. Ejection fraction with cutoffs of 20%, 25%, and 30% was not associated with the risk of VA.

No significant interaction was found between SAI QRST and presence of BBB, or between SAI QRST and LVDD. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis for VT/VF events, high SAI QRST remained a significant predictor of freedom from VT/VF after adjustment20 for the use of β-blockers, implanted CRT-D, LVDD, and LVEF. The most complete multivariate Cox regression model for VT/VF prediction is shown in Table 4. Use of β-blockers and LVDD greater than 6 cm remained significant predictors in the multivariate model, too.
The ROC curve measuring the accuracy of the SAI QRST for freedom from VT/VF showed an AUC of 0.628 (95% CI, 0.538-0.717; Fig. 6A). An SAI QRST less than or equal to 145 mV ⁎ ms demonstrated 79% sensitivity, 65% specificity, 14% positive predictive value, and 93% negative predictive value for prediction of VA during 1.5 years of follow-up.

Discussion
In this study, we present a new marker of low risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and show that SAI QRST greater than 145 mV ⁎ ms is associated with a low risk of arrhythmia in structural heart disease patients with implanted ICD for primary prevention of SCD.

SAI QRST and QRS width
No significant interaction was found between SAI QRST and the presence of BBB in the multivariate Cox regression model. This outcome means that the SAI QRST predicts VT/VF in patients with and those without BBB. However, SAI QRST was significantly larger in patients with either left or right complete BBB (212.51 ± 100.8 vs 109.35 ± 56.62, P b .00001). Therefore, we suggest that the best cutoff value of SAI QRST should be different for patients with wide vs narrow QRS. For the purpose of this analysis, we combined derivation and validation cohorts and categorized all 508 study patients as part of either the narrow QRS subgroup (QRS ≤120 milliseconds, n = 272 [53.5%]) or the wide QRS subgroup (QRS N120 milliseconds, n = 236 [46.5%]). To define the best SAI QRST cutoff value, ROC curves were constructed separately in patients with narrow and patients with wide QRS (Fig. 6B, C). In patients with narrow QRS less than or equal to 120 milliseconds, the SAI QRST of 82 mV ⁎ ms provided 60% sensitivity and 55% specificity. In patients with wide QRS greater than 120 milliseconds, the SAI QRST of 138 mV ⁎ ms provided 64% sensitivity and 70% specificity. A test on the equality of ROC areas between patients with narrow and those with wide QRS did not show a statistically significant difference.
SAI QRST in CRT-D patients
Both derivation and validation cohorts patients were included in this analysis. The VT/VF events were less frequent in CRT-D recipients as compared with ICD patients (log-rank test P = .017; Fig. 7A). There was no statistically significant difference in the MMVT rate between ICD and CRT-D patients. However, PVT/VF was observed in 7 patients with single-chamber ICD (3.7%) and 4 patients with dual-chamber ICD (5.2%), but in only 1 CRT-D patient (0.9%; log-rank test P = .017). In univariate Cox regression analysis, risk of sustained VT/VF was lower in patients with implanted CRT-D device than in ICD patients (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24-0.88; P = .020).
Baseline SAI QRST predicted sustained VA events in CRT-D patients (Fig. 7B). In multivariate Cox regression analysis (all-patients cohort) in the model that included SAI QRST, presence of BBB, use of β-blockers, LVDD, and type of device (CRT-D or ICD), SAI QRST less than 145 mV ⁎ ms was associated with 4-fold higher risk of VA (HR, 4.13; 95% CI, 1.96-8.72; P b .0001); use of β-blockers reduced

What is SAI QRST?
The QRST integral was conceived by Wilson et al12 as the time integral of the heart vector26 and expresses the heterogeneity of the action potential (AP) morphology.27 We calculated sum absolute QRST integral, which is a different metric not previously explored. Our choice of orthogonal ECG over 12-lead ECG was based on the advantages provided by orthogonal ECG, which permits assessment of the heart vector. Summation of absolute QRST integral of all 3 orthogonal ECG leads allows assessment of the magnitude of total cardiac electrical power and eliminates bias of singlelead axis position. The precise electrophysiologic meaning of SAI QRST remains to be elucidated. We speculate that (1) the low SAI QRST characterizes significant cancellation of electrical forces as an important preexisting condition that may facilitate sustained VA, (2) low SAI QRST reflects reduced mass of viable myocardium in patients with structural heart disease, and (3) SAI QRST characterizes specific geometry of the heart chambers.

Cancellation of electrical forces results in low SAI QRST
Cancellation of electrical forces in the heart may reduce ECG amplitudes. An estimated 75% of the electrical energy is canceled during ventricular depolarization,28 and 92% to 99% is canceled during repolarization.29 Previous experiments showed that AP morphology gradients in different sites of the heart may have opposing directions and cancel out.30 We speculate that decrease in the sum absolute QRST integral due to cancellation coexists with the locally observed increase in action potential duration (APD) gradients and increased native QRST integral, or “ventricular gradient,” as marker of a heterogeneity of repolarization or heterogeneity of AP morphology.31,32

Substantial evidence supports the idea that patients with structural heart disease have some degree of risk of VA during their lifetime. The strategy of identifying patients at low, rather than high, risk of VA maximizes the benefit of primary prevention ICD, excluding those at low risk of VT/ VF for whom the risk-benefit ratio of the ICD, including congestive heart failure progression,21 is not favorable. Biostatistical studies22-24 have identified the requirements for a good screening test and underscored the value of ROC analysis. Hazard ratios of most commonly used predictors of SCD25 range from 2 to 4, which are insufficient for discrimination. In this analysis, the SAI QRST ROC exhibited a large AUC and HR range of 4 to 6, as well as high sensitivity and negative predictive value, and therefore could be considered as one of the methods for screening of patients with structural heart disease to avoid ICD implantation in those at very low risk of VA.

SAI QRST and QRS width
Our results showed significant correlation between SAI QRST and QRS width. Consistent with previous studies,33,34 we did not find a relation between ventricular conduction abnormalities and VT/VF occurrence in the cohort of all study patients. In addition, antiarrhythmic effect of CRT could affect VT/VF rate in patients with wide QRS and BBB at baseline, as about one third of our study patient population had a CRT-D device implanted. Indeed, we confirmed a statistically significantly lower rate of VT/VF events in CRT-D patients. Subgroup analysis showed that presence of BBB was a significant predictor of VT/VF events in ICD patients, but not in CRT-D patients. Although a correlation between the QRS duration and the SAI QRST is obvious, these metrics are not identical. Notably, SAI QRST predicted VT/VF events in patients with any QRS width. Surprisingly, the predictive accuracy of SAI QRST in patients with wide QRS greater than 120 milliseconds was at least as good as in patients with narrow QRS less than or equal to 120 milliseconds. This important finding may lead to reevaluation of the approach to BBB ECG assessment. A recent report raised the issue of reliability and reproducibility of manual QRS duration measurement.35 The robust automated

measurement of SAI QRST could become a reasonable alternative in the future.
SAI QRST and LV size
Our results revealed significant correlation between SAI QRST and LVDD. Further studies are necessary to determine the relations between SAI QRST and LV geometry, hypertrophy, and dilatation. Of note, our study patients at baseline had remarkably impaired systolic function, LV dilatation, and frequently a large area of myocardial scar. Several previous studies, focused on healthier population of hypertensive patients, showed that Cornell voltage-duration product (RaVL + SV3 [+6 mm in women] ⁎ QRS duration) is associated with the risk of SCD.36-38 Interestingly, in contrast to our findings, a large instead of a small Cornell voltage-duration product was associated with the risk of SCD. Another study of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed that higher (not lower) ECG amplitudes and a high 12-lead QRS amplitude sum predict SCD in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.39 Further studies are necessary to clarify this intriguing issue. We speculate that the SAI QRST characterizes electrical rather than geometrical characteristics of the heart, signifying cancellation of electrical forces in patients with large APD heterogeneity and high risk of life-threatening VA.

implant an ICD, then a risk marker that predicts the occurrence of successfully manageable by an ICD rhythms seems more appropriate than a marker that predicts events for which ICD placement would be of no benefit. At the same time, recent studies showed that patients after appropriate ICD shocks demonstrated higher mortality.21
Statistical power of survival analysis for primary end point (all sustained VA events) and MMVT in this study is good. However, low rate of PVT/VF resulted in low statistical power of survival analysis with PVT/VF end point. The SAI QRST in this study did not predict PVT/VF, but it was highly predictive for MMVT in the primary prevention population of structural heart disease patients. Larger study cohort and longer follow-up are needed for conclusion regarding predictive value of SAI QRST for PVT/VF. At the same time, this preliminary finding may indicate differences in underlying mechanisms of these 2 types of VT and underscores the difficulties in predicting PVT/VF.
Assessment of scar, LV size, and geometry was limited in this study. Further investigation is necessary to determine correlations between SAI QRST and scar size, LV mass, LV hypertrophy and dilatation, and LV volumes.
In summary, SAI QRST is an inexpensive and easily measured at-rest ECG marker for the assessment of VA risk in patients with structural heart disease. High SAI QRST is associated with low risk of sustained VA.

This is the first report showing the predictive value of SAI QRST. Ongoing analysis is determining whether 5 minutes of recorded ECG is necessary or whether a shorter recorded ECG can be enough. Ongoing analysis is also making 2 additional comparisons: the predictive value of SAI QRST calculated from orthogonal ECG vs inverse Dower transforms derived from standard 12-lead ECG and the predictive value of the QRS amplitude vs SAI QRST.
Importantly, virtually any ECG recorded during sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation is amenable to this analysis, thereby extending the opportunity for noninvasive VT/VF risk stratification in patient populations that would not be eligible for it otherwise.
Further studies are needed to clarify the extent to which SAI QRST reflects underlying cardiac anatomy (LV hypertrophy and/or dilatation, scar size). In this study, SAI QRST remained the significant predictor in the model in the presence of the LVDD variable, thus confirming the complementary predictive value of the sum electrical forces descriptor.
Limitations
Appropriate ICD therapy as a surrogate for sudden death may overestimate the frequency of SCD.34 This is a wellrecognized and unavoidable limitation in the ICD era, as it would be unethical to withhold ICD therapy to study the actual death rate. The use of ICD events as the end point for validation of a risk stratifier is frequently viewed as a weak surrogate for actual mortality. However, as soon as the VT/ VF risk stratification guides the decision about whether to
