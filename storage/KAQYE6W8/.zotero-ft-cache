neuroendocrine

cells

(PNECs) ar e airway epithelial cells that are capable of

secreting a variety of neuropeptides. PNECs are scattered

throughout the bronchial tree either as individual cells or

clusters of cells termed neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs). PNECs

and their secretory peptides have been considered to play a

role in fetal lung development. Although the normal physi-

ological function of PNECs and neuropeptides in normal

adult lungs and in repair from lung injury is not known,

PNEC hyperplasia has been associated with chronic lung

diseases, such as bronchopulmonary

dysplasia, and with

chronic exposures, such as hypoxia, tobacco smoke, nitrosa-

mines, and ozone. To evaluate changes in PNEC number and

distribution after acute airway injury, FVB/n mice were

treated with either naphthalene or vehicle. Naphthalene is

an aromatic hydrocarbon that, at the dose used in this study,

selectively destroys nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells

(Clara cells) through cytochrome P-450-mediated metabolic

activation into cytotoxic epoxides. PNECs were identified by

immunohistochemical

analysis of calcitonin gene-related pep-

tide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR). Proliferating cells were

marked with [3H] thymidine incorporation. Acute naphtha-

lene toxicity results in PNEC hyperplasia that is detectable

after 5 days of recovery. PNEC hyperplasia is characterized

by increased numbers of NEBs without significant changes in

the number of isolated PNECs and by increased [3H]thymi-

dine labeling of CGRP-IR cells. These data show that cell

proliferation contributes to PNEC hyperplasia after acute

airway injury and suggest that PNECs may be capable of

more rapidly increasing their number in response to injury

than previously recognized.

PULMONARY

NEUROENDOCRINE

CELLS (PNECs) are

sparsely distributed airway epithelial cells that have

been implicated in fetal lung growth and differentia-

tion. PNECs secrete several neuropeptides, including

gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP, a mammalian homo-

logue of the amphibian peptide bombesin), calcitonin

gene-related peptide (CGRP), and chromogranin A

(CGA) (37). In fetal mouse lung, GRP has been shown to

enhance [3H] choline incorporation into saturated phos-

phatidylcholine, [3H]leucine incorporation into protein,

[3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and to increase

the relative number of type II pneumocytes (35,36). In

murine lung explants, bombesin enhances branching

morphogenesis but does not increase cell proliferation

(1, 15). GRP is mitogenic for Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (27), PNECs (31), and bronchial epithelial cells (45). In airway development, PNECs have paracrine effects on cell proliferation. Hoyt et al. (8) documented an increase in proliferation of non-PNECs in the immediate vicinity of neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) compared with more distant regions.
PNEC hyperplasia has been associated with chronic lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (13), and with pollutant exposures, such as tobacco smoke (37), ozone (ll), and nitrosamines (18, 38, 40). The role of PNECs and their secretory neuropeptides during repair from injury is not clear. Classically, NEBs have been considered to be chemoreceptors responding to airway hypoxia (17,47). GRP is both a vasoconstrictor and bronchoconstrictor (10, 16, 28), whereas CGRP is a pulmonary vasodilator (20, 43) and a bronchoconstrictor (5). Consequently, PNECs and their secretory peptides GRP and CGRP have been implicated in regulating airway tone and pulmonary blood flow during respiration.
PNECs can be isolated individual airway epithelial cells or innervated clusters of cells termed NEBs. NEBs are located exclusively within the conducting airways and are commonly found at airway branch points (4,9, 30). Studies investigating the mechanism for increased PNEC numbers observed during lung development have detected few mitotic figures or little [3H]thymidine labeling, suggesting that mature PNECs have a reduced capacity to undergo mitosis (7, 8). PNEC hyperplasia, defined as increased numbers of PNECs, may then be due to differentiation of progenitor cells (8, 31, 40). Alternatively, an apparent PNEC hyperplasia may result from enhanced PNEC detection when intracellular levels of neuropeptides are increased to levels detectable by immunohistochemistry such as would occur with changes in gene transcription or peptide secretion. Sunday and Willet (38) suggested that altered neuropeptide gene transcription contributes to the induction of PNEC hyperplasia and later spontaneous regression after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injections and continuous hyperoxia (38). Reduced CGRP secretion during acute hypoxia has been proposed by Roncalli et al. (26) to explain observed increases in CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR) within PNECs as early as 4 h after exposure to hypoxia.
Studies i.nvestigating the m.echanism of ‘PNEC hyperplasia after injury are difficult because of the chronic nature of the injury needed to observe hyperplasia. In a hamster model, Linnoila (18) described PNEC hyperplasia and increased neuroendocrine cell (NEC) prolifera-

tion after a 4-wk exposure to twice weekly injections of DEN. The greatest changes were seen after a 3-mo exposure. Studies combining DEN and hyperoxia or hyperoxia alone have shown increased lung neuropeptide levels in hamsters 3 wk or more after exposure (22, 38, 40), although these changes may not be sustained (38). For tobacco smoke, PNEC hyperplasia was shown in hamsters after a 3-wk exposure (41). PNEC hyperplasia has also been described in lungs from neonatal rabbits adapted to high altitude and chronic hypoxia (14, 42) but not in adult rats exposed to 7 days of hypoxia (21).
In the present study, we have used naphthalene injury to the conducting airway epithelium to evoke a repair response. This model was chosen to understand how selective conducting airway injury participates in the establishment of PNEC hyperplasia. Naphthalene is a component of cigarette smoke (29) that, in the mouse, causes selective airway cell injury due to activation to cytotoxic epoxides by cytochrome P-450 2F2 and 2B within nonciliated (Clara) cells (25). We have previously shown that airway branch points are sites of early nonciliated bronchial epithelial cell (Clara cell) differentiation after injury and a preferential site of cell proliferation at the 72-h postnaphthalene time point (34). This pattern of differentiation and proliferation is similar to the spatial distribution of NEBs in the lung. We investigated the hypothesis that PNECs respond to acute conducting airway cell injury by increasing their numbers through a mechanism involving both cell proliferation and differentiation.

MATERIALS

AND METHODS

AnimaZs and treatments. Naphthalene (300 mg/kg) in corn

oil vehicle or vehicle alone was administered intraperitone-

ally to 7- to 9-wk-old male FVB/n mice (6 mice/group).

Animals were obtained from Taconic Farms Animal Breeders

(Germantown, NY) and were housed in a pathogen-free

environment during a &day acclimatization and observation

period before experimental treatments. [3H] thymidine (20

Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) was adminis-

tered intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.5 pCi/kg between 36 and

72 h after naphthalene or corn oil treatments. Lungs were

harvested at 5 days after injury and inflation fixed in 10%

neutral buffered Formalin at 20 cm pressure. The right lower

lobe was embedded in paraffin, and &urn sections were taken

parallel to the lobar bronchus to include the major airway

branches leading to terminal bronchioles.

Immunohistochemistry

and tissue autoradiography.

Tis-

sues were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in graded

alcohol washes. Each section was blocked by incubation with

10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in phosphate-buffered saline

(PBS). Polyclonal rabbit anti-rat CGRP (Sigma, St. Louis,

MO) was used as primary antibody at a dilution of l:l,OOO in

10% FBS. Slides were washed in PBS, and an alkaline

phosphatase conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-rabbit anti-

body (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody at a 1:150

dilution in 10% FBS. After three PBS washes, alkaline

phosphatase was detected using a BCIP/NBT kit according to

the manufacturers instructions (Sigma).

For [3H] thymidine labeling studies, biotinylated secondary

antibody with a horseradish peroxidase 3,3’-diaminobenzi-

dine (DAB) color development system was used. The peroxi-

dase detection system was used because it permitted tritium

detection. Tissues were processed for immunohistochemical

staining as outlined above, except endogenous peroxidases

were quenched with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for

15 min before blocking. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antise-

rum (Cappel Laboratories, Oganon Teknika, West Chester,

PA) was used at a dilution of l:l,OOO in 10% FBS. Secondary

antibody was detected using a strepavidin solution (Vec-

tastain ABC; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) prepared

according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by a

DAB color development solution (Vector). Tissues were coun-

terstained with hematoxylin. As a second marker for PNECs,

CGA immunostaining was performed using polyclonal rabbit

anti-bovine SP-l/CGA (Incstar, Stillwater, MN) at a dilution

of 1:2,000. This primary antibody was incubated with the

tissue overnight at 4°C. The secondary antibody was biotinyl-

ated goat anti-rabbit antibody with avidin-biotin horseradish

peroxidase (Vector) used with a DAB color development

system.

Tritium labeling of lung tissue was detected using autoradi-

ography. Tissues were double dipped in NBT II photoemul-

sion (Kodak, Rochester, NY), exposed for 7 days, and devel-

oped with D-19 (Kodak) according to the manufacturers

instructions. Tissues were dehydrated in graded alcohols,

mounted using a xylene-based mounting media, and covered

with coverslips. To assess the adequacy and consistency of

[“Hlthymidine labeling, each animal’s right testis was taken

and digested, and total DNA was isolated. [“Hlthymidine

incorporation into total DNA was then measured. There was

comparable tritium incorporation into all animals, indicating

consistent and reliable delivery of the [3H] thymidine.

Morphometry and statistical analysis. Five sections at

lo-urn intervals cut through regions of optimal airway branch-

ing were immunostained to localize CGRP. The middle (third)

section was used as the reference slide from which all

measurements were based. A digital image that included all

conducting airway epithelium observed in this section was

made. The total airway epithelial basement membrane (BM)

length and the length of BM subtending CGRP-IR regions

were traced and measured using Metamorph image analysis

software. To discriminate isolated immunoreactive cells from

larger groups, each CGRP-IR region was followed through

two serial sections on each side of the reference section (total

span = 45 pm). An isolated PNEC was defined as a CGRP-IR

region containing only one nucleus or (15 um2. Collections of

PNECs, i.e., NEBs, were defined as CGRP-IR regions >15

um2. Data were collected from each animal and analyzed

using the Student’s t-test for unpaired samples.

The length of each CGRP-IR region was determined immu-

nohistochemically using an alkaline phosphatase detection

system. For CGRP-IR cell nuclei counts and autoradiography,

one section from each animal was subjected to analysis.

Counts for CGRP-IR nuclei were determined in tissues

stained for CGRP-IR cells using horseradish peroxidase and

DAB color development counterstained with hematoxylin.

Total BM was traced and measured as above. CGRP-IR cell

nuclei were then counted and expressed per millimeter BM.

Autoradiography

was performed on these tissues to deter-

mine the thymidine labeling index of CGRP-IR cells. To

quantitate [3H] thymidine labeling of CGRP-IR cells, the

number of cells that were both CGRP immunoreactive and

that had at least five silver grains overlying the nucleus was

expressed as a percentage of all CGRP-IR cells. An effort was

made to count similar numbers of CGRP-IR cells. An average

of 55 CGRP-IR cells was counted from naphthalene-treated

animals (n = 6 animals; 1 tissue section from each animal),

and 30 CGRP-IR cells were counted from vehicle only animals

(n = 6 animals; 2 sections from each animal). The presence of

tritium in a cell nucleus was indicated by silver grains
overlying the nucleus. We chose five silver grains overlying the nucleus as indicative of cell proliferation based on a comparison between the number of silver grains overlying
intestinal villous crypt and apical enterocytes. The background signal for thymidine labeling was extremely low. Data were collected from each animal and analyzed using the
Student’s t-test for unpaired samples.

RESULTS

Airway CGRP-IR is increased after acute epithelial

injury. Airway epithelium from mice treated with ei-

ther a single dose of naphthalene or corn oil (vehicle)

were analyzed at 5 days recovery for CGRP-IR using

immunohistochemistry

for the PNEC marker CGRP

Figure 1 shows a representative photomicrograph dem-

onstrating increased CGRP immunostaining of tissue

prepared from mice 5 days postnaphthalene treatment

vs. mice treated with corn oil vehicle alone. Quantita-

tive measurements demonstrated a fourfold increase in

areas of CGRP immunoreactivity,

as shown in Fig. 2.

The percentage of BM subtending CGRP-positive cells

was 2.32 + 0.25% 5 days after naphthalene treatment

compared with 0.38 + 0.11% in vehicle-treated animals

(P < 0.001). Similar increases were observed in the

number of CGRP-IR cell nuclei per millimeter

BM (2.68 + 0.21 vs. 0.63 t 0.27, P < 0.0011, represent-

ing a similar fourfold increase after naphthalene treat-

ment.

Acute airway injury is associated with increased

L3Hlthymidine incorporation into CGRP-IR cells. To

help understand the basis for the increased number of

PNECs, CGRP immunoreactive cells were evaluated

for proliferation by 13H]thymidine labeling. Cells ac-

tively synthesizing DNA at the time of 13Hlthymidine

injection were detected by the presence of black silver grains. Cells were considered to have significant label-

ing if at least five silver grains were overlying the

nucleus (Fig. 3). The number of proliferating CGRP-IR

cells per millimeter BM was significantly greater in

naphthalene-treated

animals (0.324 + 0.052) than in

vehicle only controls (0.025 ? 0.025, P < 0.001). To

further characterize differences in cell proliferation,

the proliferative index of CGRP-IR cells was deter-

mined. A significantly greater percentage of CGRP-IR

cells were tritium labeled in naphthalene-treated

ani-

mals (12.0 ? 1.4%) than in vehicle only animals (3.3 ?

3.3%, P = 0.04; Table 1).

determine the surface area of each NEB, each CGRP-IR

animals. In separate sections from the same animals,

analyzed by the number of CGRP-IR cell nuclei within

each CGRP-IR region. The number of regions contain-

ing more than one CGRP-IR cell nucleus was 0.463 ?

animals vs.

0.110 2 O.O56/mm BM in vehicle-treated animals (P =

cantly different in naphthalene-treated

(0.064 ? 0.024)

vs. vehicle-treated (0.038 2 0.019, P = 0.41) animals.

The significantly increased number of CGRP-IR re-

gions >15 um2/mm BM and CGRP-IR regions with

more than one CGRP-IR nucleus per millimeter BM

suggests an increased number of NEBs rather than an

increased number of isolated PNECs. Although not

morphometrically studied, CGRP-IR nerve fibers were

freauentlv observed innervating NEBs. Of note. few

inflammatory cells were seen in any of the tissue

sections.

Immunohistochemistry

for CGA was used to confirm

regions containing PNECs. There was excellent correla-

tion between regions of CGA-like immunoreactivity

and CGRP-IR on adjacent serial sections. However, the

CGA antibody reaction was considerably less intense

than that for CGRP. This may be due to low cross-

reactivity between anti-bovine CGA antibody and mouse

CGA.

Measurements of the size of each NEB did not reveal

significant differences. The average length of a CGRP-IR

region in control animals compared with naphthalene-

treated animals was 34.4 ? 3.9 and 42.9 t 4.0 urn,

respectively (P = 0.16). The number of CGRP-IR cell

nuclei per CGRP-IR region in control vs. treated ani-

mals was 4.4 t 1.1 vs. 5.25 t 0.4 (P = 0.45). Together,

these data indicate that recovery from acute naphtha-

lene injury results in increased numbers of NEBs but

no change in the average size of each NEB and no

change in the number of isolated PNECs.

DISCUSSION
Acute airway injury results in rapid PNEC hyperplasia. We have demonstrated that repair from acute injury to the conducting airway epithelium is associated with increased CGRP-IR characterized by a significant increase in the proportion of airway BM subtending CGRP-IR cells. In other studies, increased CGRP-IR has been attributed to cell hypertrophy (32) and increased intracellular CGRP content (19, 26) rather than cell hyperplasia. In our model, we have shown an increased number of CGRP-IR cells per millimeter BM. Furthermore, the mechanism responsible for increased numbers of CGRP-IR cells includes cell proliferation, as indicated by an increased [3H]thymidine labeling index. By our current methods, the proportion of PNEC hyperplasia directly attributable to cell proliferation cannot be determined. Consequently, mechanisms in addition to cell proliferation may be contributing to the observed PNEC hyperplasia in our study. In models of PNEC hyperplasia in which little cell proliferation is seen, it has been suggested that PNEC hyperplasia may be the result of differentiation of mature PNECs from epithelial stem cells, undifferentiated but committed PNECs, or immature PNECs (38). Our data are consistent with the possibility that PNEC differentiation along with cell proliferation contribute to PNEC hyperplasia after acute airway injury.
PNEC hyperplasia has been described after chronic exposures to several classes of lung toxicants. Oxidant stress, such as continuous exposure to ozone (11) or hyperoxia (23), has been associated with PNEC hyperplasia as have hypoxia (14) and living at high altitude (42). After acute inhalation burn injury in humans, elevated serum calcitonin persisting for up to eight years has been described. However, changes in the NEC population were not able to be assessed (2). Both mainstream tobacco smoke (41) and sidestream tobacco smoke (12) are associated with PNEC hyperplasia. With tobacco smoke, the effect on PNEC number has been attributed to the following two smoke subfrac-

to metabolize naphthalene to cytotoxic derivatives than are mice, due to differences in cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes (3). Parenterally administered naphthalene does, however, appear to a useful model to study the effects of acute, selective Clara cell injury by lipophilic cytotoxicants.
PNEC hyperplasia after acute airway injury is restricted to NEBs through a mechanism including increased cell proliferation. The spatial pattern of PNEC hyperplasia is charactcrizcd by an increased number of PNEC clusters or NEBs. However, the number of PNECs per NEB and the number of isolated PNECs are not significantly different between treated and control groups. This pattern of hyperplasia is consistent with the findings of Joad et al. (12) in a study of rats exposed to sidestream tobacco smoke in utero and/or postnatally. They also found increased numbers of NEBs but found that the average size of each NEB was similar, suggesting that the increased number of NECs is not simply due to the enlargement of existing NEBs. In contrast, Sunday and Willet (381, in a model of preneoplastic lung injury, found increased numbers of PNECs within NEBs at 6-7 wk of continuous exposure to DEN

Based on previous observations of spatially controlled airway cell proliferation and redifferentiation after acute naphthalene injury (34), we chose to investigate changes in the PNEC population at 5 days into the repair response. After acute injury, Clara cell death is evident by marked reductions in the number of cells with Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) immunoreactivity. Airways are initially repopulated with an immature (non-CCSP expressing) cell population that then is replaced with mature Clara cells in a process that begins preferentially at airway branch points (34). Maximal cell proliferation is seen during a 36-h window beginning at -36 h after injury and ending at 72 h. By 72 h after the insult, airway epithelial cell proliferation is primarily restricted to airway branch points. In this study, animals were injected with [3H]thymidine during the 36-h period of maximal cell proliferation. At 5 days recovery, a significant increase in the number of 3H-labeled CGRP-IR cells was seen in naphthalenetreated animals vs. vehicle only controls. Montuenga et al. (21) demonstrated proliferation of PNECs in the lungs of both normal and hypoxic rats. The PNEC proliferation rate was similar in rats exposed to 7 days of hypoxia compared with controls. This may be because 7 days of hypoxia did not generate PNEC hyperplasia. In a hamster model of airway injury, Linnoila (18) described NEC hyperplasia and increased NEC proliferation after a 3- to 4-wk exposure to twice weekly injections of DEN.

In our study, PNEC hyperplasia developed rapidly (by 5 days after injury), suggesting that NECs may be capable of more rapidly increasing their number in response to stimuli than previously appreciated. We have not demonstrated that fully differentiated PNECs proliferate but rather that cell proliferation contributes to a significant increase in PNEC number. The phenotype and lineage of the proliferating cells at the time that they proliferate is not clear. The observation that similar or increased numbers of PNECs exist along with increased numbers of NEBs suggests differentiation of progenitor cells into PNECs or de novo formation of NEBs. If clonal expansion of the existing PNECs into NEBs is the only mechanism for increased numbers of NEBs, a depleted number of mature, isolated PNECs would result. Little is known of the progenitor relationships for PNECs in lung repair. In lung development, recent work has suggested coexpression of the immunohistochemical markers CGRP, CCSP, and surfactant protein A on serial sections during mouse embryogenesis, embryonic days 13-15 (46). This suggests a common lineage for such diverse cell types as Clara cells, PNECs, and alveolar type II cells. It is known that alveolar type II cells may transiently express neuropeptide markers. Isolated rat alveolar type II cells secrete CGRP in culture (6), whereas hamster type II cells in vivo transiently immunostain for bombesin after combined hyperoxia and DEN exposure (23).
The physiological significance of PNEC hyperplasia during repair from injury is not clear. NEBs have paracrine effects on cell proliferation during lung development. In fetal Syrian golden hamsters, Hoyt et al. (8)

carefully documented a statistical increase in non-

PNEC proliferation immediately adjacent to NEBs

compared with more distant regions and suggested

that a few nonneuroendocrine daughter cells may enter

NEBs. This agrees with our impression (suggested in

Fig. 3) that cell proliferation is increased in non-PNECs

adjacent to NEBs after naphthalene toxicity. Two PNEC

secretory neuropeptides, GRP and CGRP, are mitogens

for airway epithelial cells (44, 45) and therefore may

play a role in stimulating cell proliferation to initiate

repopulation of injured epithelium. Classically, PNECs

have been considered airway chemoreceptors respond-

ing to changes in airway oxygen tension (17,47). GRP is

a bronchoconstrictor

(10, 28), whereas CGRP is a

vasodilator (20, 43). One may speculate that NEBs

containing GRP and CGRP and located at airway

branch points are uniquely positioned to regulate re-

gional ventilation and perfusion by regulating bron-

chial and vascular smooth muscle tone. In this way, in

normal lung, oxygenation may be optimized through

matching ventilation and perfusion, whereas lung in-

jury by inhaled toxicants may be limited by regulating

regional ventilation and perfusion. Consistent with

this theory, the major sensory innervation of NEBs,

C-nerve fibers containing CGRP, has been suggested to

play a protective role in inhaled ozone exposure by

inducing bronchospasm and by altering respiratory

reflexes such as cough and rapid shallow breathing

(33). Further studies are required to understand the

role of secretory neuropeptides in lung repair and in

exploring their role in regulating pulmonary physiol-

ogy. In summary, we have shown that repair of the
murine airway after single-dose, acute naphthalene toxicity is associated with PNEC hyperplasia in a pattern that is restricted to NEBs as early as 5 days after injury. The mechanism responsible for PNEC hyperplasia is not clear but includes cell proliferation. Furthermore, the mechanism appears to include differentiation of both an existing progenitor population and newly proliferated cells into NECs. Whether hyperplastic PNECs and their secretory neuropeptides participate in regulating repair responses, physiological parameters, or are nonspecifically generated during epithelial renewal remains to be determined.

We thank Gregory Mango and Dr. Jacob Finkelstein for thoughtful
