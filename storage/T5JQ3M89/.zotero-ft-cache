SUMMARY One hundred and fifty unselected patients with documented coronary artery disease were studied to establish the frequency and characteristics of silent myocardial ischaemia. Patients underwent ambulatory ST segment monitoring off all routine antianginal treatment (total 6264 hours) and exercise testing (n = 146). Ninety one patients (61%) had a total of 598 episodes of significant ST segment change, of which 446 (75%) were asymptomatic. Twenty seven patients (18%) had only painless episodes; 14 (9%) patients only painful episodes; 50 patients (33%) had both painless and painful episodes. The mean number of ST segment changes per day was 2'58 (1 95 silent); however, 11 patients (7%) had 50% of all silent episodes, and 48 patients (32%) had 91% of all silent episodes. Fifty nine patients (39%) had no ST segment changes on ambulatory monitoring, and 73 patients (49%) had no evidence ofsilent ischaemia. Episodes ofsilent ischaemia occurred with a similar circadian distribution to that of painful ischaemia, predominantly between 0730 and 1930. There was a similar mean rise in heart rate at the onset of both silent and painful episodes ofischaemia. Silent ischaemia was significantly more frequent in patients with three vessel disease than in those with single vessel disease, and was also significantly related to both time to 1 mm ST depression and maximal exercise duration on exercise testing. There was a highly
significant relation between the mean number and duration of episodes of silent ischaemia in patients with positive exercise tests when compared with those with negative tests. No episode of ventricular tachycardia was recorded in association with silent ischaemic change.

It has been known for many years that myocardial
infarction can occur in the absence of angina or its equivalents,'2 and since the introduction of ambulatory ST segment monitoring it has become
clear that ST segment depression, the electrocardiographic hallmark of ischaemia, is a common
finding in patients with coronary artery disease and is
"silent" in most ofthem.?5 These silent ST segment
changes have been shown to be truly ischaemic by
various haemodynamic7 and radionuclide"'0 tech-
niques.
The therapeutic and prognostic significance of silent myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina has yet to be elucidated. But if silent myocardial ischaemia is a

frequent event in patients with coronary artery disease, angina or its equivalents may no longer be the primary features to be considered before proceeding to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, in view ofthe possible relation between silent ischaemia and both myocardial infarction"" and sudden death." 14 15
We studied 150 unselected patients with documented coronary artery disease off routine antianginal medications to establish the frequency and characteristics of silent myocardial ischaemia. Previous studies have reported smaller numbers, and some studies used highly selected patients.

pain, or after myocardial infarction. There were 121 men and 29 women (mean age 55 years, range 33-77 years). All had clinically significant coronary artery disease. Sixty one patients had had at least one myocardial infarction. All patients underwent 24-48 hours of ambulatory ST segment monitoring off all routine antianginal medications, and 146 performed exercise testing according to the modified Bruce protocol. For each individual we recorded the details of anginal history, history of previous myocardial infarction, and previous angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. We recorded the details of the resting electrocardiogram, left ventriculogram, coronary anatomy, and left ventricular ejection fraction.
EXERCISE TESTING
One hundred and forty six patients underwent maximal symptom limited treadmill exercise testing according to the modified Bruce protocol. Three patients were unable to exercise because of severe intermittent claudication and one could not cope with the treadmill. Electrocardiograms were recorded at the start of exercise and every three minutes thereafter and whenever chest pain, hypotension, or significant ST segment depression developed. A test was considered to be positive ifthere was ST segment depression of > 1 mm which was planar or downsloping and persisted for 0-08 s after the J point. Exercise was limited by the development of chest pain, dyspnoea, exhaustion, complex ventricular arrhytbmias, or hypotension.
AMBULATORY ST SEGMENT MONITORING
All patients underwent 48 hours of ambulatory ST segment monitoring with pre-gelled electrodes to record two bipolar leads, an anterior lead CM5, and an inferior lead. The sites and method of application of these electrodes have been described elsewhere."6 Two-channel recordings were then obtained on magnetic tape by a frequency modulated dual-channel recorder (Oxford Medilog 2, frequency response 0 05-40 Hz). The frequency response of this system is sufficient to record and display the ST segment accurately. The tapes were then visually analysed at 60 times normal speed by an Oxford Medilog MA20
scanner, and all printouts were at 25 mm/s. Significant ST segment depression was defined as planar
or downsloping ST segment shift of >, mm measured O-)8 s after the J point that persisted for >30 s. Significant ST segment elevation was defined as an upward shift of the ST segment of > 1 mm at the J point compared with the resting recording. Changes in the T wave vector were not regarded as evidence of myocardial ischaemia unless they were accompanied by significant ST segment changes.

During the period of ambulatory monitoring, all patients kept a detailed angina diary to record the time of each episode of pain, the activity at the onset of symptoms, and the requirement for glyceryl trinitrate. They pressed an event marker on the ambulatory monitor at the onset of symptoms. This marked the magnetic tape, which meant that the electrocardiographic playback would automatically display the electrocardiogram at that time. All patients were encouraged to continue their normal activities during the period of monitoring.
COLLECTION OF DATA DURING AMBULATORY
MONITORING
The following details were extracted and incorporated in the data bank: the heart rate immediately before and at the onset of each episode of ischaemia; the duration of each episode; maximal ST segment change; the relation ofeach episode to symptoms; the presence of arrhythmias, and whether they occurred in association with silent or painful episodes.
CARDIAC CATHETERISATION
In all patients we used either the Judkins or Sones technique for cardiac catheterisation. All angiograms were reported on independently by one oftwo senior radiologists, and a random selection were further reviewed by a cardiologist. Stenoses that reduced the luminal diameter of a major vessel by > 70% were regarded as significant. For the purposes ofclassification, significant left main coronary artery disease was regarded as two vessel disease.
The left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by a standard method, with two-frame analysis ofthe left ventriculogram in the right anterior oblique position.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Bivariate statistics-We tested for the significance of relations between silent ischaemia and the variables of interest by non-parametric analysis. The MannWhitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, or the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test was used, as appropriate.
Multivariate statistics-Discriminant function analysis was performed to ascertain which variables could be used to predict the frequency of silent ischaemia on ambulatory monitoring.

Silent myocardial ischaemia in chronic stable angina
hundred and forty six episodes (75%) were asymptomatic. The mean duration of attacks (20-8 v 21-6 min) and mean severity of ST segment change (154 v 1-89 mm) were similar in both painless and painful episodes, as was the mean heart rate at the onset of both painless and painful episodes (95 v 99 beats/min). There was a significant increase in mean heart rate at the onset ofboth silent (86-95 beats/mi, p < 0001) and painful (88-99 beats/min, p < 0-001) ischaemia. There was no increase in heart rate at the onset of ischaemia in 163 instances (128 silent (29%), 35 painful (23%)). The mean number of ischaemic episodes per day was 2-58 of which 1-95 were silent. Fifteen (10%) patients had five or more episodes of silent ischaemia per day.
RELATION BETWEEN ISCHAEMIC CHANGES AND
SYMPTOMS
Figure- 1 shows the relation between ischaemic change on ambulatory monitoring and symptoms. Ninety one patients (61%) had one or more episodes of ischaemia. Fifty (33%) had mixed painful and painless episodes, and 27 (18%) had painless episodes only. Fifty nine patients (39%) had no ischaemic changes during 2548 hours of monitoring, and 73 patients (49%) had no silent ischaemic changes. Fifteen (10%) patients had 50% of all episodes ofischaemia, and 60 (40%) had 90% oftotal episodes. Eleven patients (7%) had 50% of episodes of silent ischaemia and 48 patients (32%) had 91% of the episodes of silent ischaemia (fig 2).

RELATION OF SILENT ISCHAEMIA TO CORONARY
ANATOMY
Forty six patients (31 %) had single vessel, 37 (25%)
two vessel, and 67 (44%) three vessel coronary artery disease. Episodes of silent and total ischaemia were significantly more common in three vessel disease
than in one vessel disease (p < 0-05) (fig 3). Mean ST segment depression in those with three vessel disease was also significantly greater during attacks than in those with single vessel disease (p < 0-001).
RELATION OF SILENT ISCHAEMIA TO EXERCISE
TESTING
One hundred and forty six patients underwent treadmill exercise testing. One hundred and one (69%) patients had a positive test for ischaemia. Sixty four patients (63%) with a positive exercise test had at least one episode of silent ischaemia on monitoring. Eleven (25%) of the 45 patients with a negative exercise test had one or more episodes of silent ischaemia. Figure 4 shows the frequency distribution of silent ST segment change throughout the day. Only 15 (10%) patients had > 5 episodes of silent ischaemia per day, and 14 (93%) ofthese had a positive exercise test at less than six minutes of exercise. One patient with a negative exercise test had documented coronary artery spasm.
We compared the mean heart rates at the onset of silent ischaemic change on monitoring with heart rate at 1 mm ST segment depression on exercise in 64 patients. The onset heart rate on ambulatory moni-

We divided the positive exercise tests into those with < 2 mm and those with >2 mm ST segment depression, and we compared the mean number and duration of episodes of silent ischaemia on ambulatory monitoring in the two subgroups. No significant differences were noted. There was no association between the frequency ofsilent ischaemia and time taken for the electrocardiogram to become normal after exercise.
We compared the mean frequency and duration of
episodes ofsilent ischaemia with the stage to maximal exercise in 45 patients with a negative exercise test. This confirmed a low frequency and duration of silent ischaemia in the subgroup as a whole, irrespec-
tive ofstage to maximum exercise. Ofthe 43 episodes (9 6%) of silent ischaemia recorded in this group, 15 (35%) occurred in one patient with coronary spasm.

In the 101 patients with a positive test the mean

RELATION OF SILENT ISCHAEMIA TO LEFT
VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION AND A
HISTORY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
The 89 patients who had not suffered a previous myocardial infarction tended to have an increased frequency of silent ischaemic episodes (p = 0 072) that lasted significantly longer (p < 0 05) than silent episodes in the 61 patients who had suffered one or more previous infarctions. The frequency of silent ischaemia was also inversely related to the presence of dyskinetic/akinetic areas on the left ventriculogram (p < 0 01). There was no relation between left ventricular ejection fraction and silent ST segment change.
RELATION OF SILENT ISCHAEMIA AND THE
FREQUENCY OF VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS
Thirteen patients (8 6%) had one or more recorded episodes of ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular bigeminy, multifocal ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular couplets, or ventricular tachycardia) during the 6264 hours of ambulatory monitoring. Six patients had episodes of unsustained ventricular tachycardia; however, none occurred in association with silent ischaemia.
CIRCADIAN DISTRIBUTION OF SILENT
ISCHAEMIC EPISODES
Figure 6 shows the distribution of episodes of both total and silent ischaemia. Most episodes (67% ofthe total, 67% of the painless, and 68% of painful episodes) occurred in the twelve hour period between 0730 and 1930.

tomatic. Until now the frequency distribution of silent ischaemic episodes has not been examined in detail, and it has been suggested that most patients with angina may have frequent episodes of silent
ischaemiaY'7 We found that silent ischaemia was
frequent in a small but appreciable proportion of the population of patients with coronary artery disease; however, almost half of the patients had no evidence of silent ischaemia on up to 48 hours of ambulatory monitoring, and over half of all silent ischaemic episodes occurred in only 7% of the patients.
We also examined the pathophysiological causes of silent myocardial ischaemia. The exact mechanisms by which silent ischaemia occurs are unknown, but many workers have reported that out of hospital episodes of ischaemia occur at a lower heart rate than the heart rate at the onset of 1 mm ST segment depression on exercise testing81819 and that this suggests that an increase in vasoconstrictor tone in the coronary vessels contributes to the genesis of ischaemia.'9 Rozanski et al, however, point out that although the heart rate at the onset of ischaemia is

lower during mental stress than during exercise, there are substantial increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure that increase the afterload to values seen during exercise and that catecholamine secretion, and possibly its rate of rise, might further contribute to significant increases in myocardial
oxygen demand during stress, even if an increase in
oxygen demand is not suggested by the change in heart rate.' We found that silent ischaemia does indeed occur at a lower heart rate than that at the
onset ofischaemia on exercise testing, as also does ST change accompanied by angina. ST segment monitoring showed that the increases in heart rate to silent
or painful ischaemia were not different. Also a similar proportion of silent and painful episodes of ST
segment depression occurred in the waking hours. These findings indicate that the pathophysiological mechanisms of silent ischaemia do not differ from
those of painful ischaemia. We found an increase in
heart rate before the onset of ST segment depression
in most episodes of ischaemia; but in approximately
one quarter of instances heart rate did not increase
before either the silent or the painful episodes. Thus the same mechanisms seem to cause painful
and painless myocardial ischaemia; and so drugs that are effective in the relief of angina should also be effective in the treatment of silent ischaemia, as has indeed been shown.21
The occurrence, frequency, and duration of silent ischaemia correlated most closely with the exercise test. The frequency and duration of silent ischaemia increased considerably in those patients with a positive exercise test at low workloads, thus confirming the findings of Quyyumi et al'6 and Cambell et al.' Indeed, in those patients whose exercise test was not positive until after stage 2 of the modified Bruce protocol, or whose exercise test was negative, silent ischaemia was very uncommon, which sup-
ports the assertion of Epstein et al.23 We also found a relation between the frequency of
silent ischaemia and the extent of coronary artery disease, as did Kunkes et al.' This might be expected because the exercise test has been shown to correlate loosely with the extent of coronary disease. This relation, however, is much less close than that between silent ischaemia and the exercise test.
Interestingly, patients without a previous history of myocardial infarction had a non-significant trend towards more frequent episodes of silent ischaemia that lasted significantly longer than in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. This may be because patients who have suffered one or more previous myocardial infarctions have less viable myocardium capable ofbecoming ischaemic, and this is supported by the finding of significantly less silent ischaemia in patients with dyskinetic/akinetic seg-

ments on left ventriculography. Another explanation is that the electrocardiographic effects of previous myocardial infarction obscure alterations in the ST
segment. Finally, this study confirms that ventricular arr-
hythmias are relatively uncommon in unselected patients with coronary artery disease.2" While a causative relation between silent ischaemia and ventricular irritability might be expected, this was not found in our subjects.
The results of this study do not imply that silent ischaemia is unimportant in clinical practice; however, it seems that silent ischaemia is probably most important in a small proportion of the population of patients with coronary artery disease. Where facilities for ambulatory monitoring are limited or not available, exercise testing should provide a means of identifying the majority of such patients, particularly if the test is positive at low workloads. Further studies will be necessary to determine the prognostic implications of silent ischaemia in patients with chronic stable angina, and whether the prognosis can be altered by medical or surgical treatment.
