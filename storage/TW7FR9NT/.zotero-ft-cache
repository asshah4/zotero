NeuroImage , Volume 54, Issue 1, January 2011, Pages 635-644 
 
Abstract 
Evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) is associated with the maintenance of cognitive function across the lifespan. In contrast, the apolipoproteinE-ε4 (APOE-ε4) allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with impaired cognitive function. The objective of this study was to examine the interactive effects of PA and APOE-ε4 on brain activation during memory processing in older (ages 65-85) cognitively intact adults. A cross-sectional design was used with four groups (n=17 each): (1) Low Risk/Low PA; (2) Low Risk/High PA; (3) High Risk/Low PA; and (4) High Risk/High PA. PA level was based on self-reported frequency and intensity. AD risk was based on presence or absence of an APOE-ε4 allele. Brain activation was measured using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants performed a famous name discrimination task. Brain activation subserving semantic memory processing occurred in 15 functional regions of interest. High PA and High Risk were associated with significantly greater semantic memory activation (famous > unfamiliar) in 6 and 3 of the 15 regions, respectively. Significant interactions of PA and Risk were evident in 9 of 15 brain regions, with the High PA/High Risk group demonstrating greater semantic memory activation than the remaining three groups. These findings suggest that PA selectively increases memory-related brain activation in cognitively intact but genetically at-risk elders. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether increased semantic memory processing in physically active at-risk individuals is protective against future cognitive decline. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

NeuroImage , Volume 53, Issue 4, December 2010, Pages 1244-1255 
 
Abstract 
Imaging studies of cerebral volumes often adjust for factors such as age that may confound between-subject comparisons. However the use of nuisance covariates in imaging studies is inconsistent, which can make interpreting results across studies difficult. Using magnetic resonance images of 78 healthy controls we assessed the effects of age, gender, head size and scanner upgrade on region of interest (ROI) volumetry, cortical thickness and voxel-based morphometric (VBM) measures. We found numerous significant associations between these variables and volumetric measures: cerebral volumes and cortical thicknesses decreased with increasing age, men had larger volumes and smaller thicknesses than women, and increasing head size was associated with larger volumes. The relationships between most ROIs and head size volumes were non-linear. With age, gender, head size and upgrade in one model we found that volumes and thicknesses decreased with increasing age, women had larger volumes than men (VBM, whole-brain and white matter volumes), increasing head size was associated with larger volumes but not cortical thickness, and scanner upgrade had an effect on thickness and some volume measures. The effects of gender on cortical thickness when adjusting for head size, age and upgrade showed some non-significant effect (women > men), whereas the independent effect of head size showed little pattern. We conclude that age and head size should be considered in ROI volume studies, age, gender and upgrade should be considered for cortical thickness studies and all variables require consideration for VBM analyses. Division of all volumes by head size is unlikely to be adequate owing to their non-proportional relationship. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Behavioural Brain Research , Volume 215, Issue 2, December 2010, Pages 172-179 
 
Abstract 
One of the crucial issues in actual research on memory disorders and particularly in Alzheimer's disease is the development of behavioral tasks accurately testing episodic memory, a type of memory sensitive to aging and altered early during neurodegenerative disorders. Translational research allowing comparison of similar memory properties between human and rodent models is a requirement for the finding of behavioral and cognitive biomarkers as well as molecular deficits associated to the pathology. In this review, we propose that the ability to remember an ordered sequence of choices during spatial navigation could be one of the episodic memory properties shared by human and rodent models. The ability to learn the correct sequence of choices depends on the hippocampus, requires flexibility and is particularly sensitive to age-related decline in rodents as in humans. In an innovative approach, we took advantage of a well characterized rodent navigation task, the starmaze, to develop a new model of episodic allowing creating and objective experimental testing of a personal past experience without requiring verbal report which can be transferred to human. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract 
Although motor problems such as parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia, tremor, or gait impairment are generally the predominant characteristics of diseases categorized as ‘movement disorders,’ dementia forms a core element or an accompanying feature in several movement disorders. Recently, there has been greater recognition of the importance of nonmotor features such as cognitive impairment in movement disorders. This article reviews select movement disorders associated with dementia or cognitive impairment.

Abstract 
Now regarded as part of a ‘Lewy body spectrum,’ dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by a dysexecutive-visuoperceptual dementia frequently accompanied by visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention, and Parkinsonism. Strategic α-synuclein aggregates, neuronal loss, and variable degrees of amyloid deposition constitute the key pathological features. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features of DLB may respond well to cholinesterase inhibitor drugs.

Abstract 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Early concepts looking at PD as purely a motor disorder have led the way to seeing it as a much more widespread neurological disease with affective, cognitive, and autonomic manifestations. 
 
The etiology of PD is still unknown, but important steps have been made to understand its pathogenesis. To a large extent, these derived from the identification of genetic variants of PD. Mutations in several genes have been discovered that cause monogenic PD. 
 
Several drugs are now available for the treatment of PD patients. These include drugs specifically aimed at motor symptomatology (levodopa, dopamine agonists, and amantadine) and agents for treatment of cognitive, affective, and autonomic manifestations. Levodopa is undoubtedly the most efficacious agent to treat the motor dysfunction, but it has short-term and long-term adverse events, limiting its use. Therefore, treatment of the initial stages of PD usually starts with dopamine agonists or with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Anticholinergic drugs, once the mainstay therapy of PD, are now rarely used, except for the control of tremor. 
 
As the motor symptoms are relatively efficiently controlled, the nonmotor symptoms of PD become the main problem in the management of PD patients. Therapy for cognitive impairment and for depression is available, but there is need to develop newer and more efficacious therapies.
