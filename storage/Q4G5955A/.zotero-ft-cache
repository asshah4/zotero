Traditional and Nonlinear HRV and Mortality. Introduction: Decreased heart rate variability
(HRV) and abnormal nonlinear HRV shortly after myocardial infarction (MI) are risk factors for mortality. Traditional HRV predicts mortality in patients with a range of times post-MI, but the association of nonlinear HRV and outcome in this population is unknown.
Methods and Results: HRV was determined from 740 tapes recorded before antiarrhythmic therapy in Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial patients with ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) suppressed on the ﬁrst randomized treatment. Patients were 70 ± 121 days post-MI. Follow up was 362 ± 241 days (70 deaths). The association between traditional time and frequency-domain HRV and mortality and nonlinear HRV and mortality were compared for the entire population (ALL), those without coronary artery bypass graft post-MI (no CABG), and those without CABG or diabetes (no CABG, no DIAB) using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Strength of association was compared by P values and Wald Chisquare values. Nonlinear HRV included short-term fractal scaling exponent, power law slope, and SD12 (Poincare´ dimension). For ALL and for no CABG, increased daytime SD12 had the strongest association with mortality (P = 0.002 ALL and P < 0.001 no CABG). For no CABG, no DIAB increased 24-hour SD12 hours had the strongest association (P < 0.001) with mortality. Upon multivariate analysis, increased SD12, decreased ln ULF (ultra low frequency), and history of prior MI and history of congestive heart failure each remained in the model.
Conclusion: Nonlinear HRV is associated with mortality post-MI. However, as with traditional HRV, this is diluted by CABG surgery post-MI and by diabetes. Results suggest that decreased long-term HRV and increased randomness of heart rate are each independent risk factors for mortality post-MI.

heart rate variability, ambulatory ECG, postmyocardial infarction, risk factors

Introduction
Beginning in 1987 with the results of the Multi-Center Post-Infarction Project (MPIP) and numerous subsequent trials, it has been clearly demonstrated that traditional timedomain and frequency-domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV) measured in the peri-infarction period identify postmyocardial infarction (post-MI) patients at increased risk for mortality.1-13 Recently, techniques from nonlinear dynamics have been applied to peri-infarction patients. The index power law slope was applied to the MPIP data and found to be a better predictor of mortality than any time- or frequency-domain HRV index.14 In other studies, the short-term fractal scaling exponent was a better predictor of mortality than traditional HRV measures.15,16 Thus, limited data suggest that nonlinear HRV may provide superior risk stratiﬁcation to traditional HRV post-MI.
In risk stratiﬁcation studies, HRV almost always is measured in the peri-infarction period. Time- and frequency-

domain HRV are known to increase in many patients during recovery from MI.17 The predictive value of HRV measured at a later time is less clear. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS), the pilot study for the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), reported that HRV measured in the frequency domain 1 year post-MI continues to predict mortality during an approximately 2-year follow-up.12
CAST was an historic post-MI study of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction and high-grade ventricular arrhythmias that were suppressed by class IC drugs. Holter recordings were obtained at a large range of times postMI. We previously reported that time-domain indices of HRV, such as SDNN (standard deviation of all normal-to-normal interbeat intervals), which are strong predictors of mortality in the peri-infarction period, were not associated with mortality when the entire CAST group was taken together.18 However, after patients with diabetes and/or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery post-MI were excluded from the analysis, decreased SDNN was strongly associated with mortality (P = 0.006). Similarly, in the frequency domain, when patients with diabetes or CABG post-MI were excluded, as was the case with peri-infarction post-MI studies,2 decreased ln total power (P < 0.001) and decreased ln ultra low frequency power (P < 0.001) had the strongest associations with mortality.
In the current investigation, we compared the association with all-cause mortality in the CAST of 24-hour, daytime,

14 Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology Vol. 16, No. 1, January 2005

and nighttime nonlinear HRV indices: power law slope, SD12 (sometimes called the Poincare´ dimension), and short-term fractal scaling exponent, with previously computed associations for standard time- and frequency-domain HRV. Because of the confounding effect of including patients with CABG post-MI and diabetes on the association of traditional HRV and mortality, these associations were again determined for the entire dataset, excluding CABG post-MI and excluding both CABG and diabetes. Finally, the independent association of traditional and nonlinear HRV with mortality was determined.
Methods
Patient Population
The primary goal of CAST was to determine the effects of suppression of ventricular premature beats on mortality after myocardial infarction.19 Enrollment required an acute MI within the preceding 2 years and ≥6 ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) per hour on the pretreatment (qualifying) Holter recording. Those who enrolled within 90 days of the index MI were required to have ejection fractions ≤55%, whereas those enrolled after the 90-day window were required to have an ejection fraction ≤40%. After qualiﬁcation, patients were randomly assigned to encainide, moricizine, or ﬂecainide, with ﬂecainide omitted in the subgroup with the lowest ejection fraction. Patients who had signiﬁcant suppression of ventricular premature beats with a particular agent were continued on that agent or placebo. More complete information on study design can be found in the primary endpoint reports.20-22 In April 1989, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board of CAST recommended that the encainide and ﬂecainide arms of the study be discontinued, and CAST II was begun. Patients in CAST I who were taking moricizine were continued on that agent, and additional patients were selected who were believed to be at higher risk than those in CAST I. CAST II required an ejection fraction ≤40% and required patients to be ≤90 days post-MI.
Baseline, pretreatment (qualifying), and on-therapy (suppression) tapes from participants in CAST I and CAST II were obtained from the CAST data coordinating center. CAST enrolled 3,549 patients. Patients (N = 830) were selected from the CAST database based on their being coded as having usable qualifying and suppression tapes. The patients had their arrhythmias successfully suppressed on their ﬁrst, randomly assigned antiarrhythmic treatment, and they were continued on that agent. However, only pretreatment recordings were analyzed in the current study. Tapes with atrial ﬁbrillation (N = 27) or paced rhythm (N = 9) were eliminated from this analysis. Some tapes proved to be missing. For 24-hour analyses, tapes with <12 hours of 5-minute segments with adequate data, or other technical problems, were excluded. For daytime (08:00–20:00) or nighttime (00:00–06:00) analyses, tapes with <50% of daytime or nighttime periods with acceptable 5-minutes segments were excluded. For the timedomain analyses, at least 50% of intervals in each usable 5-minute segment had to consist of normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. For the frequency-domain and nonlinear analyses, which are more sensitive to missing data, the acceptance threshold for a usable segment was 80% N-N intervals. After tapes that were not usable for any of the analyses were excluded, 740 (70 deaths) remained. Also, 263 patients with

usable tapes subsequently were randomized to encainide, 207 to ﬂecainide, and 270 to moricizine.
Clinical and Demographic Data
Clinical and demographic data for each patient were provided by the CAST coordinating center. Characteristics of the CAST patient population and the procedures for data validation have been previously reported.20-22
Subgroup Analyses
Associations with mortality from the baseline recordings were determined for the entire CAST population, for those without CABG surgery post-MI, and for those who were both nondiabetic and without CABG surgery post-MI.
Analysis of HRV
All tapes were scanned on a Marquette SXP Laser Holter scanner (Milwaukee, WI, software version 5.8) by an experienced research Holter technician using standard Holter analysis procedures. Speciﬁcally, attention was paid to accurate and consistent detection of beat onsets. Misdetected beats were excluded from the analysis. Also, the longest and shortest true normal-to-normal intervals were identiﬁed for each recording in order to exclude all beats outside this range from the HRV analysis. Intervals within this range were carefully edited. Beat-stream ﬁles, representing the time and classiﬁcation of each QRS complex, were transferred to a Sun Sparcstation computer (Sun Microsystems, Santa Clara, CA) where secondary editing and HRV analysis were performed using previously reported and validated techniques.23,24
Calculations of time- and frequency-domain HRV were performed according to standard methods that were previously described.25 Indices were grouped as longer-term, i.e., quantifying variations in heart rate over >5-minute period (primarily circadian rhythms); intermediate-term, i.e., quantifying variations in heart rate over <5-minute periods; and short-term, i.e., quantifying beat-to-beat changes in heart rate. Deﬁnitions for these time- and frequency-domain indices are given in Table 1.
Nonlinear HRV Indices
Whereas time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV capture the amount of HRV at various time scales, nonlinear HRV measures attempt to capture the structure or complexity of the heart rate time series. For example, a random series of heart beats, a normal series of heart beats, and a totally periodic series of heart beats might have the exact same standard deviation (SDNN), but their underlying organization would be completely different.
Power law slope
In normal sinus rhythm, spectral power, when measured over 24 hours, shows a progressive, virtually exponential increase in amplitude with decreasing frequency. This also can be plotted as the log of power versus the log of frequency, which transforms the exponential curve to a line whose slope can be measured.14 The power law slope is the slope of this line, measured between 10−2 and 10−4 Hz, and is a negative number. It is believe to reﬂect the degree to which the patterns of the heart rate time series are self-similar over a scale of minutes to hours.14 Decreased power law slope has

been shown to be a marker for increased risk of mortality post-MI.14
SD12
The nonlinear index SD12 quantiﬁes the shape of the Poincare´ plot, a ﬁgure in which each R-R interval is plotted against the previous one. As shown in Figure 1, the Poincare´ plot is a graphic representation of the underlying patterns in the heart rate time series. SD12 is the ratio of the lengths of the axes of an imaginary ellipse that has its center at the average R-R interval of the time series and is ﬁtted to the Poincare´ plot. The long axis of this ellipse is along a line beginning at the origin and with a slope of 1 and has a length called SD2.

SD2 reﬂects intermediate-term variability. The length of the transverse axis of the ellipse is SD1 and reﬂects short-term variability. SD12 is the ratio of these measures and can be considered an intermediate-term nonlinear measure. For this analysis, SD12 was calculated for 1,000 beat segments and averaged.26 Points where the change in the difference in NN between adjacent pairs of N-N intervals was >30% were excluded.
Increased SD12 often reﬂects a more scattered, abnormal Poincare´ plot. The insets in Figure 1 show examples of abnormal and normal SD12 and their associated 1-hour Poincare´ plots taken from the CAST dataset. Figure 1a and 1b are abnormal plots, with high values of SD12 from nonsurvivors

DFA1
Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis provides a quantitative method for determining the degree to which a time series is random at the one extreme and correlated at the other. DFA1 ranges in value from 0.5 (random) to 1.5 (correlated), with normal values of just over 1.0. Decreased DFA1 (also called alpha 1) has been associated with adverse outcomes in cardiac patient populations.16 The details of this method have been described elsewhere.27-29 Only N-N intervals were used for this calculation. DFA1 can be considered a short-term nonlinear measure.
Statistical Analyses
Indices of HRV were tested for normality and natural log transformation applied, when necessary, to provide a normal distribution appropriate for parametric statistical comparisons. Univariate prediction of all-cause mortality for each potential predictor variable was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. A stepwise Cox proportional

hazards regression analysis was used to determine the independent clinical and HRV predictors of mortality.

Comparison of the Association of Nonlinear and Standard Indices of HRV with Mortality for the Entire CAST Group
Table 3 lists the HRV indices most strongly associated with mortality (P < 0.01) in the CAST group taken as a whole. Using the Wald Chi-square (essentially the square of the t-statistic) and the P value as surrogates for the strength of association with mortality, it can be seen that among HRV indices calculated over 24 hours, the nonlinear indices SD12 and power law slope (both P = 0.002) had the strongest association with mortality. Surprisingly, when HRV was computed during the daytime only, the association of HRV with mortality sharply increased for SD12 (P < 0.001). Thus, increased daytime values of SD12 had the strongest association with mortality in the CAST. Also, as previously reported, the frequency-domain index increased normalized high frequency (HF) was a similarly strong predictor of mortality (P = 0.001) when calculated during the daytime.17
Comparison of the Association of Nonlinear and Standard Indices of HRV with Mortality When Patients with CABG Surgery after the Qualifying MI Were Excluded
We previously reported that standard HRV indices were depressed in patients with CABG surgery after their MI.30 Comparison of nonlinear HRV indices for those with and without CABG showed a similar phenomenon, with more abnormal values in those with CABG surgery. These included signiﬁcant increases in SD12 (P < 0.001), decreases in DFA1 (P < 0.001), and decreases in power law slope (P = 0.020). Comparison of Tables 3 and 4 shows the increased association

of standard and nonlinear HRV with mortality when patients with CABG surgery post-MI were excluded from the analysis. Because the total number of subjects and deaths was smaller in this subset, all things being equal, the association of HRV and mortality would be expected to decrease. However, this association became stronger for every index. Among indices calculated over 24 hours, the nonlinear HRV indices SD12 and power law slope (both P < 0.001) continued to have the strongest association with mortality. The stronger association of daytime HRV and mortality persisted, with increased daytime values for SD12 and decreased values for DFA1 each (despite the smaller number of qualifying recordings and deaths) more strongly associated with mortality than 24-hour values.
As we previously reported, 24-hour and daytime longer and intermediate-term frequency-domain HRV became signiﬁcantly associated with mortality once CABG patients were excluded.17 Whereas decreased 24-hour SDNN, SDANN, and ln SDNNIDX were each signiﬁcantly associated with mortality (n = 596, 63 deaths, P < 0.05), P values were >0.01 and results were not included in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, frequency-domain HRV indices had a far stronger association with mortality than time-domain indices, even though they were based on a smaller sample size. Decreased ln ULF (ultra low frequency) over 24 hours was strongly associated with mortality (P < 0.001), and increased normalized HF power during the daytime had the second strongest association with mortality of all the HRV indices. Also, after patients with CABG post-MI were excluded, HRV calculated during the nighttime became significantly associated with mortality, although this association was relatively weak.

Comparison of the Association of Nonlinear and Standard
Indices of HRV with Mortality for the Group Without
Diabetes or CABG Surgery after the Qualifying MI
We previously showed that standard HRV indices were decreased in CAST patients with diabetes.30 When nonlinear HRV was compared between diabetics and nondiabetics, they too were more adverse in diabetics. SD12 was signiﬁcantly higher and DFA1 and power law slope signiﬁcantly lower among diabetics (all P < 0.001). However, neither standard nor nonlinear HRV indices were associated with mortality among diabetic patients in the CAST. Table 5 compares the association of different HRV indices with mortality when both CABG patients and diabetics were excluded from the analysis. Among 24-hour HRV indices, after diabetic patients were excluded, increased SD12 had the strongest association with mortality, and the association with mortality of power law slope weakened. Daytime nonlinear HRV (DFA1 and SD12) remained strongly associated with mortality, but this association was not stronger than for those indices calculated over 24 hours.
Also, as previously reported, despite the smaller number of patients and events, removing diabetics also increased the association with mortality of most longer-term time- and frequency-domain HRV.17 Among 24-hour indices, ln TP and ln ULF had the strongest association with mortality of the standard HRV indices (P < 0.001 for each). Increased normalized HF during the daytime remained strongly associated with mortality (P = 0.001). HRV calculated during the nighttime had a stronger association with mortality when diabetic patients also were excluded but remained weaker than either daytime or 24-hour indices.

Independent Predictors of Mortality
Using Cox regression analysis, we identiﬁed the cutpoint of 24-hour SD12 that best separated nonsurvivors and survivors in the group without CABG or diabetes. At the best cutpoint, SD12 = 0.55, mortality was 53% among the 15 patients with the highest values and 6.7% among the 351 with lower values. Figure 2 shows Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients above and below the cutpoint for SD12.
Because ln ULF and SD12 each reﬂect totally different aspects of HRV, we determined if they were independent predictors of mortality by putting them both into the Cox model. Both were retained (SD12: Wald Chi-square = 8.35, P = 0.004; ln ULF: Wald Chi-square = 11.8, P = 0.001). We previously demonstrated that, among the group that excluded CABG and diabetes, decreased 24-hour ln ULF remained in the Cox model when history of prior MI or history of congestive heart failure, the two clinical factors most strongly associated with mortality (P < 0.001), were added. We performed a similar analysis including these clinical factors with both ln ULF and SD12 in the Cox regression analysis. Each factor was retained in the ﬁnal model, which included ln ULF (Wald Chi-square = 9.67, P = 0.002), SD12 (Wald Chi-square = 6.94, P = 0.008), history of MI (Wald Chi-square = 9.38, P = 0.002), and history of congestive heart failure (Wald Chi-square = 5.27, P = 0.022).

Discussion
Results suggest that traditional and nonlinear HRV indices capture different aspects of increased risk for mortality postMI. Traditional HRV risk stratiﬁers (total and ultra low frequency power and SDNN) capture longer-term, primarily circadian trends in HRV. Reduction in these has been clearly associated with increased mortality in the peri-infarction period and in CAST. The nonlinear HRV indices SD12 and DFA1 capture the randomness of R-R dynamics. Both decreased DFA1 and increased SD12 were associated with worse survival in CAST. Consistent with this ﬁnding, the other index strongly associated with worse survival was increased daytime normalized HF, i.e., increased relative HF power. Increased HF power can result from either increased vagal control of heart rate or increased beat-to-beat randomness. We speculate that increased normalized HF power represents nonrespiratory sinus arrhythmia rather than increased vagal modulation of heart rate. Thus, the consistent association of increased short-term HRV (including time-domain indices) with mortality supports the hypothesis that increased nonrespiratory beat-to-beat HRV indicates a worse prognosis. Furthermore, this explains why increased short-term HRV, usually hypothesized to reﬂect vagal modulation of heart rate, has not been associated with better survival.
The mechanism for increased short-term randomness of heart rate is unclear. Potentially, it could be due to sinus nodal

dysfunction resulting in abrupt, random prolongations of sinus intervals. Alternatively, a study of normal volunteers has shown that increasing doses of norepinephrine result in a similar R-R interval behavior, such as abrupt prolongations in R-R intervals that are not related to respiration and result in increased SD12 and altered short-term fractal HR behavior (decreased DFA1).31,32 Similarly, Woo et al.33 showed that elevated levels of circulating norepinephrine are associated with complex Poincare´ plots among heart failure patients. Although SD12 was not calculated in that study, complex Poincare´ plots, as shown, for example, in Figures 1a and b, have a relative increase in SD1 and often a decrease in SD2 that results in markedly increased SD12 values. Together, these ﬁndings support the hypothesis that increased random beat-to-beat HR dynamics is a marker for sympathoexcitation and thereby is associated with an increased risk for mortality.
For both traditional and now nonlinear HRV, however, the association with mortality appears to be weakened by the inclusion of patients with CABG surgery post-MI or with diabetes. Longer-term HRV is markedly reduced (by 69% of no CABG in CAST) in patient with recent CABG surgery.30 It has become clear that this reduction persists for many months.34 We now have shown that adverse changes in HRV among CABG patients also are seen in nonlinear indices. Thus, the variables most strongly associated with mortality post-MI are markedly decreased (or, in the case of SD12, increased) in a population (19% in CAST) that has better, rather than worse, short-term survival. Results are consistent with a study of patients immediately before and after CABG surgery in which similar changes in nonlinear HRV were observed.26 Furthermore, increased SD12 on postoperative day 1 was the most powerful independent predictor of postoperative ischemia.35 Similarly, both traditional and nonlinear HRV are adversely affected in diabetics, but this may be a result of the diabetes and is not, at least in the CAST, associated with risk of mortality post-MI. Thus, exclusion of these two confounding groups may improve the potential for HRV to aid in risk stratiﬁcation of a post-MI clinical population.

This is the ﬁrst study we are aware of that used SD12 for risk stratiﬁcation in a large patient sample. Concurrent with present ﬁndings, a previous study showed that an increase in SD12 speciﬁcally precedes the onset of life-threatening arrhythmias in post-MI patients.36 In the CAST population, SD12 proved to have a stronger association with mortality than either DFA1 or power law slope, the two nonlinear indices previously associated with mortality post-MI.14,16 Moreover, rather than examining the shapes of 24-hour R-R interval plots, we have calculated averaged SD12 for each 1,000 beats from normal-to-normal interbeat intervals only. A beneﬁt of this index in risk stratiﬁcation is that it combines two obvious abnormalities in HR behavior, i.e., decreased intermediate-term variability and increased short-term beatto-beat variability, although, importantly, the combination of decreased ln ULF and increased SD12 was more powerful than SD12 alone for predicting mortality. Another beneﬁt of this method is that calculation of SD12 is relatively easy.
Although it is unclear whether the reduced number of subjects and events for those recordings eligible for daytime analysis (26 daytime vs 32 for 24 hours) explains why the stronger association with mortality of daytime nonlinear HRV indices compared to 24-hour indices was no longer seen when diabetics also were excluded from the analysis, our results suggest that 24-hour HRV may not always be the best measure for risk stratiﬁcation purposes. It could be that daytime HRV, which is inﬂuenced by both autonomic function and activity,37 is a better reﬂection of certain aspects of patient status, much as exercise-based values for many cardiovascular parameters are more useful than resting values. The effect on HRV of increased randomness on the heart rate signal may be more prominent during the daytime when vagal modulation of HR is normally low, and there may be more bursts of sympathetic activation resulting in an increase in random HR behavior. Also, HRV during the nighttime may be exaggerated by conditions such as sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances that could confound the association with mortality.
Limitations to the generalizability of the present study must be noted. First, post-MI therapy has changed since the time of the CAST trial. Although 31% of CAST patients had thrombolytic therapy and 18% underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, speciﬁc results must be validated in a population receiving current therapy. However, it must be noted that traditional and nonlinear HRV have continued to predict mortality post-MI even in the modern era.11 Second, although the current study was based on pretreatment HRV, the CAST population was selected for its high prevalence of ventricular ectopy and subsequently randomized to three different antiarrhythmic therapies that are no longer generally used in post-MI patients. However, in this subset of patients, the signiﬁcant difference in mortality between patients later treated with encainide and ﬂecainide compared to moricizine was not seen, so treatment assignment did not inﬂuence mortality. Also, the mean time from MI to Holter was 70 days, and patients had to undergone both a qualifying and suppression recording to be enrolled in CAST, so many higher-risk patients died before they entered the study. Thus, our sample, although based on the ﬁrst recording, included only patients who survived to the second CAST recording and whose arrhythmias could be suppressed on the ﬁrst antiarrhythmic treatment. Also, the endpoint was all-cause mortality, so no estimate can be made of the degree to which HRV is associated with arrhythmic mortality. However, because of the increasing importance of

implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillators, risk stratiﬁcation of post-MI patients has gained greater urgency. Thus, the potential clinical applicability of our approach to patients in a clinical setting, in whom HRV can be measured beyond the peri-infarction period, should be tested in patients receiving current therapy. In addition, the ability of the combination of traditional and nonlinear HRV to risk stratify, with and without patients with diabetes or CABG post-MI excluded, can be validated in other already collected post-MI datasets.
