Abstract 
The ability to hear and recognize vocalizations of others has enabled mammals to develop sophisticated communication systems. The study of neural mechanisms underlying audio-vocal integration has shown that auditory feedback may be used for updating internal representations of mappings between voice feedback and speech motor control. Work on humans and animals have shown that auditory feedback operates reflexively to stabilize voice fundamental frequency (F 0 ) in vocalization, speech and song. Although precise neural networks of the corrective motor adjustments are still unknown, preliminary processing of auditory feedback takes place in the auditory cortex and posterior parts of the superior temporal gyrus. Comparison of voice feedback and formulation of the corrected vocal response may take place in the frontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsal premotor cortex. The inferior frontal gyrus may be involved in the generation of vocalizations and efference copy back to the auditory cortex.
