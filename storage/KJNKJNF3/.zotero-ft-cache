Abstract 
Cerebrovascular disease can be devastating for patients and their families. However, there is much that can be done to attenuate cerebral damage and reduce the extent of any disability. Active intervention is best seen in three phases: acute therapy, rehabilitation and secondary prevention. Thrombolysis within 3 hours of symptom onset substantially reduces morbidity from ischaemic stroke. Administration requires the use of clear protocols to triage, transport and investigate patients without delay. The concept of a ‘chain of survival’ for ‘acute brain attack’ is paramount. The acute management of haemorrhagic stroke remains an area of active research. Computerized tomography is the preferred imaging technique in the early assessment of most stroke patients. An organized approach to stroke care, provided in a specialist environment, reduces disability and saves lives. Such care has many components and it is not known which elements confer benefit. Secondary prevention should be considered in all patients presenting with stroke and transient ischaemic attack. Validated tools have been developed for the estimation of recurrence risk in the individual. Assessment of the carotid arteries should be carried out urgently as the efficacy of surgical endarterectomy falls with time. Warfarin therapy may be safer in the elderly population with atrial fibrillation than is often assumed.

Abstract 
Ischaemic stroke causes loss of brain function in millions of people worldwide each year. Despite the enormity of the problem, no currently approved therapy reduces stroke size or neurological disability. This contrasts with a number of recently developed agents, reviewed here by Walter Koroshetz and Michael Moskowitz . which limit infarct size in animal stroke models. Therapies that dissolve clot and restore blood flow, block excitatory neurotransmission, prevent the ischaemic inflammatory response or scavange free radicals have the potential to revolutionize stroke treatment if proven beneficial in ongoing, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Developments in the experimental arena continue to reinforce the need to characterize the pathophysiological stages leading to brain infarction and recovery.

Abstract 
Substantial efforts are being made to develop drugs which will protect the brain from the neurodegeneration that follows an acute ischaemic stroke. However, while there are already a significant number of animal models of stroke, there is currently no information as to whether activity of a compound in any of them will predict clinical efficacy. In this article, Jackie Hunter, Richard Green and Alan Cross review the major models of acute cerebral ischaemia and propose rational protocols for examining novel neuroprotective agents.

European Journal of Pharmacology , Volume 649, Issues 1-3, December 2010, Pages 92-99 
 
Abstract 
Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion can activate several transcription factors and lead to inflammatory reactions, which related to pattern recognition receptors with immune activating functions. NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2) is one of the receptors involved in innate immune response and is genetically associated with several inflammatory reactions. Since baicalin has the pharmacological effects of anti-inflammation and protection of brain from cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, we studied baicalin's effect on NOD2/TNFα in the cell of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro and the mice of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in vivo. The results showed that NOD2 and TNFα were up regulated in the cells with oxygen-glucose deprivation, not only in BV2 cells, but also in both of PC12 cells and primary neuron cells, which suggested NOD2 could express directly in neuron while OGD treatment. Baicalin (10μg/ml) could effectively down regulate the expression of NOD2 and TNFα in both mRNA and protein levels. Meanwhile, baicalin (50. mg/kg, i.p.) could also down regulate the expression of NOD2 and TNFα in protein levels significantly, in which agreed with its effect in vitro study. These data demonstrated that targeting on NOD2 especially in neurons directly was possibly attributed to the neural-protective effect of baicalin in the injury of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental Neurology , Volume 226, Issue 1, November 2010, Pages 183-190 
 
Abstract 
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown after stroke is linked to the up-regulation of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inflammation. This study examines the effects of progesterone (PROG) and its neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO) on BBB integrity following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Rats underwent pMCAO by electro-coagulation and received intraperitoneal injections of PROG (8. mg/kg), ALLO (8. mg/kg) or vehicle at 1. h post-occlusion and then subcutaneous injections (8. mg/kg) at 6, 24, and 48. h. MMP activation and expression were analyzed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and gelatin zymography 72. h post-pMCAO. Occludin1, claudin5, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were analyzed at 72. h post-pMCAO with Western blots. BBB permeability was measured by Evans blue extravasation and infarct size was evaluated by cresyl violet at 72. h after pMCAO. Ischemic injury significantly (p< 0.05) increased the expression of MMP-9, MMP-2, TNF-α and IL-6, and reduced the levels of occludin1 and claudin5. These changes were followed by increased infarct size (% contralateral hemisphere) and Evans blue extravasation into the brain indicating compromise of the BBB. PROG and ALLO attenuated BBB disruption and infarct size following pMCAO by reducing MMPs and the inflammatory response and by preventing the degradation of occludin1 and claudin5. We conclude that PROG and ALLO can help to protect BBB disruption following pMCAO. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Relationship between leukocyte kinetics and behavioral tests changes in the inflammatory process of hemorrhagic stroke recovery 
International Journal of Neuroscience , Volume 120, Issue 12, November 2010, Pages 765-773 
 
Abstract 
In this study, we investigated the inflammatory response to hemorrhagic stroke (HS) as the main mechanism of brain functional recovery. Sprague-Dawley rats (n 24) underwent surgery with sterile saline (control group, n 12) and collagenase IV-S (stroke group, n 12) being injected into the right striatum. White blood cell analysis, histological and immunohistological examination of the brain slices, as well as densitometric analysis of polymorphonuclear and microglial cells/macrophages were correlated with behavioral tests, and the data were subjected to appropriate statistical processing. The results indicate a strong correlation between polymorphonuclear and mononuclear changes in the blood and the zone of hemorrhagic stroke with behavioral tests of functional brain recovery. We propose that the inflammatory response is determined by kinetics of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells in both the blood and the hemorrhagic stroke zone. Kinetics of these cells is followed by the restoration of functions, and the maximum functional recovery is observed by the time polymorphonuclear and mononuclear stages have completed. With the development of inflammation and leukocyte kinetics, it is possible to predict functional recovery of hemorrhagic stroke. Improvement of the degree and rate of hemorrhagic stroke functional recovery may be achieved by therapeutic interventions into the inflammatory mechanisms influencing polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell kinetics. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Abstract 
The anatomy and physiology of the cerebral cortex in adult mammals is adaptive and can be altered over the course of hours to days to weeks based on behavioral demands. In the motor cortex, as new motor skills are learned, cellular and network organization is altered to accommodate the new function. Similarly, after injury, as might occur in stroke, the remaining motor cortical network undergoes extensive changes in an apparent attempt to recover lost functions. Several new interventional approaches to improve recovery are now being developed and are based primarily on our growing knowledge about underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms.
