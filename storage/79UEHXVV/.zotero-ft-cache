TESOL QUARTERLY

In This Issue

With this issue, the TESOL Quarterly completes its 20th year of publication. Readers will find articles dealing with the teaching of writing, the teaching of grammar, and methodology in second language research— topics of traditional concern to our field. Other articles address issues which have become especially prominent, particularly in recent years— functional, competency-based teaching in refugee education and orality and literacy. Individually and together, the articles reflect the tradition in our field of searching for multiple and interdisciplinary perspectives on topics of interest and exploring new issues and challenges in the context of our accumulated knowledge and experience.
May Shih presents a rationale for “content-based approaches to teaching academic writing—in which writing is linked to concurrent study of specific subject matter in one or more academic disciplines.” Shih contrasts content-based approaches with traditional approaches (pattern centered, functional, and process centered) and argues that “content-based academic writing instruction may be . . . more effective . . . because it deals with writing in a manner similar (or identical) to how writing is assigned, prepared for, and reacted to in real academic courses.” The article includes extensive description of five frameworks for implementing content-based academic writing instruction for learners who have more than elementary proficiency in English.
James Tollefson describes problems in the functional, competencybased curricula developed for the U.S. Refugee Processing Centers in Southeast Asia. Since 1980, approximately 150,000 refugees have completed the intensive program in ESL, cultural orientation, and preemployment training off ered at these centers. Tollefson argues that although unprecedented funds have been spent on overseas refugee education, a number of fundamental problems persist in this program. He describes problems in the curriculum development process, in the role of values in the curriculum, and in the validation of tests of functional competence. The article concludes with a call for critical examination of all of these issues, as they relate both to the work of the U.S. Refugee Program and to the functional, competency-based approach to curriculum development in general.

• Jeanette DeCarrico argues that a major problem in teaching the
English modality system stems from a failure of ESL grammar texts to make clear the past time relationships expressed by modal perfect forms (modal + have + participle). DeCarrico’s article stresses the need for instruction on these forms to explain “the systematic nature of the forms and of the semantics with respect to time relationships.” According to the author, the simplest and most accurate explanation is that “modals in past contexts are normally restricted to one time frame, in terms of actual time . . . the definite, or simple, past time.” This explanation underscores the point that modal perfects bear no relation semantically to the past time frame of present perfect forms. The article includes a five-step sequence for teaching the English modality system; this sequence reflects the author’s emphasis on the “need to distinguish clearly between tense and aspect as opposed to actual time.”
• For several years, TESOL’s Research Interest Section, continuing a
tradition begun by its predecessor, the Research Committee, has presented a state-of-the-art session at each TESOL Convention. The Quarterly is pleased to publish revised versions of the contributions to the 1985 session, the topic of which was research methodology. The intention is to promote further the goals of the session: to examine current practice in research design and analysis and to stimulate discussion of how research on second language development should be conducted in the future.
In her introduction, Miriam Eisenstein, who organized the session, summarizes the case for research alternatives. Eisenstein’s comments focus on the effectiveness of different approaches in investigating different problems and issues; she takes the position that alternative methods of data collection and analysis can complement one another.
A two-pronged approach, involving systematic observation and controlled elicitation, is viewed by Nessa Wolfson as a necessity in research on rules of speaking in a specific speech community. Wolfson discusses a number of methodological problems in sociolinguistic research—the “observer’s paradox,” the unreliability of subjects’ intuitions about their speech behavior, and the “tendency to forget the context in which speech was produced and to collapse data from studies in which the speech events were quite different.” In addition, she illustrates the hypothesis-generating potential of systematic observation by summarizing her own and others’ research on “how people use their linguistic resources to negotiate within the social structure of which they are a part.”
Grant Henning discusses the current state of quantitative research on language acquisition—research which he defines as involving “the tallying, manipulation, or systematic aggregation of quantities of data.” Henning’s analysis of articles published in the TESOL Quarterly and

614

TESOL QUARTERLY

Language Learning at 5-year intervals beginning with 1970 reveals that while the percentage of quantitative research has increased dramatically, the percentage of quantitative research involving formal hypothesis testing has declined. In Henning’s view, a widespread problem in quantitative research in applied linguistics is the failure of “experiments” to state a formal hypothesis and to satisfy other fundamental requirements of experimental research (such as estimating the reliability and validity of instrumentation and procedures). The article concludes with suggestions to guide future research, with particular emphasis on studies involving small samples.
Craig Chaudron contends that “research in and about L2 classrooms illustrates the interdependence, in fact the virtually inseparable application, of qualitative and quantitative approaches.” He summarizes the interaction of product- and process-oriented approaches to classroom research since the 1960s, arguing that the pattern of development in this research involves “qualitative refinement of the relevant categories and quantitative analysis of the extent of relevance.” The variable of teacher questioning behavior is used to illustrate the need for “a continued program of qualitative refinement and quantitative testing” to determine what aspects of learning tasks are affected by differences in a classroom interaction variable and what effects these differences produce.
• James Gee’s review article aims to place the “literacy crisis” in a crosscultural perspective. By reviewing key works on orality and literacy, Gee traces the progression of critical thought toward the view that literacy has different social and cognitive consequences in different social contexts. He stresses that teachers of English must see themselves not simply as teaching language, but rather as “teaching a set of discourse practices, oral and written, connected with the standard dialect of English.” According to Gee, we must recognize that for our students, “a change of discourse practices is a change of identity” and that we “socialize students into a world view that, given its power here and abroad, must be viewed critically, comparatively, and with a constant sense of the possibilities for change.”

Content-Based Approaches to Teaching Academic Writing
MAY SHIH San Francisco State University
In content-based academic writing instruction, writing is connected to study of specific academic subject matter and is viewed as a means of promoting understanding of this content. A rationale is presented for adopting content-based instruction to meet ESL composition goals; it is argued that such instruction develops thinking, researching, and writing skills needed for academic writing tasks and does so more realistically than does traditional instruction that isolates rhetorical patterns and stresses writing from personal experience. Five approaches for structuring content-based writing instruction are defined and exemplified: topic-centered “modules” or “minicourses,” content-based academic writing courses (reading and writing intensive), contentcentered English-for-special-purposes courses, composition or multiskill courses/tutorials as adjuncts to designated university courses, and individualized help with course-related writing at times of need (through faculty in writing-across-the-curriculum programs, tutors, and writing center staff).
How can intermediate- and advanced-level ESL composition instruction effectively prepare university-bound and matriculated students to handle writing assignments in academic courses? In recent years, composition programs for native and nonnative students have experimented with a range of content-based approaches to teaching academic writing—in which writing is linked to concurrent study of specific subject matter in one or more academic disciplines. This may mean that students write about material they are currently studying in an academic course or that the language or composition course itself simulates the academic process (e.g., minilectures, readings, and discussion on a topic lead into writing assignments). Students write in a variety of forms (e.g., short-essay tests, summaries, critiques, research reports) to demonstrate understanding of the subject matter and to extend their
617

knowledge to new areas. Writing is integrated with reading, listening, and discussion about the core content and about collaborative and independent research growing from the core material.
This article presents a rationale for content-based approaches to teaching academic writing skills and describes five instructional
approaches for ESL programs.

TYPES OF WRITING ASSIGNED IN ACADEMIC COURSES
To prepare students for university courses, it is important to have information about the types of writing tasks actually required across academic disciplines and about instructors’ purposes in assigning these tasks. Several published reports on writing and academic skills surveys include data on types and relative frequency of writing tasks in various academic fields, at undergraduate and graduate levels.
Behrens (1978), analyzing survey returns from 128 faculty in 18 academic disciplines and 6 professional fields at American University, found that essays interpreting experiences and/or readings were the most frequent type of papers assigned in undergraduate humanities and social science courses but were infrequent in professional school courses and never assigned in undergraduate science courses. In the sciences, experimental reports were the most frequent, and in the professions, reports providing factual discussion and research papers were the most often assigned. Of the undergraduate courses surveyed, 85% had some kind of final exam, most with at least some essay questions.
Eblen (1983) received completed questionnaires from 266 faculty in five academic divisions at the University of Northern Iowa. The
most frequently required form of writing across fields was, by far, the essay test—showing that writing as a mode of testing was stressed at least as much as writing as a mode of promoting new learning. Most assigned writing was informative or transactional— including, in decreasing order of frequency across fields, analytical papers, abstracts of readings, documented papers, essays or themes, lab reports, case reports, technical reports, and book reports. Some expressive or personal writing was assigned (personal essays, journals), significantly more in education and humanities courses than in science, social science, and business courses.
To find out what students were asked to write in university classes, Rose (1983) collected and analyzed 445 essay and takehome examination questions and paper topics from 17 departments at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Most questions and topics required (a) exposition and academic

618

TESOL QUARTERLY

argument, (b) synthesis of information from lectures and readings (rather than ideas from personal experiences or observations of immediate objects or events) and thoughtful reflection on material, and (c) writing which fits the philosophical and methodological assumptions of specific academic disciplines (p. 111).
Several recent studies have examined writing and other tasks required of international students. According to Open Doors 198283 (Boyan & Julian, 1984, p. 33), the fields with the heaviest concentrations of international students in 1982-1983 were engineering (23.1% of all students reported), business and management (18.1%), physical and life sciences (8.0%), mathematics/computer science (7.6%), and social sciences (7.1%).
Kroll (1979) gave 35 international students (mostly in engineering, science, and business fields) and 20 American students—all enrolled in freshman English courses at the University of Southern California—a questionnaire on their past, current, and future writing needs. The two groups had similar past writing experiences and current academic writing needs; international students also predicted a need to do some writing in English in future jobs. Kroll interpreted these results as justification for the requirement that ESL students take English composition courses. She urges, however, that composition courses let students practice the types of writing they really need.
In Kroll’s survey, the personal essay, the most common assignment in traditional composition courses, was rated as less important than tasks such as business letters and reports. When
asked to state the most challenging academic writing assignment faced in the current semester, international students most often specified term papers in fields remote from their major fields. This is a reminder that lower division undergraduates, more than students doing specialized graduate/professional work, need to be equipped to handle more diverse writing demands across disciplines.
Ostler (1980) reports on another survey of international students at the University of Southern California. To determine if its advanced ESL classes were meeting student needs, the American Language Institute administered a questionnaire to 131 of its students (96 undergraduates and 35 graduates), asking them to assess the academic skills needed to complete their degree objectives as well as to evaluate their own language abilities in several contexts. A distinction was found between skills most needed by undergraduates and those most needed by graduates. For example, undergraduates more frequently indicated a need to take multiple-choice exams than essay exams and to write lab
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 619

reports. Advanced undergraduates and graduates more frequently indicated a need to read academic journals and write critiques, research proposals, and research papers. The importance given to specific skills also varied by major field.
A.M. Johns (1981) distributed a questionnaire to 200 randomly
selected classroom instructors (10% of the faculty) at San Diego State University to determine which skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) were most critical for nonnative-speaker success in university classes. The 140 faculty who responded placed the receptive skills, reading and listening, ahead of writing (third) and speaking (fourth). Johns recommends that more extensive, systematic instruction in the receptive skills, using real academic materials and problems, be part of the academic ESL curriculum.
Teaching of the productive skills of writing and speaking, rather than being central to the curriculum, should be secondary to listening and reading activities. Writing, for example, could involve the paraphrase or summary of reading materials or the organization and rewriting of lecture notes. Speaking instruction should include response to readings or lectures rather than the preparation of dialogues or presentations. (p. 56)
Use of writing tasks which follow from, and are integrated with, the listening and reading of academic material is in fact a defining
characteristic of the academic content-based approaches to writing instruction discussed later in this article.
To find out what kinds of writing are required in graduate engineering courses, West and Byrd (1982) analyzed responses from 25 engineering faculty at the University of Florida, who rank ordered specified types of writing according to frequency of assignment to graduate students in classes during the preceding academic year. They found that faculty assigned examination, quantitative problem, and report writing most often, homework and paper writing less often, and progress report and proposal writing least often. If undergraduate technical writing courses are to prepare students not only for careers in industry but also for graduate studies, instructors should carefully consider the types of writing assigned; for example, progress reports and proposals might be de-emphasized.
Based on completed questionnaires from faculty in 34 U.S. and Canadian universities with high international student enrollments, Bridgeman and Carlson (1983, 1984) analyzed academic writing tasks and skills required of beginning graduate students in six academic disciplines with relatively high numbers of nonnative students: business management (MBA), civil engineering, electrical

620

TESOL QUARTERLY

engineering, psychology, chemistry, and computer science. Undergraduate English departments were also surveyed to provide data on writing requirements for beginning undergraduates across disciplines. Faculty were asked to indicate how frequently per semester first-year students were assigned various writing tasks and then to rate (on a scale of 1 to 5) the importance of given writing skills (e.g., describing an object or apparatus, arguing persuasively for a position) for success in the first year of graduate study. Some major findings were summarized as follows:
Even disciplines with relatively light writing requirements (e.g., electrical engineering) reported that some writing is required of firstyear students. Lab reports and brief article summaries are common writing assignments in engineering and the sciences. Longer research papers are commonly assigned to undergraduates and to graduate students in MBA, civil engineering and psychology programs.
Descriptive skills (e.g., describe apparatus, describe a procedure) are considered important in engineering, computer science, and psychology. In contrast, skill in arguing for a particular position is seen as very important for undergraduates, MBA students, and psychology majors, but of very limited importance in engineering, computer science, and chemistry. (1983, p. 55)
The studies cited above indicate that many types of writing tasks are assigned in university courses; types of tasks emphasized vary from one academic level to another (especially lower division undergraduate versus graduate), from one academic field to another, and even within disciplines. Writing is often required as a mode of demonstrating knowledge (e. g., in essay exams, summaries) and is also used by instructors as a mode of prompting independent thinking, researching, and learning (e. g., in critiques, research papers). Especially in the academic fields chosen most often by nonnative students, tasks require mostly transactional or informative writing; writing from personal experience only is rare.
Writing instruction for students at the beginning of their undergraduate education needs to prepare them to handle a variety of tasks across disciplines. As students begin to specialize, they must learn to gather and interpret data according to methods and standards accepted in their fields, to bring an increasing body of knowledge to bear on their interpretations, and to write in specialized formats.
Further empirical case studies such as, those of Faigley and Hansen (19S5) and Herrington (1985) are greatly needed to provide teachers and curriculum developers with information on writing demands posed in specific academic contexts and problems
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 621

experienced by student writers, as well as to establish a basis for comparisons of such demands and student needs across university courses.

APPROACHES TO TEACHING WRITING IN ESL PROGRAMS
Intermediate- and advanced-level ESL academic writing courses generally have one of four orientations, depending on which element of composing is taken as the basis for course organization: rhetorical patterns (form), function, process, or content.
Patient-centered approaches ask students to analyze and practice a variety of rhetorical or organizational patterns commonly found in academic discourse: process analysis, partition and classification, comparison/contrast, cause-and-effect analysis, pro-and-con argument, and so on. Kaplan (1966, 1967) and others point out that rhetorical patterns vary among cultures and suggest that nonnative students need to learn certain principles for developing and organizing ideas in American academic discourse, such as supporting generalizations by presenting evidence in inductive and deductive patterns of arrangement.
Model essays are generally used to help build this awareness. (Eschholz, 1980, and Watson, 1982, recommend using models after students have started writing—as examples of how writers solve organizational problems—rather than as ideals to be imitated. ) Writing assignments require students to employ the specific patterns under study. Traditionally, the source of the content for these essays has been students’ prior personal experience (how to make something, to practice process analysis; one city versus another city, to practice comparison/contrast). The assumption has been that once student writers assimilate the rhetorical framework, they will be able to use the same patterns appropriately in future writing for university courses.
Functional approaches recognize that in real writing, purpose, content, and audience determine rhetorical patterns. Starting from given patterns and asking students to find topics and produce essays to fit them is thus a reversal of the normal writing process. Instead of having students write a comparison/contrast essay, a functional approach would ask students to start with a specified purpose and audience, for example, “Persuade one of your friends who is planning to move that City X is a better place to live than City Y.” A rhetorical problem motivates writing. Students should not be asked “to fit their ideas into preexisting organizational molds (implying that there is a limited number of correct ways to

622

TESOL QUARTERLY

organize)”; rather, they should see that “organization grows out of meaning and ideas” (Taylor, 1981, p. 8).
Typically, in a functionally oriented writing program, writers assume a variety of roles; academic writing is only one context and usually not the sole focus. Contexts for writing tasks are carefully defined; purpose and audience are always specified. If the writer is placed in unfamiliar roles in which background knowledge about the topic may be lacking, data may be supplied in the form of facts, notes, tables or figures, quotations, documents, and so on. Specificpurpose tasks posed in McKay (1983) and McKay and Rosenthal (1980) and case problems such as those in Hays (1976), Field and Weiss (1979), and Woodson (1982) are good examples of functionally based composition assignments.
Process-centered approaches help student writers to understand their own composing process and to build their repertoires of strategies for prewriting (gathering, exploring, and organizing raw material), drafting (structuring ideas into a piece of linear discourse), and rewriting (revising, editing, and proofreading). Tasks may be defined around rhetorical patterns or rhetorical problems (purpose), but the central focus of instruction is the process leading to the final written product. Students are given sufficient time to write and rewrite, to discover what they want to say, and to consider intervening feedback from instructor and peers as they attempt to bring expression closer and closer to intention in successive drafts (Flower, 1985; Murray, 1980, 1985; Taylor, 1981; Zamel, 1982, 1983). Hartfiel, Hughey, Wormuth, and Jacobs (1985) and Flower (1985) are good examples of process-centered composition textbooks for ESL and for native English writers respectively.
A process approach which is student centered takes student writing (rather than textbook models) as the central course material and requires no strict, predetermined syllabus; rather, problems are treated as they emerge. “By studying what it is our students do in their writing, we can learn from them what they still need to be taught” (Zamel, 1983, p. 182). Revision becomes central, and the instructor intervenes throughout the composing process, rather than reacting only to the final product. Individual conferences and/or class workshops dealing with problems arising from writing in progress are regular features of process-centered instruction.
At least in early stages, the focus is on personal writing—students explore their personal “data banks” (Hartfiel et al., 1985, pp. 18-33; Hughey, Wormuth, Hartfiel, & Jacobs, 1983, p. 11).
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 623

Most students begin to write in personal papers about subjects that are important to them. Once they have successfully gone through the writing process, taking a subject that is not clear to them and developing and clarifying it so that it is clear to others, they are able to write about increasingly objective subjects, and they can see how to apply the process to a variety of writing tasks, academic and professional as well as personal. (Murray, 1985, p. 240)
Later in the course, students may move to academically oriented topics. They may continue to write primarily from personal experience and beliefs, or they may move to writing from sources, practicing new prewriting, drafting, and rewriting strategies as they tackle academic tasks like the library research paper.
Content-based approaches differ from traditional approaches to teaching academic writing in at least four major ways:
1. Writing from personal experience and observation of immediate surroundings is de-emphasized; instead, the emphasis is on writing from sources (readings, lectures, discussions, etc. ), on synthesis and interpretation of information currently being studied in depth. Writing is linked to ongoing study of specific subject matter in one or more academic disciplines and is viewed as a means to stimulate students to think and learn (Beach & Bridwell, 1984; Emig, 1977; Fulwiler, 1982; Newell, 1984).
2. The focus is on what is said more than on how it is said (Krashen, 1982, p. 168) in preparing students for writing and in responding to writing. The instructor who guides and responds to writing must know the subject matter well enough to explain it, field questions, and respond to content and reasoning in papers. Treatment of matters of form (organization, grammar, mechanics) and style do not dictate the composition course syllabus, but rather follow from writers’ needs.
3. Skills are integrated as in university course work: Students listen, discuss, and read about a topic before writing about it—as contrasted to the traditional belief that in a writing course, students should only write.
4. Extended study of a topic (some class treatment of core material and some independent and/or collaborative study/research) precedes writing, so that there is “active control of ideas” and “extensive processing of new information” (Anthony, 1985, p. 4) before students begin to write. A longer incubation period is permitted, with more input from external sources, than in traditional composition classes, in which students rely solely or primarily on self-generated ideas and write on a new topic for

624

TESOL QUARTERLY

each composition. Writing assignments can build on one another with “situational sequencing” (Schuster, 1984).
Intuition and experience suggest that when students write to a topic about which they have a great deal of well-integrated knowledge, their writing is more likely to be well organized and fluent; conversely, when students know little about a topic, their writing is more likely to fail. When students have few ideas about a topic, or when they are unwilling to risk stating the ideas they do have, their writing may rely on glib generalizations, unsupported by argument or enriching illustrations. (Langer, 1984, pp. 28-29)
RATIONALE FOR CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING: SKILLS DEVELOPED
The formal writing tasks assigned in university courses (as identified in the survey studies noted earlier) require students to exercise complex thinking, researching, and language skills. Traditional composition courses have often fallen short in helping ESL students to develop the skills needed to handle real academic writing tasks. Content-based academic writing instruction may be a more effective means of prompting students to develop the requisite skills because it deals with writing in a manner similar (or identical) to how writing is assigned, prepared for, and reacted to in real academic courses.
Prewriting
The formal academic writing tasks identified in the survey literature require students to restate or recast information presented in course lectures, readings, and discussions or to report on original thinking and research (primary or secondary) connected to the course content. Important prewriting skills needed to handle such tasks include the following:
1. Recalling, sorting, synthesizing, organizing, interpreting, and applying information presented in course lectures, readings, and class discussions (for essay exams, controlled out-of-class essays). The material must be mentally reordered as necessitated by the question, so that the essay will not be merely a “memory dump” (Flower, 1985, p. 66)–that is, a writer-based, rote recital of information in the order stored—but a coherent essay directly answering the question posed (Jacobs, 1984).
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 625

2. Calling upon personal experience and knowledge; selecting, interpreting, and connecting relevant ideas; reflecting; imagining (for personal essays, creative writing).
3. Relating concepts presented in course reading (and lectures, discussions) to personal experience (for response essays in the social sciences, journals).
4. Conducting primary (firsthand) research (for data-based reports).
a. Defining the research question and working hypotheses.
b. Collecting appropriate and sufficient data, with appropriate methods and instruments. Designing data-collection procedures and objectively recording data through systematic observations (for observational studies, field trip reports, case studies, etc. ); experiments (for lab reports, other experimental reports); surveys and questionnaires (for research reports in social science, business, and other fields); tests (for research reports in social science, education, and other fields); and letters of inquiry.
c. Analyzing and interpreting data correctly—using appropriate statistical tests and appropriate lines of reasoning; drawing, from events, appropriate inferences at various levels of abstraction (Applebee, Auten, & Lehr, 1981; Britton, Burgess, Martin, McLeod, & Rosen, 1975; Moffett, 1968): record of ongoing events, record of observed events, analysis and interpretation, theory and speculation.
5. Reading a text (poem, story, novel, play, historical document, etc. ) carefully and critically (for critical analyses, reviews/ critiques); identifying an interpretive problem and the appropriate techniques of analysis; isolating and analyzing points important for the chosen interpretive problem, for example, theme, plot, characters, language, style (Bazerman, 1985, pp. 354-358; Maimon, Belcher, Hearn, Nodine, & O’Connor, 1981, pp. 155-163).
6. Obtaining and organizing information from secondary sources (for research proposals, library research papers).
a. Choosing a suitable and compelling research topic and restricting it; making hypotheses about the central question/ problem to be investigated.
b. Locating appropriate reference sources (library skills).
c. Evaluating sources (to judge relevance and usefulness); selecting sources that work well together.

626

d. Skimming, scanning, and close reading; taking notes—to record information, aid understanding, and prompt own thinking; distinguishing more important and less important information; differentiating own ideas from those of sources; using direct quotation, paraphrase, and summary; recording page references.
e. Synthesizing information from secondary sources with writer’s own thoughts and firsthand data.
7. Recasting data and ideas collected from primary and/or secondary investigation, using schemata common in academic writing: listing, definition, process analysis, classification, comparison/contrast, analysis, and so on (D’Angelo, 1975, 1980; Kiniry & Strenski, 1985; Rose, 1979a, 1983). D’Angelo assumes a loose connection between thought processes and the organizational patterns which express ideas. Rose (1979a, p. 64) suggests that these are not only categories of rhetoric (ways to present information) but also of epistemology (ways to gain, explore, and order information); they are “thinking strategies as well as discourse strategies” (1983, p. 123).
Writing assignments in many traditional composition courses may fall short in preparing students for real academic writing because they require a different set of prewriting strategies than do writing tasks in university subject-matter courses. Pattern-centered approaches have traditionally given more attention to the form of the final written product than to the prewriting (and rewriting) process. Moreover, requiring student writers to find a topic to fit a pattern reverses the normal prewriting process (finding a pattern suitable to topic and purpose).
Functional approaches, by placing student writers in a variety of roles for which they may sometimes lack background knowledge, often shortcut the prewriting process by providing a great deal of guidance. For example, case assignments often provide students with the precise rhetorical problem and specific content for writing, rather than requiring them to go through the process of defining a problem and gathering information for themselves. Such writing is not self-initiated in the sense that most academic writing is (in which students must define their own rhetorical problems and gather relevant materials themselves).
Process-centered approaches often focus solely or primarily on personal writing and develop too narrow a repertoire of prewriting strategies; some strategies which are productive for personal and
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 627

creative writing may be counterproductive if inappropriately applied to academic writing tasks.
Some current invention strategies like brainstorming and freewriting encourage the student to generate material without constraint. . . . But . . . the more prescribed the task is, the less effective such freewheeling strategies might be: the student generates a mass of ideas that can lead to more disorder than order, more confusing divergence than clarifying focus. (Rose, 1984, p. 91)
In teaching writing apart from reading and in asking students to write primarily from personal experience, immediate observation, and preselected content, traditional composition courses may help student writers develop strategies for tapping their internal knowledge and attitudes (Skill 2 listed above), but often to the neglect of strategies for collecting, synthesizing, and interpreting new information from external sources (Skills 1, 3-7)—skills basic to the academic learning process.
It has been noted that few academic assignments ask students “to narrate or describe personal experiences, to observe immediate objects like the architecture of campus buildings, to express a general opinion on something not studied closely, to reflect on self” (Rose, 1983, p. 111), that “in most college courses, students are less often asked to do independent thinking than they are required to work with assigned sources—textbooks, lecture notes, and outside readings” (Spatt, 1983, p. v). There is evidence that academic discourse is different, more cognitively demanding, and requiring different skills from personal writing.
Formal, disciplined writing on academic and impersonal themes teaches skills different from those taught in narrative writing about personal experiences . . . the more difficult type of writing, which the school must teach, is that which requires more abstract thinking and more hierarchic structure, and that which is less immediate to the writer’s concrete, everyday experience. (Freedman & Calfee, 1984, pp. 472-473)
Student motivation may be higher when personal writing is deemphasized and a link to university content courses is made evident, as the relevance of composition instruction to academic studies can more easily be seen (Irmscher, 1979, p. 75; Rose, 1983, p. 113).
In content-based composition instruction, writing tasks require students to restate and recast information and ideas from readings, lectures, and discussions on a topic and possibly also to report on results of independent or group research on related topics. Thus, students develop strategies for collecting, synthesizing, and interpreting new information from external sources (Skills 1,4, 5,6)

628

TESOL QUARTERLY

as well as for connecting such new information to previous knowledge and beliefs (Skills 3, 5, 7). As in real academic writing, writing serves to help students consolidate and extend their understanding of the topics under study.
Writing the First Draft
In writing the first draft of a paper, writers take material previously gathered and organized and structure it into a linear piece of discourse; it is “the process of putting ideas into visible language” (Flower & Hayes, 1981, p. 373). While producing the draft, writers continue to discover what they want to say and alter and refine initial plans. Especially when producing formal, analytical discourse, it is rare that ideas and organization of the piece are fully formulated in a writer’s mind before drafting begins (Flower & Hayes, 1981; Murray, 1980, 1985; Taylor, 1981; Zamel, 1982). Since it is difficult to attend to considerations on many levels (essay, paragraph, sentence, word/phrase) all at once, writers typically write multiple drafts—that is, a first draft with revisions— for important papers. Writing the first draft of an academic paper requires at least the following skills:
1. Applying an efficient and productive writing process; being able to begin and continue writing; being able to alter initial plans as new ideas are discovered.
2. Monitoring one’s own process and progress while drafting, without being excessively diverted by premature editing, which is counterproductive (Rose, 1984, pp. 5, 72-73).
3. Having lexical/semantic knowledge and fluency-conveying intended meaning in words.
4. Having morphological and syntactic knowledge and fluency— communicating in words and sentences that are well formed, sentences that properly express coordinate and subordinate relationships among ideas.
5. Knowing discourse frames, conventions, and techniques; being able to adapt familiar discourse patterns or invent new patterns appropriate to the task.
a. Providing an appropriate overall design, using a standard format if necessary, for example, problem/purpose statement; review of research; methods, materials, and apparatus; results; discussion; conclusion.
b. Providing a clear statement of thesis or purpose at the beginning and adhering to this unifying idea/focus throughout
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 629

the paper: “decenteredness: the ability to maintain all parts of a piece of writing under the control of a unified purpose” (Mellon, 1978, p. 264).
c. Giving credit to secondary sources, in text and final reference list, in an appropriate format.
6. Knowing mechanical conventions: orthography, spelling, capitalization, punctuation, manuscript form.
In content-based approaches to developing academic writing skills, writing tasks require student writers to produce first drafts under the same or similar conditions as those faced in tackling assignments for subject-matter courses. Students must develop an efficient and productive writing process (Skills 1, 2) and apply knowledge of conventions of English discourse, lexicon/semantics, morphology, syntax, and mechanics (Skills 3, 4, 5, 6) to produce a draft in a format well suited to the specific assignment and under strict time constraints in the case of essay tests. Writers need to be able to adapt and combine familiar discourse patterns (e.g., comparison/contrast, cause/effect analysis).
Traditional pattern-centered approaches have often required students to produce essays in strict organizational molds—for example, a series of five-paragraph essays, each according to a given method of organization (process analysis, comparison/ contrast). Certainly, student writers need to become thoroughly familiar with the basic schemata, or “superframes,” for processing and communicating information in academic writing—for example, listing, definition, seriation, classification, summary, comparison/ contrast, analysis, and academic argument (Kiniry & Strenski, 1985, pp. 192-195). However, more important, they need to be able to apply such schemata to content studied in course-related readings and lectures and to analyze the wording of course writing assignments and determine appropriate organizational formats. Longer papers require an ability to combine different schemata in primary and secondary organizational plans.

Revising
Revising refers to reviewing and reworking a text. Two kinds of revision have been distinguished in research on composing processes. In “internal revision” (Murray, 1978, p. 91), or “revising to fit intentions” (Nold, 1982, p. 19), writers reread their drafts, discover what they said, match this message with what they intended to say, and rework (expand, delete, rearrange, alter) the content and structure of the written piece to make it congruent with

630

TESOL QUARTERLY

their intentions. In “external revision” (Murray, 1978, p. 91), or “revising to fit conventions” (Nold, 1982, p. 18), writers edit and proofread their text to detect and correct any violations of conventions of grammar, diction, style, and mechanics. In revising, a writer transforms writer-based prose (common in first drafts) into reader-based prose (Flower, 1979). Skills exercised during revising include the following:
1. Evaluating and revising content—testing what the paper says and the reader’s probable response against what the writer intends to say and how the writer intends the reader to react; adding, deleting, reordering, and altering material to make all parts of the discussion relevant, substantive, and informed.
2. Evaluating and revising organization—making any changes needed to create a reader-based (rather than a writer-based) organization.
3. Editing grammar-applying awareness of one’s own grammatical weaknesses and knowledge of English grammatical forms and rules to identify and correct grammatical errors.
4. Editing vocabulary and style—using knowledge of lexical and stylistic conventions and reference works (dictionary, thesaurus, handbook) to identify and correct problems and improve style.
5. Editing mechanics—applying knowledge of mechanical rules of English and using reference works to identify and correct errors in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, word division, abbreviations, manuscript form.
6. Checking documentation of sources.
When university faculty read student papers, they respond primarily to content: Does the paper discuss a topic accurately, thoroughly, logically, and creatively, with responsible acknowledgment of sources? Student writers receive feedback on how well their writing demonstrates understanding of the subject matter and original thinking.
In content-based approaches to teaching academic writing, student writers receive this type of feedback to use in subsequent revision (helping to develop Skills 1, 2). In contrast, in traditional composition classes, instructor feedback has often been largely aimed at matters of form and style rather than of substance and organization (e. g., Sommers, 1982; Zamel, 1985). If students write about topics in their own academic specializations, composition instructors often lack background knowledge to respond meaningfully to the content, reasoning, and organization of the paper.
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 631

When writing complex academic essays, student writers need to be able to edit their own papers for grammatical, lexical, stylistic, mechanical, and documentation errors (Skills 3, 4, 5, 6). The ability to produce highly accurate prose in controlled compositions and personal writing does not necessarily transfer across discourse types.
We have evidence to suggest that while a writer might eventually produce grammatically correct prose for one kind of assignment, that correctness might not hold when she faces other kinds of tasks. Brooke Nielson, for example, found that when her sample of traditional writers shifted registers from the informal (writing to peers) to the formal (writing to an academic audience), their proficiency fell apart. . . . So we might guide a student to the point where she writes with few errors about her dorm, but when she is asked, say, to compare and contrast two opinions on dormitory housing, not to mention two economic theories, the organizational demands of comparing and contrasting and the more syntactically complicated sentences often attending more complex exposition or argument put such a strain on her cognitive resources and linguistic repertoire that error might well reemerge. . . . we cannot assume a simple transfer of skills across broadly different discourse demands. (Rose, 1983, pp. 113-114)

FIVE INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES
Content-based academic writing instruction can be structured in a number of ways. For ESL students who are beyond an elementary proficiency level in English, at least five approaches can be distinguished:
1. Topic-centered “modules” or “minicourses” (attention to all four language skills)—in practice, most commonly used with students in the upper levels of preacademic (intensive) ESL programs
2. Content-based academic writing courses, that is, composition courses organized around sets of readings on selected topics (reading and writing skills emphasized)—appropriate for newly matriculated undergraduate ESL students, to prepare them to handle writing tasks across disciplines
3. Content-centered English-for-special-purposes (ESP) courses, that is, field-specific, “sheltered” subject-matter courses (multiskill)—workable with students at any level beyond elementary proficiency, since complexity of material is adjusted to suit student level; at any stage of university study, since course is designed around students’ backgrounds, needs, and interests; whenever students share an interest in a particular subject

632

TESOL QUARTERLY

4. Composition or multiskill English-for-academic-purposes (EAP) courses/tutorials as adjuncts to designated university content courses—feasible for students in the upper level(s) of an intensive ESL program and for matriculated ESL students
5. Individualized help with course-related writing at times of need (through faculty in writing-across-the-curriculum programs, tutors, and writing center staff )—for matriculated ESL students
Krashen (1985, pp. 69-74) has proposed a four-stage plan as a general schema for acquisition-based second language teaching programs. In Stage 1, General Language Teaching, second language input comprehensible to beginners is provided in a low-anxiety situation and in an organized way. In Stage 2, Sheltered Language Teaching, sheltered subject-matter courses (in which native speakers of the language of instruction are excluded, helping to ensure that instructor input is adjusted to student level) serve to ease students into learning academic subject matter in the second language. In Stage 3, Partial Mainstream, students further develop second language competence through exposure to unmodified input on selected topics (“narrow input”) which they have the best chance of understanding and strong motivation to study. ESL students who only take courses in their majors may never leave the early part of this stage (p. 76). In Stage 4, Full Mainstream, second language competence is expanded to a greater number of subject areas.
If Krashen’s four-stage plan is used as a framework, Approaches 1 and 3 (cited above) for teaching academic writing fit into Stage 2 (sheltered classes, modified input), Approach 2 (and possibly Approach 3) fits into Stage 3 (partial mainstream, narrow but unmodified input), and Approaches 4 and 5 fit into Stages 3 and 4 (partial/full mainstream).
The five approaches are described below; examples are given from programs for native and nonnative students.
Topic-Centered Modules or Minicourses
In one content-based approach to teaching writing (as well as other language skills), instructional units, or modules (Baker, Baldwin, Fein, Gaskill, & Walsleben, 1984), or minithematic units (Dubin, 1985) simulate actual university courses through intensive reading, live or videotaped lectures, films, discussions, writing tasks, quizzes, tests, and other activities. The units may be independent modules or minicourses—as in the UCLA Extension American Language Center’s 3-week modules on topics such as
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 633

“The Brain,” “Marketing and Advertising,” “Rich and Poor Nations,” and “The Roles of Men and Women” (Baker et al., 1984), or the University of Wisconsin-Madison Summer Language Institute’s 3-week minicourses on topics such as “The United Nations,” “NASA Space Programs, “ “American Music,” or “Current Events.”
Alternatively, thematically related units may be tied together in an extended, content-based course (same length as a real academic course). Examples of such extended courses are the American culture courses offered by many intensive ESL programs (readings, lectures, films, discussions, oral skills activities, and writing about a series of cultural topics) and the ecology course offered in Critical Thinking, Critical Choices (Aebersold, Kowitz, Schwarte, & Smith, 1985), which draws information from natural sciences, politics,
economics, anthropology, and engineering. Thematic units may be part of an orientation to American
universities or part of an academic skills course (Eskey, Kraft, & Alvin, 1984; Eskey, Kraft, Shaw, & Alvin, 1981), as in the University of Southern California American Language Institute’s EAP courses (Dubin, 1985, pp. 11-15). In the Institute’s EAP-Regular course (“Acculturation to Academic Life”), students first work through a diagnostic miniunit using the theme of “Levels of Language,” then a thematic unit on “American Education” to orient themselves to university organization, requirements, services, and academic skills, and finally other thematic units on topics such as “Nature vs. Nurture, “ “Issues in American Media,” “Crime and Punishment,” and “Corporate Responsibility. ” In the EAP Science and Technology course, the last segment of the course consists of three 3-week science units based on material from the fields of astronomy, geology, and biology.
In these minicourses, the focus is on comprehending and learning new content. The classroom is a place where second language acquisition takes place, as well as learning. Writing practice is integrated with practice of other language skills (reading, listening, speaking) as in actual academic situations, and in similar proportion, so writing may not be stressed (writing and speaking being secondary to reading and listening, as noted by A.M. Johns, 1981).
Reading and discussion of core material could be followed by individualized reading, research, and writing tasks. For example, Cortese (1985) describes an experimental course (University of Turin) on the topic of American Indians; in the latter part of the course, students selected a book on the topic to read independently,

634

TESOL QUARTERLY

made an oral report to class, wrote the report, and participated in a debate.
Possible difficulties in implementing the minicourse or thematicmodules approach include instructor hesitation about teaching in certain content areas and the need for staff time and expertise to select, adapt, and/or develop readings, minilectures, and study materials appropriate to student level. Topics with the greatest potential to hold student interest may not also be areas in which ESL instructors are knowledgeable. Thus, this approach requires that instructors be open to acquiring new knowledge along with their students and willing to exert effort on curriculum development. As the approach has, in practice, been aimed at upper level, preacademic ESL students interested in diverse academic disciplines, the materials selected should not assume any specialized background knowledge on a topic; thus, language instructors should easily be able to understand the materials and lead discussions on them.
Content-Based Academic Writing Courses (Reading and Writing Intensive)
Content-based academic writing courses prepare students who are at the beginning of undergraduate study to handle writing tasks across disciplines. Typically, a course may be organized around sets of readings on selected topics—narrow input, in Krashen’s sense (1985, p. 73). In recent years, a number of texts of this nature have been published—generally aimed at academic writing courses for native English writers.
For example, Writing and Reading Across the Curriculum (Behrens & Rosen, 1985) uses sets of readings on topics such as artificial intelligence, obedience to authority, fairy tales, death and dying, nuclear war, morality and the movies, and the business of college sports. Making Connections Across the Curriculum (Chittenden & Kiniry, 1986) clusters readings around such topics as power, the origins of the nuclear arms race, the urban experience, the working world, the nature of learning, the treatment of cancer, and the impact of animals. The Course of Ideas (Gunner& Frankel, 1986) offers readings in Western civilization from Greek antiquity to the 20th century. Integrated sets of readings are also offered in Zimbardo and Stevens (1985), Bean and Ramage (1986), and Anselmo, Bernstein, and Schoen (1986).
Students are guided to practice reading skills, study skills, and forms of writing common to many academic writing assignments, such as summary, personal response, synthesis, and critique/
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 635

evaluation (Behrens & Rosen, 1985; Spatt, 1983), and basic expository schemata such as listing, definition, seriation, classification, and comparison/contrast (Kiniry & Strenski, 1985, pp. 192195). This type of content-based course also serves to introduce
students to the nature of inquiry, techniques and standards for gathering and evaluating evidence, and writing formats characteristic of different academic fields (Bazerman, 1985; Bizzell, 1982; Faigley & Hansen, 1985; Maimon et al., 1981).
Later in the course, individual writing tasks may be given, using material from students’ academic courses, ideally with the help of cooperating teachers. Clark (1984), who describes formalized procedures for enlisting such help, asks students to write a 10-page paper investigating both sides of a controversial issue in a chosen discipline. Examples of such issues are, “Is the formation of memory a chemical or electrical process?” (psychology) and “Should the British have used large aircraft formations against the Germans in World War II?” (history) (p. 186). Cooperating professors in students’ concurrent academic courses are asked to assist by (a) helping the student to focus on a controversial issue that can be handled in 10 pages and (b) critiquing a draft of the student’s paper, “commenting on accuracy in reporting the data and clarity of the summary and resolution of the arguments” (p. 189). This arrangement helps solve the problem of a composition instructor lacking the knowledge about a student’s topic to comment substantively. In addition, “students have the opportunity . . . to engage in the process of collaborative learning characteristic of the work of professional scholars and writers” (p. 188).
A content-based academic writing course is attractive because it can be incorporated into an existing composition program without necessitating the cooperation of instructors in other academic disciplines (although limited cooperation may be desirable, e.g., to facilitate the individualized research papers just described).
For ESL composition programs, this approach requires instructors to be resourceful in assembling sets of readings which will be comprehensible, suitable, and interesting for members of a particular class. Published ESL texts with sets of closely related readings are scarce; as noted earlier, most currently available anthologies are aimed at native English writers. ESL instructors can selectively use native-speaker texts but should recognize that the topics in such texts may not appeal to a certain class or that selections can be discouragingly difficult for a particular group.
Instructors should be prepared to conduct an initial needs assessment to guide materials selection, and they should be knowledgeable about places to turn for course readings. Possible

636

TESOL QUARTERLY

sources for readings on a topic include textbook anthologies in specific fields, periodicals, and reference tools. Examples of the latter are The Reference Shelf series (H. W. Wilson Company), which reprints from the year’s periodicals articles and speeches on current topics (e.g., arms control, the world food crisis, crime and society, ethnic America, the issue of gun control), and the Opposing Viewpoints series (Greenhaven Press), which reprints articles on issues with opposing viewpoints (e. g., male/female roles, the arms race, American values).
Instructors must also be willing to spend time constructing reading, discussion, and study questions (serving as prewriting materials, to prompt students to think through a topic), essay tests, and good academic writing assignments:
Good assignments can help students remember information and master general concepts through writing about them; they can help students master through writing the skills and the ways of thinking of a particular discipline; they can engage students, through writing, in the process of discovering connections between themselves and their subject, of understanding the world they live in; and they can evoke, instead of bloodless responses or mere regurgitation of information, independent, even creative, thought. (Brostoff, 1979, p. 184)
For assistance, instructors can turn to the writing-across-thecurriculum literature, much of which seeks to clarify how writing tasks can be formulated and sequenced so as to engage students and stimulate thinking on a topic, how students can be prepared for writing, and how to respond to the content of student writing. (See, for example, Bean, 1981-1982; Bean, Drenk, & Lee, 1982; Beyer, 1979; Brostoff, 1979; Fulwiler & Jones, 1982; Giroux, 1979; and articles in Fulwiler & Young, 1982; Gere, 1985; and Griffin, 1982.)
Content-Centered ESP Courses
Content-based composition instruction may also be tied to the content of a specific academic discipline. Any or all language skills may be emphasized in ESP courses. In “sheltered” subject-matter courses, native speakers of the language of instruction are excluded. This helps to ensure that instructors will speak to students in comprehensible language and that texts and other materials will be explained as needed (Krashen, 1985, p. 17). Thus, sheltered ESP courses can be offered to students at any level beyond elementary, whenever a group of students at a given level share an interest in a particular subject and instructors have, or are willing to acquire, content knowledge.
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 637

Examples of such courses are the sheltered psychology classes offered to English and French immersion students at the University of Ottawa (Edwards, Wesche, Krashen, Clément, & Kruidenier, 1984; Krashen, 1985; Wesche, 1985), a course in English for business and economics offered at Oregon State University’s English Language Institute (McDougal & Dowling, 1980), and ESP courses
offered at Western Illinois University’s WESL Institute—courses in English for business/economics (Proulx, 1984), English for agriculture and biology (Smith, 1984), and English for computer science (McKee, 1984).
Team teaching by a subject teacher and a language teacher may be desirable when a single teacher does not possess both the subject knowledge and the language teaching expertise. For example, the English for Overseas Students Unit at the University of Birmingham has implemented team teaching to meet student needs in lecture comprehension and the writing of examination questions in such fields as transportation and plant biology (Dudley-Evans, 1984; T.F.
Johns & Dudley-Evans, 1980). The subject teacher and language teacher divide the work of recording lectures and preparing comprehension checks (including exam questions), and during class time, both help students with problems that arise.
A similar team-teaching arrangement is reported at the English Language Unit at Ngee Ann Polytechnic in Singapore (DudleyEvans, 1984). An English-for-occupational-purposes writing course was designed to prepare students for writing tasks they might have to carry out in future jobs in building maintenance and management (e.g., writing of specifications, memos, accident reports, progress
reports, and meeting reports). The subject teacher finds authentic or realistic situations that are the basis for report assignments. As students work on these assignments, both teachers act as consultants. Models written by the subject teacher or based on the best student work are later presented and discussed.
As in the minicourse or thematic-modules approach, a major potential difficulty in implementing content-centered ESP courses is the subject-matter knowledge required of the language instructor. In practice, this problem has been handled in various ways: (a) asking subject-area instructors to teach the course (as in Edwards et al., 1984; Wesche, 1985) —and perhaps provide guidance on strategies to use with the nonnative students; (b) employing language instructors who happen also to have the necessary expertise in the chosen subject (e. g., assigning an ESL instructor who is knowledgeable about microcomputers to teach a course on microcomputer programming/applications); (c) using team teaching (as in Dudley-Evans, 1984; T.F. Johns & Dudley-Evans,

638

TESOL QUARTERLY

1980); or (d) choosing materials aimed at a general audience (i.e., that assume minimal previous specialized knowledge). In the latter case, the instructor learns alongside the students (as in Proulx, 1984; Smith, 1984) and uses additional supports such as guest speakers, films, and field trips.
Composition or Multiskill EAP Courses/Tutorials as Adjuncts to Designated University Courses
A fourth approach for connecting composition instruction to the study of academic subject matter is to link composition or multiskill EAP courses (or tutorials) to selected university content courses. Students enroll in both courses; writing assignments center on the material of the content course. In this “interdependent method” (Press, 1979), responsibility for guiding student thinking and writing is shared between academic content instructors and composition/ EAP instructors.
The university content course is typically an introductory course, often a survey course. Composition-section adjuncts to such courses have become popular in programs for native students. For example, Wilkinson (1985) describes a freshman composition course at Cornell University which is taught in parallel with an elementary biology course. Griffin (1985, pp. 401-402) gives additional examples.
The content course could be an interdisciplinary course. For example, composition courses have been linked to the Freshman Interdisciplinary Studies Program at Temple University (Scheffler, 1980). Freshmen (all levels—remedial to honors) join four to six faculty members in a year-long interdisciplinary study of a broad topic such as “The Environment,” “The Human Condition,” “Law and Disorder,” and “Creativity.”
The content course could also be an upper division or graduate course. Examples are a composition adjunct course to a University of Michigan History Department colloquium on the Indochina conflict (Reiff, 1980) and a joint composition and metallurgical engineering class given at Ohio State University (Andrews, 1976). In such upper division writing adjunct courses, students can be taught to write according to conventions within a particular discipline.
Tutorial adjuncts are another possible arrangement; then students would not be limited to selecting among only a few designated university courses. For example, individualized writing adjunct courses have been offered at all levels (freshman through graduate) at California State University campuses (Sutton, 1978).
CONTENT-BASED APPROACHES TO TEACHING ACADEMIC WRITING 639
I

While the adjunct model has spread to many university
composition programs for native students, it has been slower in
getting established in ESL programs. ESL adjunct courses tend to
be multiskill EAP courses, rather than focusing on composition, as in the courses described for native students. At UCLA and the
University of Southern California, ESL courses have been linked with introductory courses in the liberal arts and sciences (Snow & Brinton, 1985). At Macalester College, ESL students may elect a “bridge course” in which an ESL academic study skills course immediately follows a subject course such as geography (Peterson, 1985; Peterson & Guyer, 1986). “Pre” and “post” ESL classes “sandwiched” around content courses have been used at the English Language Institute at Oregon State University (Longenecker, 1982; Polensek, 1980).
The potential contributions and possible limitations of the adjunct-course approach for ESL programs in general, and for preparing ESL students to handle university writing tasks in particular, remain to be evaluated. What is needed, minimally, is cooperation from subject-area instructors and ESL faculty willingness to step into subject-area classrooms and keep up with class events. For ESL instructors seeking to set up adjunct courses, the experiences of composition adjunct programs already in place for native students are a rich source of information.

Individualized Help With Course-Related Writing
at Times of Need
A final content-based approach for helping students develop academic writing skills is to provide assistance with course-related writing at times of need. Such assistance might be given by subjectarea faculty, tutors, and/or writing center staff.
Many writing-across-the-curriculum programs now in existence place some responsibility for writing instruction with instructors in all academic disciplines. A basic premise is that “writing skills must be practiced and reinforced throughout the curriculum, otherwise they will atrophy, no matter how well they were taught in the beginning” (Griffin, 1985, p. 402). In addition, faculty have discovered that writing helps students to analyze and synthesize course material—that writing is learning and that faculty need to be actively involved in stimulating students’ thinking and writing.
Through channels such as collaboration with writing center staff and faculty workshops and seminars on writing, subject-area instructors learn more about writing—what it is; how it can be done; how it can promote learning; and how it can be effectively assigned,

640

TESOL QUARTERLY

guided, and evaluated. Published discussions of such programs and faculty development seminars include Connelly and Irving (1976), Maimon (1979), Rose (1979b), Raimes (1980), Fulwiler (1981), Herrington (1981), Thaiss (1982), Abraham (1983), and Young and Fulwiler (1986). Guidance for instructors in all disciplines is provided by Anderson, Eisenberg, Holland, Wiener, and RiveraKron (1983), Moss and Holder (1982), Walvoord (1982), and Griffin (1982).
ESL staff should establish ongoing communication with content instructors when the latter guide student writing in courses enrolling ESL students. Different forms of contact can be explored, for example, contact through writing center tutors, ESL programsponsored faculty development seminars, or participation in established faculty seminars.
Finally, ESL students might receive guidance for course-related writing through ESL tutors and campus writing centers. TESL/ TEFL programs can help to train tutors who have not worked extensively with ESL students.
A potential problem with relying on tutors and writing center staff may be lack of sufficient trained personnel. Effective procedures must be established for student referral, writing diagnosis, tutor recruitment and matching, and staff development. Another limitation can be a tutor’s lack of knowledge about the topics on which students write; in such cases, feedback can be given on a paper’s form, but not on substance. Ideally, students who are writing papers in specific fields would be matched with peer tutors majoring in these fields.
CONCLUSION
Instructors who choose to use a content-based approach to teach academic writing skills recognize that in the academic community, writing is a tool for assessing and promoting student understanding and independent thinking on specific subject matter; they seek to give developing student writers the same experience of “writing to learn.”
For all academically oriented ESL students who are beyond an elementary proficiency level in English, there are ways to structure academic content-based instruction. ESL instructors can draw ideas from a variety of established native and nonnative programs.
To determine the most suitable approach for a particular group of students, a number of factors must be considered: student status (where students are at in their studies–their knowledge base), academic interests shared by class members, English proficiency

level, need/desire for intensive work on all skills versus emphasis on reading and writing, types of cooperative arrangements with subject-area instructors which are feasible, and subject-matter knowledge and interests of language instructors.
At present, content-based ESL curricula are still relatively new at the university level. On a practical level, there is a need for faculty to develop, evaluate, refine, and share materials and pedagogical strategies for each of the five frameworks discussed in this article. On an empirical level, there is a need for research of all types— needs assessment studies to guide syllabus design and materials selection, curriculum evaluation studies, and controlled evaluation studies on the effects of receiving specific types of content-based instruction. Student and teacher reactions need to be documented systematically. Empirical data are needed to support the belief held by many that content-based instruction can help ESL students to become more confident and competent when they tackle academic writing.

Functional Competencies in the U.S. Refugee Program: Theoretical and Practical Problems
JAMES W. TOLLEFSON University of Washington
In the past decade, the functional, competency-based approach has come to dominate ESL curriculum development. Though the approach is widely praised, some ESL specialists have recently criticized competency-based “survival ESL.” This article examines theoretical and practical deficiencies in how curricular objectives are selected for the functional approach, the central role of values in functional curricula, and limitations in validating tests of functional competence. It is argued that these problems seriously undermine efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of ESL programs using functional curricula. These issues are illustrated through an analysis of the functional curricula of the U.S. Refugee Processing Centers, the largest survival ESL program ever created to prepare immigrants for resettlement in America.
In the past decade, functional, competency-based curricula have become the dominant approach to language curriculum development. The focus of wide praise (e.g., Chamot, 1983; Findley & Nathan, 1980; Munby, 1978; Widdowson, 1978; Wilkins, 1976), competency-based curricula have been called “the most important breakthrough in adult ESL” (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1983b, p. 1), and they are used in many language programs as well as in adult basic education (ABE ). In Europe, functional competencies are the basis for the Council of Europe syllabus (van Ek, 1977). The most important ABE program in the United States, the heavily promoted Adult Performance Level (APL) project (see Northrup, 1977) of the U.S. Office of Education and the University of Texas, employs a functional approach. In ESL, refugee programs in Southeast Asia and in the United States also have adopted functional curricula.
649

While there has been controversy about the theory of language underlying a functional approach for almost a decade (see Munby, 1978), only recently have some ESL specialists begun to raise
problems with the theoretical assumptions and the social
implications of functional ESL curricula (e.g., Richards, 1984). In an
important review of competency-based ESL, Auerbach (1986) outlines the major criticisms of the approach, noting in particular that it is “part of a tradition of socializing immigrants for specific roles in the existing socioeconomic order” (p. 411). Because the approach plays a central role in the education of today’s immigrants, Auerbach calls for “informed debate” and “critical thinking” about the theory and practice of functional, competency-
based ESL. Within that context, this article examines the functional curricula
developed for the U.S. Refugee Processing Centers (RPCS) in Southeast Asia. The major focus of this analysis is the historical precedents of the functional approach, theoretical and practical deficiencies in the procedure for establishing curricular objectives, the central role of values in functional curricula, and limitations in attempts to assess functional competence. The fact that such an important and heavily funded effort to implement a functional curriculum has had serious difficulties suggests that theoretical and practical problems will continue to confront supporters of the
functional, competency-based approach.

HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS OF FUNCTIONAL CURRICULA
Functional curricula differ considerably, since the meaning and use of the terms competency based and functional v a r y . Nevertheless, there is general agreement in ABE that the approach emphasizes observable behaviors (competencies) which are necessary for living in society (e.g., filling out forms, writing checks). In ESL, the approach emphasizes language competencies for achieving communicative aims, such as giving and receiving information, expressing likes and dislikes, and asking for and giving clarification. Furthermore, the approach requires actual use (performance) of language in “real” situations. The most widely used definition of functional, competency-based ESL is that of Grognet and Crandall (1982): “A competency-based curriculum is a performance-outline of language tasks that lead to a demonstrated mastery of the language associated with specific skills that are necessary for individuals to function proficiently in the society in which they live” (p. 3). In ABE and ESL programs for refugees, the competencies are those “considered essential for the survival of

Indochinese refugees newly arrived in the United States” (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1983a, p. 5).
Though it is often claimed (e.g., Chamot, 1983) that functional curricula have their foundation in the 1970s, particularly in the work of the Council of Europe (van Ek, 1977), functional curricula in
adult education can in fact be traced to the mid-19th century. Griffith and Cervero (1977) show that Spencer, in the 1860s, outlined the major areas of human activity which he believed should be the basis for curricular objectives. These areas, they point out, bear great similarity to the APL project (see Northrup, 1977).
Bobbitt (1926) developed curricular objectives according to his analysis of the functional competencies required for adult living in America. Bobbitt’s work also closely resembles the APL project, which is the culmination of the functional approach to curriculum development begun over 100 years earlier and which was used as one of the main resources for RPC curriculum development. Thus, there is a direct historical and conceptual link between educational innovation in the mid-19th century and present-day functional curricula.

THE U.S. REFUGEE PROGRAM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
Coordinated and funded by the Bureau for Refugee Programs of the Department of State, the U.S. Refugee Program in Southeast Asia is designed to prepare Indochinese refugees for resettlement in the United States. The program operates at three RPCS: Phanat Nikhom in Thailand, Galang in Indonesia, and Bataan in the Philippines. Since late 1980, approximately 150,000 refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Kampuchea have completed the intensive program in ESL, cultural orientation (CO), and preemployment training (PET) at the RPCS. The Philippine RPC is by far the largest, enrolling up to 8,000 refugees at a time.
The foundation for this unprecedented effort to prepare immigrants for resettlement in America is a series of curricula for separate ESL, CO, and PET components, as well as for the new (late 1985) Preparation for American Secondary Schools program for adolescents. Each RPC develops its own functional, competency-based curriculum for each component, based on a regional curriculum adopted for each component in meetings held once or twice a year. Because many locally hired teachers are inexperienced and without previous training in ESL or in education, the curricula are extremely detailed and are used by many teachers as actual lesson plans.

FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCIES IN THE U.S. REFUGEE PROGRAM

Selection of Curricular Objectives
The task for developers of a functional curriculum is to select curricular objectives “that are necessary for individuals to function proficiently in the society in which they live” (Grognet & Crandall, 1982, p. 3). This task of selection presents serious difficulties, primarily because there is no scientific procedure available to validate competency lists for most programs. For this reason, many ABE curriculum specialists have abandoned the approach in recent years (see Griffith & Cervero, 1977). The essential problem is that there is no known universe of competencies for “functioning proficiently,” for “adult living,” or for “survival,” nor is there a methodology for systematically selecting competencies for inclusion in a curriculum. (An additional difficulty is that terms such as adult living, survival, and functioning proficiently apparently are not meant to be understood literally. What is important is the operational definition of these terms. In the RPCS, survival is operationally defined for adults as “having a job.”)
The goal of the APL project, for example, is to develop learners’ competence in areas needed for “meeting the requirements of adult living” (Northrup, 1977, p. 2), yet there is no universally acknowledged set of these competencies and no known methodology for discovering them. Similarly, within the refugee program there is no validated list of the competencies “considered essential for the survival of Indochinese refugees” (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1983a, p. 5), nor can they be discovered by any known research technique. The competencies may indeed be “considered [italics added] essential,” but they have not been proven to be essential.
Despite this problem, curriculum developers must decide which specific competencies will be included. The procedure by which objectives are included in the RPC curricula illustrates a further problem with the functional approach. Regional curricula for each component of the RPC program are established and reviewed in region-wide meetings attended by program managers, supervisors, teachers, and curriculum developers, as well as by representatives of the U.S. State Department and the Center for Applied Linguistics, which operates a regional support office in Manila. The procedure for the ESL curriculum, which is typical, is described as follows:
Consensus was used as much as possible to determine which language items would be included. In many cases, consensus either could not be reached or was not truly possible, given that there is often more than one common and appropriate choice of language for any survival situation.

The product of these meetings was a Standardized ESL Curriculum Guide which was to be used as the basis for curriculum development in all sites. (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1983a, pp. 5-6)
Curriculum development in the three sites, then, follows a similar procedure: Staff decide which competencies are to be included. This procedure illustrates Ammons’s (1969) observation that “methodology for the determination of objectives relies upon the consensus of some group or groups. The differences among approaches lie in the identification of the groups and the questions asked of these groups” (p. 911). The validity of RPC competencies thus depends upon (a) the experience and judgment of the individuals who carry out the analysis and (b) their criteria for selecting competencies.
Because assessing individuals’ experience and judgment is complex and open to interpretation, this is not a strong basis for validation of a curriculum. In the RPCS, some crucial instructional managers and supervisors do not have graduate degrees in ESL, and most teachers, who are hired locally and have not visited the United States, cannot be expected to know what might be needed to adapt successfully to American life. As RPC personnel change, competency lists are changed as well, indicating that the central criterion for including competencies is individuals’ opinions or beliefs about the language, cultural adaptation, and preemployment skills refugees may require.
Yet supporters of functional curricula usually claim that criteria for selecting competencies are “objective,” grounded in an analysis of learners’ needs, and free from the values and biases of individual curriculum developers (see Kasworm, 1980). The procedure for selecting RPC competencies, however, illustrates that the functional approach fundamentally depends upon the opinions and beliefs of individuals and that the criterion for including competencies is the (changing) consensus of a (changing) group of individuals.
MacDonald and Clark (1973) note that
curriculum development is a continuous process of making human value judgments about what to include and exclude, what to aim for and avoid, and how to go about it—difficult judgments, even when aided by technical and scientific data and processes. (p. 408)
Because functional curricula are not based upon “scientific data and processes,” they are especially subject to the value judgments of curricular staff. However, the values underlying curriculum decisions are rarely stated explicitly; therefore, it is important to examine functional curricula in order to discover the values implicit in them.

Objectives and Values in Functional Curricula
Objectives are included in a functional curriculum when, in the opinion of curriculum developers, they will help to achieve program goals such as “functioning proficiently” or “surviving” in American society. Because such goals involve implicit conceptions both of social organization and of appropriate individual behavior in society, it is not surprising that competency-based programs implicitly express value judgments in these areas. The RPC
program, designed to prepare refugees for a place in American society, illustrates the central role of values in a functional curriculum.
The declared goal of the RPCS is to prepare refugees for selfsufficiency as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States. Within the RPCS, self-sufficiency is interpreted to mean employment. The Philippine CO curriculum, for example, states that “a broad objective of our classes is to prepare our students for the American job market so that they will more quickly become self-sufficient” (International Catholic Migration Commission, 1985, Day 27). According to the former Deputy Coordinator for Refugee Programs of the U.S. Embassy in Manila, the goal of PET classes is “keeping refugees on a track into employment rather than onto welfare rolls or other government assistance” (International Catholic Migration Commission, 1984). The introduction to the regional PET curriculum states that “this component is designed to enable refugees to better function in any entry-level job in the U. S.” (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1984, p. 5).
Because there is no validated set of functional competencies that will enable Indochinese refugees to find and retain jobs, several possible approaches to curriculum development may be imagined, including occupational skills training for specific jobs, long-term language education, or adult basic education.
Although it is usually claimed that the functional approach is performance centered or behavior centered (at the Philippine RPC, curricula are expected to include measurable behavioral objectives [Findley & Nathan, 1980]), ESL, CO, and PET objectives in the RPCS reflect the programmatic assumption that changing refugees’ values and attitudes is crucial to achieving program goals. Occasionally, this assumption is made explicit. For instance, the regional PET curriculum (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1984) states that “values of the American workplace should be taught. . , . Every effort should be made to help students internalize the values discussed and to practice the behavior which demonstrates that they are understood” (p. 8). The former Deputy Coordinator for

654

TESOL QUARTERLY

Refugee Programs argued that refugees “have to understand that there is a philosophy of employment embodied in the language, and I think that’s the basic reason that the preemployment curriculum came about” (International Catholic Migration Commission, 1984). Similarly, the former Deputy Project Director of the Philippines RPC, documenting the shift in CO classes away from information giving, argued that changes in attitudes and values are crucial for successful resettlement (Redding, 1985).
Such statements are exceptions, however, as the values contained in functional curricula are generally implicit rather than explicit. The following sample of curricular objectives from the RPCs illustrates important values implicit in RPC curricula. Due to frequent revisions, a component may use two or three curricula simultaneously, as in the Philippine ESL component during 19841985. The sample ESL and PET competencies listed here are selected primarily from the regional list. The CO competencies are from the Philippine curriculum revised in September, 1985; earlier regional lists do not reflect the shift away from information giving that took place in 1983-1985.
CO Component (International Catholic Migration Commission, 1985)
1. To provide language exercises that emphasize “careful listening (taking directions)” and “confirming orders (asking for clarification) when needed” (Day 29)
2. To develop the belief “that self-sufficiency is highly regarded in American society, that upward mobility is possible by hard work and perseverance . . . and that men and women have equal access to employment opportunities” (Day 22)
3. To discourage attending school while receiving welfare (Day 54)
4. To “promote the attitude that it is reasonable for couples to consciously determine the number of children they wish to have and the timing of having them” (Day 45)
5. To “foster the attitude that American police are held accountable by the community for their actions and can be viewed as helpers of the individual and family” (Day 66)
6. To develop “the attitude that . . . the purchasing and use of second-hand items is appropriate” (Day 38)
PET Component (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1984)
1. To accept “the crucial stress on time in the American workplace” (p. 8)

FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCIES IN THE U.S. REFUGEE PROGRAM

655

2. To be conscious of safety standards on the job “since American employers expect employees to be safety conscious” (p. 9)
3. To “state how severe the unemployment situation is in the U.S. and why it will probably be necessary to take an entry level job” (p. 265)
4. To measure one’s success in resettlement in terms of one’s .job (pp. 266-267)
ESL Component (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1963a)
1. To “identify common entry level jobs which can be held by those with limited English ability” (pp. 31-32)
2. To “answer basic direct questions about pay, work availability, and hours. (Is $4.00 an hour OK? Yes. When can you start? Tomorrow. Can you work nights? Yes.)” (pp. 31-32)
3. To “respond appropriately to an employer’s decision about a job. . . ([I’m sorry. We cannot hire you.] Do you have any other opening?)” (pp. 31-32)
4. To “ask if a task was done correctly. (Is this right?)” (pp. 33-34)
5. To “respond appropriately to supervisor’s comments about quality of work on the job including mistakes, working too slowly, and incomplete work. (I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.)” (pp. 33-34)
6. To “ask about appropriateness of actions according to customs/ culture in the U.S. (Is it all right to wear my shoes in the house?)” (pp. 46-47)
7. To “ask permission to use or do something. (Can I smoke here? Can I use the phone?)” (pp. 46-47)
8. To “rephrase instructions to verify comprehension” (p. 2$)
9. To “identify which part of instructions or explanations was not understood. (I don’t understand what to do after I put these away.)” (p. 26)
10. To “read and respond appropriately to written communication from a school (e.g., permission forms)” (p. 29)
11. To “report and describe a crime/emergency to police/proper authorities. Write a note or call to explain an absence from school” (p. 29)
These competencies, as well as many others in the RPC curricula, encourage refugees to consider themselves fortunate to find minimum-wage employment, regardless of their previous education. Moreover, the competencies attempt to inculcate attitudes and

656

TESOL QUARTERLY

values that will make refugees passive citizens who comply rather than complain, accept rather than resist, and apologize rather than disagree.
For example, refugees are taught to respond properly to all notes
from their children’s teachers, but not how to complain when their
children’s English language education is inadequate. Refugees are taught to accommodate employers’ needs and to feel fortunate when offered a night job paying minimum wage, but not what to do when an employer violates employee protection laws. Refugees are taught to care for their apartment in order not to anger the landlord
or other tenants, but not what to do when the landlord violates housing, safety, or health regulations or laws barring discrimination in housing. Auerbach and Burgess (1985) describe similar limitations in many “survival ESL” texts, though some programs (e.g., ESL
Core Group, 1983) have developed curricula that express different attitudes and values and that aim to provide refugees with a different set of skills.
It should be mentioned that although RPC curricula emphasize values, curricular objectives also have other aims. For instance, several lessons are designed to orient refugees to the RPCS, focusing on information about agencies and procedures. Some objectives seem to contradict the general implicit emphasis on passivity evident in the sample objectives listed here. In the Philippine CO curriculum, for example, lessons encourage refugees to join a Mutual Assistance Association (MAA) in the United States. Materials for this lesson, however, focus solely on the role of MAAs in organizing social gatherings and New Year’s celebrations.
Even objectives which are apparently value-free may become
value-laden in the classroom. One objective of the CO curriculum is to develop the strategy of observing other workers on the job in order to understand appropriate work behavior. Materials commonly used for this lesson, however, include the advice that “your supervisor will always like to see you work hard and work well. If you’re a good worker you have a better chance of keeping your job or of moving up to a higher level job” (International Catholic Migration Commission, 1985, Unit 11, p. 1).
Curricular objectives are also mediated by teachers’ values and attitudes. As a result, determining the proportion of RPC objectives which encourage refugees to be passive or to play a particular social role in American society cannot be done with precision, though I would estimate that one third of the objectives in the Philippine CO curriculum fall into this category, while one third are primarily informational. Most other objectives (e. g., to familiarize students with the resettlement process) normally become value-laden when

FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCIES IN THE U.S. REFUGEE PROGRAM

657

taught, with the teachers’ values rather than the objectives themselves being the central variable.
Like most competency-based programs (see Kasworm, 1980), the RPC program claims that refugees’ needs form the basis for
decisions about competency lists, yet this merely shifts values from curriculum development to needs assessment. For example, it is well known that refugees employed in the underground economy lack certain legal protections (North, 1984, pp. 16-18) and that refugees often receive inadequate ESL training, yet RPC curricula do not include competencies to prepare refugees for these problems. Most important, there is no evidence that adoption of any particular set of values or attitudes aids refugees’ resettlement in any way. The values and attitudes emphasized in RPC curricula are believed by RPC staff to be essential for refugees in the United States, but there is no empirical evidence for this belief.
In sum, the RPC curricula illustrate the current inadequacy of the theoretical basis for functional curriculum development. Because the only procedure for determining the specific competencies to be included in a curriculum involves asking individuals for their views, functional curricula easily reflect the values and attitudes of individuals making curricular decisions. Despite this problem, the test of the functional approach is whether learners become functionally competent and program goals are achieved. This question involves the issue of assessment of functional competence.

Assessment of Functional Competence
Functional competency tests have been developed for many programs, including refugee programs in the United States, which use the Mainstream English Language Training system, and the RPCS, which use tests developed by the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL). The theoretical problems which underlie curriculum development also have serious consequences for efforts to validate tests of functional competence. The RPC testing program illustrates these difficulties.
The RPC testing program is designed to assess “proficiency on skills that are essential to survival in the U. S.” (Oxford-Carpenter, 1985, p. Al). These skills consist of four broad types: ESL listening and speaking, ESL reading and writing, cultural adaptation, and preemployment. The four skill areas are assessed by the following tests: the intensive ESL Core Test for Listening and Speaking (known as the Core Test), the Reading and Writing Test, the CO Test, and the PET Test. All tests assess functional competence, also called survival competencies (Oxford-Carpenter, 1985, p. Al).

658

TESOL QUARTERLY

The content validity of functional tests depends upon the process
by which test items are developed. The process for developing RPC
tests involved asking staff in the RPCS and in refugee programs in
the United States for their recommendations. Job developers, job counselors, and employers of refugees were also consulted for the PET test. In addition, items from the Basic English Skills Test (Center for Applied Linguistics, 1982) were adapted for the RPC tests, and the latter have been revised several times, most recently in 1985. This process for deciding test content closely resembles the curriculum development process. In short, the content validity of the tests rests upon the judgment and beliefs of the individuals consulted.
The construct being assessed is functional competence, the logical basis for which is as follows: (a) Refugees who have greater functional competence do better at surviving in the United States; (b) refugees who do better at surviving perform better on the RPC tests than those who do worse at surviving; (c) therefore, refugees who are more functionally competent perform better on RPC tests than those who are less competent. Thus, to prove that RPC tests assess functional competence, it is necessary to demonstrate that performance on the tests is positively correlated with “survival” (i.e., with successful resettlement).
Though several measures of resettlement success are possible, such as physical and mental health, family reunification, or maintenance of native language and culture, the appropriate measures for the RPC program are its stated criteria: refugees’ rates of employment and need for public assistance. CAL reports on RPC tests do not, however, include correlations between test results and any measure of resettlement success. Thus, the construct validity of RPC functional tests has not been established. In fact, the latest CAL testing report (Oxford-Carpenter, 1985) suggests the difficulties involved in establishing test scores that will predict the probability of successful resettlement:
There is no “standard of acceptable proficiency” (i.e., passing score) established across ethnic groups on any of the tests. . . . Setting such a score would take a very large study involving validation of the score in a variety of U.S. situations with arriving refugees from all ethnic groups. Such a study might, in fact, indicate the need for many different passing scores, depending on the varying English language requirements of individual refugees and groups of refugees in their new land. In short, this type of effort does not appear to be a useful one. (p. A3)

659

Furthermore, because it cannot be claimed that performance on the
tests correlates with any measure of resettlement success, there is no basis for establishing the empirical validity of the tests.
As the CAL report suggests, establishing construct and empirical validity for any realistic set of functional competencies often requires a complex (and expensive) validation study. Again, the RPC program illustrates this problem. Refugees’ unemployment and public assistance rates are affected by many factors, only one of which is refugees’ functional competence. To measure the effect of RPC instruction on employment and public assistance rates, two questions must be answered: (a) Has there been any change in refugees’ employment/public assistance rates since the RPC program began in late 1980? and (b) What other factors can account for changes in employment/public assistance rates besides refugees’ functional competence?
The data base for generalizations about refugees’ employment and use of public assistance is generally inadequate, due to incomplete data and periodic changes in data-collection procedures (see North, 1984, pp. B1-B2). Nevertheless, general trends suggest that no reduction in these rates can be traced to the RPC program. There appears to be no difference between employment rates of refugees who have completed RPC classes and those who have not (RMC Research Corporation, 1984, p. 142), and the proportion of Indochinese refugees requiring public assistance has remained high since the late 1970s (Bach, 1984, p. 1; North, 1984, pp. 28, 33). Moreover, there is some evidence that refugees who have completed RPC classes participate in cash assistance programs at the same rate as those who have not taken classes (RMC Research Corporation, 1984, p. 75).
These findings do not necessarily mean, however, that refugees have failed to become competent in the areas covered by RPC curricula. Rather, unemployment and public assistance rates may be better explained by other factors. The most important analysis of refugee employment to date (Bach, 1984) rejects the “mythology” in which “refugees’ problems in achieving self-sufficiency [are] interpreted as refugees’ lack of, or poor progress toward, learning American values, including its work ethic” (p. 36). This study argues that refugees occupy “a position in the U.S. labor market comparable to other ethnic minorities and recent immigrant groups” whose employment difficulties “belong to the general nature of the U.S. labor market. We probably should not expect the refugees to overcome these broader structural problems” (pp. 8788) .

Taken together, these findings point to a serious difficulty with the functional, competency-based approach: Without a validated list of the functional competencies required for “proficient adult living” or for “successful resettlement” and without a validated test to assess progress in those functional competencies, it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of functional programs in terms of stated goals such as employment and public assistance rates.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This analysis of curricula in the RPCS outlines theoretical deficiencies in curriculum development that lead to a central role for values, technical problems in demonstrating an association between curricular objectives and explicit criteria for selecting competencies, and theoretical and practical difficulties in validating tests of functional competence. Specifically, four problems with the functional, competency-based approach have been identified:
1. Functional curricula are intended to achieve specified goals, such as success in resettlement, in graduate school, or in finding and keeping a job. Yet the only methodology for determining the specific competencies required for these purposes involves asking individuals to decide which competencies seem essential. There is no methodology to discover essential competencies through systematic application of theory or scientific data and processes.
2. As a result, functional curricula often reflect the values and attitudes of individuals making curricular decisions, even when there is no empirical evidence that their values and attitudes are associated with “success,” however it is defined.
3. Assessment of functional competence requires validation of tests of functional competence, yet the methodology for selecting test items involves asking individuals for their recommendations. In short, functional tests and functional competency lists share the same weak foundation.
4. In addition, validation of tests requires demonstrating empirically that performance on tests is associated with stated criteria, such as employment rates or grades in school. Yet such criteria are normally affected by factors other than learners’ competence, and thus validation of tests may require a highly complex factor analysis. Even the well-funded U.S. Refugee Program, recognizing this difficulty, has not attempted such a project.

The U.S. Refugee Program has expended unprecedented funds
for overseas refugee education, yet these crucial problems persist with its functional approach. To some extent, these difficulties become greater in large programs with inexperienced instructional and curricular managers, but they are primarily a result of difficulties inherent in functional, competency-based curricula. Nor can these problems be solved easily by analysis of learners’ needs. In the United States, there are nearly 1 million resettled refugees whose differing educational, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds, as well as resettlement experiences, make needs analysis unfeasible. Moreover, the central, though implicit, role of values is also present in needs analysis.
One alternative approach offering a solid theoretical basis for
determining curricular objectives is a grammar-based curriculum, but it has well-known disadvantages (Wilkins, 1976). Nevertheless, a grammar-based curriculum is advocated by curriculum managers in the Philippine RPC (see Walsh, 1985). A second, promising alternative, a task-based approach (Long, 1983), requires additional study to clarify the basis for selecting tasks. Though some staff at the Philippine RPC have made efforts to adopt a task-based curriculum, opposition to this approach is intense among instructional managers, who expect curricula to include measurable behavorial objectives. Thus, a proposed task-based PET curriculum was criticized because
it is not clear what the learner will be able to do by the end of the lesson. . . . Rarely are the objectives specific enough . . . to know exactly what the purpose of the lesson is and how its success might be measured. (Opel, 1985)
Efforts to adopt task-based curricula have been more successful in the smaller RPCS in Thailand and Indonesia.
Thus, the current state of ESL curriculum development does not suggest that functional curricula should be replaced by an alternative approach. Rather, what is needed is an examination of (a) the criteria for establishing curricular objectives in current programs, (b) the values implicit in curricula, (c) the adequacy of current tests of functional competence, and (d) the social implications of value-based competency lists. Only critical analysis of these issues will lead to theoretically sound and socially responsible approaches to curriculum development.

Tense, Aspect, and Time in the English Modality System
JEANETTE S. DeCARRICO Portland State University
A major problem in ESL instruction on the English modality system is that grammar texts do not adequately clarify past time relationships. Without this clarification, students presented with hypothetical past or past conditional forms (modal+ have+ past participle) are likely to infer (from the form) the past time frame associated with present perfect aspect (i.e., I have seen that movie = unspecified past, with current relevance; see Moy, 1977). This article argues that unless a clear distinction is made between the semantic time reference of the modal “perfect” and that of the present perfect aspect, these forms will remain a major source of confusion for ESL students. The article includes a brief suggested sequence for teaching modals which incorporates and clarifies these time relationships and thus simplifies the teaching of the entire modality system.
Modern ESL grammar texts generally present fairly clear explanations of present and future time relationships in modal contexts. Several of the more recent texts also initially stress function over form, and since modal concepts are apparently universal (see Horn, 1972, and Steele, 1975, on the universal nature of modal concepts), students begin with concepts they already know and then proceed to learn the forms used to express them in English. These include epistemic modals of logical possibility, such as may, might, could, and must, and deontic (i.e., “root”) modals, such as should, ought to, be able to, and so on.
However, ESL texts do not generally provide adequate explanations of past time relationships in modal contexts, that is, the hypothetical past or past conditional, as in I would have helped you, but I was busy or If you had asked me, I would have helped you. In the view of many ESL teachers, these cases present the most difficulty for students, including those who are able to gain full mastery of the semantics, functions, and forms of modals used in present tense, such as I would help you, but I am busy or It might
665

rain today. (The semantics of modals is not a major concern in this
discussion; for a detailed analysis of the semantics of modal expressions, see Perkins, 1983.)
To illustrate, consider incorrect past time sentences like the following, written by advanced ESL students: I would had gone to
a special school for boys; It’s not possible for me to tell how many changes I would had in my way of growing up; or even (in a past time context), Sometimes, my mother might tell me to help cook the
dinner. The students’ in-class writing assignment had been to tell how their lives as children would have been different if they had been born of the opposite sex. Most of the students had similar kinds of difficulties with the assignment, even though in their grammar courses they had studied modals at some length, both present tense and hypothetical past, and had earlier been successful in mastering the present tense forms.
It is my contention that a major source of this difficulty results from presenting the hypothetical past forms, that is, the modal + have + past participle, without clarifying the precise nature of the
past in terms of the actual time frame. For example, in Fingado, Freeman, Jerome, and Summers (1981), the present perfect aspect is introduced first, with the explanation that “the word perfect means a completed action” and that “when we want to ask if something has happened at any time between a time in the past [italics added] and the present, we use the simple present perfect” (p. 260). Later, the hypothetical past forms, referred to as the “modal perfects,” are introduced as the forms of modals to use “when you talk about the past [italics added]” (p. 312).
Similarly, Davis (1977) presents the simple present perfect as “used for an action which has been completed at some indefinite moment before now [italics added]” (p. 89) and in a later lesson presents “the modal perfect auxiliaries with past [italics added] meaning” as “modal perfect verb phrases [which] refer to past time whenever the context is not clearly future [italics added]’” (p. 130). The problem is that this leaves students to infer from the form (have + past participle) that the hypothetical past form is the past time frame associated with the present perfect aspect, namely, the unspecified (or “unstated”), indefinite past meaning of present perfect sentences such as I have seen that movie. A further question to consider is why this confusion of indefinite past time versus definite past time causes such serious difficulty.
The purpose of this article is to show that these so-called modal perfects (the form of modal+ have+ past participle) normally bear no relation to the past time of present perfect aspect; rather, they indicate simple past time. That is, they indicate a definite time in the

666

TESOL QUARTERLY

past. A further argument is that confusion on this point is a major stumbling block for students attempting to master the modal perfect functions.

TENSE AND ASPECT VERSUS TIME
The first problem to be considered, then, is that of tense and aspect versus actual time. Unfortunately, ESL texts and other source material sometimes use these terms in different ways. Many texts refer to tense and aspect (or alternatively, refer to both as tense) and to time without clearly defining them. Fingado et al. (1981), for instance, introduce present perfect by stating that “this tense is called the simple present perfect tense because it expresses a connection between the present and the past” (p. 260), but they do not clarify that tense refers to form, whereas present and past refer to actual time.
A rare exception is Marquez and Bowen (1983), who do make a clear distinction between tense and time, stating that “tense is a grammatical term referring to the form of the verb in relation to the meaning of the sentence and/or the other parts of the sentence, like
adverbs of time,” while “time refers to clock time in our physical world” (p. 68). Bull (1960) also makes a careful distinction between time and tense in the sense intended here. He refers to time in terms of calendar systems and points out that the content element is a time interval, which is also defined by its position in the series. That is, it is modified by a disguised scalar. However, in terms of tense systems, the content element is an event, which is not position bound and not defined by a scalar.
In the interest of clarity, then, in this article tense and aspect are taken to mean the forms that verbs take; time is taken to mean the semantics of a particular time frame, or in other words, the meaning of the conceptual time frame. This time frame indicates clock time, in the sense of Marquez and Bowen (1983), as measured by clocks, calendars, or other such devices. So, for example, a verb like visited, as in Bill visited London in 1920, is past tense by virtue of its -ed suffix. And a verb phrase like has visited, as in Bill has visited London, is the aspect of present perfect, by virtue of a paraphrastic device, the present tense form of the have auxiliary, combined with the inflected form of the verb (see Chomsky, 1965, for detailed syntactic definitions of tense and aspect).
With respect to present perfect, Moy (1977) maintains that the tense of the present perfect is the present, whereas the perfect part refers to an aspect. Thus, present perfect would be considered a tense-aspect form. However, ESL texts commonly refer to it as

THE ENGLISH MODALITY SYSTEM

I

present perfect tense, as for instance in Fingado et al. (1981). While
Moy’s distinction is an important one–and one with which I concur—in the interest of brevity, this form is simply referred to here as present perfect aspect, following Chomsky (1965).
Notice that these definitions are strictly formal. For clarity, semantics must also be considered. In the sentence Bill visited London in 1920, the actual or conceptual time frame is a specific time in the past, namely the year 1920. In the sentence, Bill has visited London, the actual time is also past, although now a specific date is not mentioned. Therefore, the semantics of the time frame is something closer to “sometime or other in the past,” up to the moment of speaking.
A crucial difference, however, is that although both sentences are in some sense past, the sentence Bill visited London in 1920 will be true at any given time, even in the future, regardless of the speaker or the moment of speaking. Conversely, the sentence Bill has visited London will only be true if uttered during Bill’s lifetime and if it happened sometime before the moment of speaking. It will not be true 100 years from now. So, for instance, it would not make any sense in 1986 to say Abraham Lincoln has visited London. For tense and aspect versus actual time, definitions can be given in similar ways for the past perfect aspect and for progressive aspects.
To return to the main point, the basic problem seems to be that in ESL grammar texts, the systematic nature of the forms and of the semantics with respect to time relationships is either not explained adequately or is simply left vague. For instance, hypothetical past is normally introduced after lessons on simple past and present perfect. The modals for hypothetical past are then presented as “modal perfects,” as in the references cited above, or alternatively, are simply presented as “past forms.” For example, Azar (1981, p. 154), presents modal+ have+ past participle as the past form of modals like should, and Praninskas (1975) refers to past forms as those like should, would, or might, adding the cautionary note that “the form of the modal does not necessarily indicate the time reference of the sentence in which it is used (p. 234).
Even Marquez and Bowen (1983), who make careful distinctions between time and tense for other forms, do not clarify this distinction with respect to the hypothetical past. Instead, they revert to the rather vague explanation that “there is only a weak correspondence between time and tense of modal forms” and that “past tense forms (should, would, could, might) often refer to present or future time,” although “sometimes they refer to past time, but not regularly, like other past tense verb forms” (p. 69). In the typical case, then, students first learn forms like those in

668

TESOL QUARTERLY

Examples 1 and 2 below, the simple past and present perfect, respectively, and then forms like the one in Example 3, the hypothetical past.
1. I visited London in 1980. 2. I have visited London. 3. I would have visited London, but I was too busy.
Similar instructions are usually given for past conditionals. In some texts, the past conditional explanation adds even more to the confusion, as in Praninskas (1975), whose description reads that “past conditions are stated in the past perfect tense” and that “the result clause includes would, could, or might, and is expressed in the present perfect tense [italics added]” (p. 327). Such instructions are not only confusing, but misleading as well. The reason is that the actual time frames of the modal perfect and the present perfect are in no way similar.
The Modal Simple Past
In past time frames, modals rarely occur in perfect aspect contexts, with respect to the semantics of actual time, but instead are normally restricted to simple past contexts, that is, those which indicate a definite past time. So, for instance, the sentence in Example 3 clearly indicates a simple past context and could occur quite naturally in a conversation in which I had just been talking about, say, my disappointment that I was not able to travel last year. The implied time frame in Example 3 would then be at that time. Yet, unless instructed otherwise, students may well infer, incorrectly, that the time frame for a sentence like Example 3 is the same as that for Example 2—the present perfect.
Furthermore, modals like the one in Example 3 also occur with definite past time expressions like yesterday or ago. The sentences below illustrate this point.

Examples 4 and 5 show that time expressions like yesterday and ago can occur only with the simple past and can never occur with the

THE ENGLISH MODALITY SYSTEM

669

present perfect. The reason is that the semantics of definite time
expressions like these fit only with the semantics of the simple past and are incompatible with the semantics of the unstated, indefinite past of the present perfect aspect. Thus, Example 5 is ungrammatical (which is indicated here and in subsequent examples with an
asterisk). On the other hand, Example 6 shows that these past time
expressions are entirely compatible with the modal context, the hypothetical past. Small wonder, then, that students often become
confused at this point: In one chapter they are instructed to use such time expressions only with simple past, and in a later chapter—
without further explanation—they are presented with examples of them being used with the “perfect” modals.
For example, in Fingado et al. (1981), the use of present perfect to express the “unstated past” is presented in chapter 16. After giving examples like “Marriage patterns in the United States have changed a great deal” (p. 266), the authors state that “we cannot use the term simple present perfect when we use a past tense time
expression such as a week ago, yesterdaq, last year, in 1965,” but instead, “we must use the simple past tense,” as for instance in “In
1968 the divorce laws changed radically in New York” (p. 266).
Then in chapter 19 the first example to introduce the modal perfects occurs in a dialogue (about skydiving) as follows: “He made his first and last jump yesterday [italics added]. He must have been terrified” (p. 311). Although the time expression yesterday does not occur in the same sentence with the modal expression, its
occurrence in the previous sentence clearly establishes a context such that the modal expression can only be interpreted as meaning at that time, that is, yesterday.
Other texts, like Frank (1972), do give illustrations in which
hypothetical modal expressions and past time expressions occur in
the same sentence, as in “Mr. Johnson should have gone to the dentist yesterday” (p. 98), or as in the example from Praninskas (1975), “I should have read my assignment yesterday” (p. 237). Again, however, no explanation is given. Thus, students are left to infer from the form that these perfect modals indicate a present perfect time frame but with the confusing difference that, unlike other present perfect forms, for some reason these perfect forms seem to co-occur with definite past time expressions. It is not surprising that some students simply give up on learning to use modals and instead try to learn ways to avoid using them altogether.
It is well known that these perfect modals indicate some type of past time (see, for instance, Celce-Murcia & Larsen-Freeman, 1983; Fingado et al., 1981; Pence & Emery, 1963). However, sentences like those in Examples 4-6 show that this time frame, illustrated in

670

TESOL QUARTERLY

Example 6, bears no relation semantically to the past time frame of present perfect, the meaning of the indefinite past in Example 5. In other words, although have gone is similar in form to should have gone, it is not similar in meaning, with respect to the actual time frame.
A much simpler, and a much more accurate, explanation is that modals in past contexts are normally restricted to one time frame, in terms of actual time. That time frame is the definite, or simple, past time. Further, the single formula of modal + have+ past participle is the invariant form used for this simple past frame, hereafter referred to as the modal simple past. And this is so whether it is the hypothetical past, as in Example 6, or the past conditional (with very few exceptions, to be discussed shortly).
It is important to point out the place of these modal forms in a well-known, larger generalization about English, namely, that all nonfinite clauses use have . . . EN to signal past time, including gerunds, infinitives, and participial clauses. For example, past time in the participial clause reading that book would be expressed as having read in a sentence like Having read that book, I now want to see the movie. However, this generalization in no way detracts from the present argument concerning the semantics of have . . . EN in a particular type of expression, namely, a modal expression, with respect to the actual time frame involved. (While the theoretical issue—whether modal perfect is to be considered a part of the modal system or a part of the larger context of tenseless expressions of past time—is indeed an interesting one, further discussion of this issue is well beyond the scope of this article.)
So far my argument, based on Examples 4-6, has been that modal past contexts are in fact the modal simple past. It is easy to demonstrate that the expressions yesterday and ago are semantically compatible not only with the modal simple past but also with the full range of simple past time expressions. Noting that “because of a different time perspective the simple past and the present perfect correlate with different sets of time expressions,” Wohl (1978, p. 14) lists (in addition to yesterday and ago) the simple past
671

Like Examples 5 and 6 above, Example 8 shows that all of these expressions are incompatible with the present perfect but entirely compatible with the modal simple past. (Azar, 1981, is the only text I know of which explicitly states that the “past form” of modals can
be used with definite time expressions like last night, yesterday, etc. However, once again no explanation is given as to why these expressions can be used with the perfect form have + EN.)

Finally, as further evidence that in the past, modal contexts normally indicate simple past time frames, consider the sentences in Examples 10-12.
10. After he had read the book, he went to see the movie. 11. *After he had read the book, he has gone to see the movie. 12. If he had read the book, he would have gone to see the movie.
Past perfect clauses, as in the first clause of Example 10, are another type of construction that can occur only with the simple past, and not with the present perfect. The contrast of Examples 10 and 11 illustrates this point. But again, Example 12 shows that the past perfect clause can occur quite naturally with the modal past context.

Past Conditionals
Before leaving the general problem of actual time frames, one more important difficulty should be pointed out. If we do not accept the hypothetical past and modal perfect forms as the forms for the modal simple past meaning, that leaves us with no clear

672

TESOL QUARTERLY

explanation as to why past perfect occurs in a past conditional clause when a modal occurs in the main clause.
For example, look again at Examples 10-12. Recall that Example 11 illustrates the incompatibility of the past perfect and the unstated past time frame of the present perfect. Now consider again the past conditional in Example 12. If we assume that the formula of modal + have+ past participle in the main clause merely indicates simple past time, then we have a perfectly natural and systematic explanation for why the past perfect occurs in the if-clause. That is, the past perfect, together with the simple past, is what is normally used when two events occur in the past, one of which occurs before the other.
In Example 10 the event in the adverbial clause precedes in time the event in the main clause. Similarly, in conditionals like Example 12, the event or state in the condition normally precedes in time the event or state in the main clause. In other words, the condition must be satisfied first. (Although strictly speaking this may not always be the case, such sentences are normally interpreted in this way.) As further illustration, consider the sentence below, the “real” conditional of future time.
13. If you buy a turkey for Thanksgiving, I will cook it.
In this case the buying must precede the cooking; otherwise you will not get the dinner.
This is similar to the following sentence in the hypothetical past.
14. If you had mowed my lawn for me, I would have paid you $5.
The normal interpretation is that the event of mowing must precede in time the event of paying. The difference in this case, of course, is that the mowing did not occur, and therefore neither did the paying. The point, however, is simply that the actual time frames of the clauses in Examples 12 and 14 are exactly the same as in the past perfect/simple past time of Example 10, After he had read the book, he went to see the movie, with the time frame of the adverbial clause preceding that of the main clause. On the assumption that the form of modal + have + past participle indicates a simple past time frame, the past perfect in the if-clause is exactly what would be predicted in Examples 12 and 14. Incidentally, with this explanation we can tell ESL students that they have nothing new to learn here in past conditionals (assuming of course, that they have already learned the past perfect aspect). With the modal simple past in the main clause, the past perfect occurs in the other clause, as usual.

THE ENGLISH MODALITY SYSTEM

673

It should be noted that in certain contexts, present perfect meaning can be pragmatically forced, as in He should have been here by now. (Compare He should have been at the lecture, i n which the normal modal simple past is the only possible interpretation with no time expression at all. ) There appear to be very few cases like this, however, and this has no real bearing on the general argument, since other simple past forms, too, can have a present perfect time frame imposed by the context. For example, I
shot the cat is simple past in both form and meaning, but the same form can have a present perfect meaning of “recently” forced if just— a time expression associated with present perfect—is added as special context. Therefore, I just shot the cat can be an informal version of I have shot the cat or, alternatively, I have just shot the cat.

IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING ENGLISH MODALITY
The preceding discussion has certain implications for approaches to teaching modals—approaches which can take advantage of what is systematic and predictable about English modality. Modality in English is relatively simple and orderly with respect to the overall system of time relationships, and teaching techniques should stress this fairly straightforward system.
To see how this might be done, let us consider first the framework proposed by Bull (1960) and some later modifications of his framework as applied to English. Bull developed a system based on what he terms universal axes of orientation. The act of speaking is viewed as the prime point of orientation for all tense systems, and it “can be used to classify all other events in terms of three possible order relations . . . that is, either anterior to, simultaneous with, or posterior to the axis of orientation” (p. 13). While Bull worked mainly with specific applications to Spanish, others, like Tregidgo (1974) and Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman (1983), have shown that his system can be modified and adapted to apply to English.
Tregidgo (1974) suggests the following modification of Bull’s diagram, as applied to English (see Figure 1). According to Tregidgo,
The four horizontal lines in this diagram represent four main times (in Bull’s terminology four “axes of orientation”) corresponding to what we might call (1) present, (2) past, (3) future, and (4) future-in-the-past. Each of these times has three aspects: a negative backward-looking aspect, a positive forward-looking one (i.e. a “before” and an “after” aspect), and a main neutral aspect in the middle. There are thus twelve “slots” altogether, eight of which are here occupied by appropriate

674

TESOL QUARTERLY

forms of the verb do. The remaining four slots have no real formal realisation in English. (p. 98)
FIGURE 1 Tregidgo’s Adaptation of Bull's (1960) Diagram of
Time, Tense, and the English Verb System

Tregidgo’s adaptation contributes significant insights concerning time relationships in English. Following Bull, he argues, for example, that the English present perfect is not a sort of past tense looking forward into the present but is instead, as Bull stated, a present tense looking backward into the past. Despite these important insights, however, his arguments concerning the fourth horizontal line, labeled future-in-the-past, are quite misleading, as Examples 4-12 show. He includes this form when he states that “all these forms with have are backward-looking or retrospective” (p. 99). He later notes that the past tense in English
always refers to the definite past, i.e. the speaker chooses it only when he is referring to a wholly past time which he either defines himself, e.g. by an expression such as yesterday or last year, or which is somehow defined for him by the context. (p. 100)
The present perfect, on the other hand, “refers either to a period of time extending up to the present . . . or to a wholly past moment or period which . . . is undefined” (p. 100).
But by Tregidgo’s own definition, Examples 6 and 8b, John and

THE ENGLISH MODALITY SYSTEM

675

Mary should have gone to the lecture yesterday and I should have gone there last week (and so on), are then past tense forms referring to the definite past. This suggests that for English, the fourth horizontal line in Figure 1 should be eliminated, simplifying the diagram to three lines. That is, the example form would have done, similar semantically to did with respect to the expression of definite past time, can simply be included in the same place in the second line as did, as an alternative definite past time form—the modal definite or modal simple past.
This point may be easier to see if we look at the version of the Bull framework adapted by Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman (1983). Their version, intended for use as a teaching device, illustrates, in a slightly different form, this relationship of past, present, and future to a basic time axis. Figure 2 presents a simplified version of their diagram. (The line for hypothetical past time, which I have added to my adaptation of their diagram, is discussed shortly.)
FIGURE 2 The Bull Framework (Adapted)

Again, the real key to this framework is the basic time axis, here presented in the center column. In this configuration, for the present time axis of orientation, the time before that basic time is the present perfect, or the unstated, indefinite past time frame. This

676

TESOL QUARTERLY

line, like Tregidgo’s line (l), demonstrates that in all of its uses the present perfect has a meaning in actual time of something like “up to now,” or “up to the moment of speaking,” and in this sense is dependent on the present moment—the basic axis—for its meaning (or in Tregidgo’s terms, a looking backward to an indefinite past time, sometime before the moment of speaking).
For the past time line, the time before the past time is the past perfect. This line shows that the past perfect indicates an event or state occurring at a time earlier than a second event or state in a given past time. It is in this sense dependent on the time frame of the second event for its own time frame, which is relative to the specific time set by the basic time axis, the simple past.
Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman do not attempt to fit the hypothetical past or past conditional into this framework, nor is the framework mentioned again in their later chapter on past conditionals. However, on the basis of the assumptions presented in this article, the conditional sentence in Example 14 fits into this symmetrical system perfectly and can be placed on the same line as the past time axis (see Figure 2). We have simple past for the basic axis, that is, the modal simple past (I would have paid you $5), and past perfect (If you had mowed my lawn for me) as the time before that time, as usual. And of course the same applies to Example 12 or to any other past conditional or past hypothetical. For instance, for the hypothetical in Example 15, both clauses would simply fit on the past time line in the basic axis time column, thus indicating simultaneous events.
15. I would have helped him, but I was busy (at that time).
The conceptual time frame in this case is analogous to the simple past used for two simultaneous events or states, as illustrated in Example 16.
16. I helped him, but I didn’t enjoy it.
One further advantage of the Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman adaptation of the Bull framework is that it can be greatly simplified for individual lessons in which only one particular construction is being taught or in which two constructions are being compared for the purpose of showing their similarities or differences, as in Figure 3.
1 It should be noted that these remarks apply only to sentences containing modal expressions. In past conditionals like If Sally said “sing,” Bill sang or If you had fun, you had fun!, containing no modal expressions, the above conclusions concerning tense sequence in past conditionals do not necessarily apply.

THE ENGLISH MODALITY SYSTEM

677

FIGURE 3 The Past Perfect/Past Conditional Parallel

A SUGGESTED SEQUENCE FOR TEACHING THE ENGLISH MODALITY SYSTEM
The following five-step sequence for teaching the English modality system reflects the system described above.
1. Teach modals in meaning groups, stressing the function and the universal meanings conveyed by each group.
2. As each group is taught, give only the present forms of all regular modals, based on the formula of modal + V (base form), but include the past form for the irregular ones, one at a time as they are taught.
3. Teach the present conditional. 4. Teach the hypothetical past, stressing that the actual time frame
is the modal simple past and that the pattern of modal + have + past participle indicates modal simple past for all regular modals. 5. Teach past conditionals, stressing that nothing new needs to be learned about time relationships or about modal forms. The time relationships and the formula are the same as for the hypothetical past, but the past perfect occurs in the conditional clause, just as in any other past perfect context.
In Step 1, for example, the functional category for expressing possibility should include may, might, and could, since, for example, Mary may be in the library, Mary might be in the library, or Mary could be in the library are roughly synonymous. (See Fingado et al., 1981, for an approach that stresses such functional categories in presenting tense modality.)

678

TESOL QUARTERLY

Bowen and McCreary’s (1977) techniques for engaging a class in communicative exercises could be adapted for teaching each category. Students could be told, for example, that sometimes we make guesses about present events when we are not at all sure what
the facts are. When we make such guesses, we say something may be the case, it might be the case, or it could be the case. Drawing a stick figure of Mary on the blackboard, the teacher could tell the class that Mary often studies in the library, visits with friends in the cafeteria, or practices in the language lab but that it is not known where Mary is at the moment. Next, using simple illustrations of the location, the teacher could write on the blackboard under the illustrations, Mary may be in the library, Mary might be in the cafeteria, Mary could be in the language lab. Finally, the teacher could ask the students to think of a friend or family member and to make guesses about where that person may, might, or could be at the moment (see Bowen & McCreary, p. 294).
In Step 2 (and Step 4), the term regular modals is used to mean those modals which form their simple past in the regular way with the formula of modal + have+ past participle. In this way, teachers can point out to students that the majority of modals behave in a systematic and predictable way and that only a few exceptions must be learned individually. Incidentally, with respect to past time, most modals which are sometimes considered irregular can be included in the regular group. The reason is simply that their past is formed in the usual way. This is illustrated in Figure 4. Furthermore, the two- and three-word modals are in any case no more irregular than the thousands of two-word verbs in English. For instance,
ought to or would like to are no more irregular than, say, listen to or put up with.
Notice also that any modal that has two meanings is listed separately as (1) and (2), thus stressing that they are to be considered two separate lexical items, just as with any other homonyms. So, for example, must (1) is listed in the category of probability, and must (2) is listed in the category of necessity, along with have to. However, this list is not exhaustive; its purpose is to illustrate the formal categories of the groups of modals usually included in ESL grammar texts.
Modals like those for permission or warning—may, can, had better, and the like—are not listed for the obvious reason that we do not give permission or warnings in the past. Furthermore, those modals listed as irregular should probably be pared down somewhat, since could (2), the past form for can, is simply a vestige of historical past forms and has a somewhat restricted usage. Likewise, would in its meaning of habitual past is highly restricted

THE ENGLISH MODALITY SYSTEM

679

FIGURE 4 Modals With Regular and Irregular Past Time Forms

in usage. (See Bowen & McCreary, 1977, for a detailed discussion of the simple present modal forms which do not have semantic
analogues in the past forms.) With this classification of regular and irregular modals in mind,
Step 2 in the sequence would simply be a matter of including these few irregular past forms as the categories of necessity and ability are presented in Step 1. For example, as must (2) and have to are taught for the function of expressing necessity—again assuming the type of communicative exercises discussed above—contexts requiring the past form had to can be added, with additional practice exercises contrasting the two contexts.
After teaching the present conditional in Step 3, teachers can move to Step 4, teaching the hypothetical past for all of the regular modals. Here they should stress that the actual time frame is (modal) simple past and that all of the regular modals have exactly the same form—modal + have + past participle—to indicate this
simple past time. It would be helpful to use time expressions like yesterday and ago to help students recognize the conceptual time frame of modal simple past. Bowen and McCreary (1977) offer

680

TESOL QUARTERLY

especially good examples of techniques for teaching hypothetical past. For must in the meaning of probability, for instance, students
can be given situations to speculate about, like “Geoffrey won the lottery two years ago’’(p. 292), and can then be asked to tell how he must have felt.2
In Step 5, the past conditional can be taught very simply as the past time form for the conditional covered in Step 3. The past conditionals require modals, but no new forms need be learned: The modal simple past occurs in the main clause and the past perfect occurs in the if- clause. The reason, as mentioned earlier, is that this time relationship is parallel to that of any other past perfect sentences: The event or state in the condition normally precedes in time the event or state in the main clause. Again utilizing Bowen and McCreary-type exercises, the functions that require this form can be illustrated and practiced, as with sentences like those in Example 14, If you had mowed my lawn for me, I would have paid you $5. After initial illustrations and practice in context, the chart in Figure 2 can be used as further illustration and as a summary or overview.
From the beginning of this five-step sequence, it should be stressed that the basic function of modal forms in English is simply to stress modal concepts, which are present in all languages (albeit expressed in very different forms, such as subjunctive forms of verbs, logical adjectives or adverbs, particles, sentential modifiers, etc.). The function of English modals—with the exception of will, the future maker—is to change the meaning of the verb from factual statement, as in He is there, to possibility, probability, advisability, obligation, and the like, as in He might be there. Their basic function is not to express some aspect of time relationship.
The preceding discussion emphasizes the need to distinguish clearly between tense and aspect as opposed to actual time. It is hoped that this discussion, together with the suggested teaching sequence in Steps 1-5, may serve to help students avoid this kind of confusion and to learn to express themselves with confidence in situations requiring modal concepts.

2 Although Bowen and McCreary'S (1977) article is cited several times here as an excellent source of information and practical teaching techniques, some aspects of it are open to the same kind of criticism mentioned earlier with respect to most ESL texts, namely, that past time relationships in modal contexts are not adequately explained.

Alternatives in Second Language Research: Three Articles on the State of the Art
Introduction
MIRIAM EISENSTEIN New York University
Research is just a set of conventions—the most rigorous way to ask a question and look for answers. . . . Research is people-run. And it can be as flexible as the people who run it. (Hatch & Farhady, 1982, p. xv)
The publication of Kuhn’s book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) reflected and inspired our interest in the explicit and implicit assumptions that characterize research. In the area of second language acquisition, a variety of approaches for data gathering and analysis have contributed to our knowledge, our questions, and our understanding. In this developing field, researchers have been examining the strengths and weaknesses of different models. To what extent can research alternatives be exploited in a positive sense? How can we avoid straying beyond the limitations and possibilities inherent in a particular research design?
The distinction between qualitative and quantitative research has been the subject of considerable attention. Patton (1978) characterizes the alternatives as follows:
[One] paradigm assures quantitative measurement, experimental design and multivariate, parametric statistical analysis. . . . The alternative paradigm relies on qualitative data, holistic analysis and detailed description derived from close contact with the targets of study. . . . These paradigms represent alternatives from which the active-reactive researcher can choose. (p. 187)
683

Sanders and Pinhey (1983, p. 355) stress that a main difference between quantitative and qualitative methods is that most decisions in quantitative research are made at the outset of the research
project, whereas in qualitative research, these decisions are made
during and after the data have been collected. Clearly, the question of whether observed phenomena should be
assigned numerical or categorical values (quantitative) or can be more appropriately described in an intuitive fashion (qualitative) is only one of a series of choices which the researcher must make in seeking to investigate language acquisition or language use. Experimental, quasi-experimental, descriptive, and ethnographic designs may be used for data gathering (Campbell& Stanley, 1966; Sanday, 1979). And overlapping approaches that incorporate elements of two or more viewpoints are possible and often desirable.
Language data may come from observation with or without the knowledge of the participant (or informant or subject) or can be
purposefully elicited from speakers. Elicitation situations may range from the production or manipulation of a phrase or sentence to naturalistic language use in particular social/psychological contexts (Berko, 1958; Fraser, Rintell, & Walters, 1980). Linguistic judgments of accuracy or appropriateness may be made by researchers or native informants. While generative grammarians have considered native-speaker intuitions to be reliable, others view
any judgment to be questionable when it requires a speaker/hearer to respond to language outside of its natural context and thus to make a conscious decision about what is naturally a subconscious process.
Labov (1972), in his discussion of “the observer’s paradox,” noted that “the aim of linguistic research in the community must be to find out how people talk when they are not being systematically observed, yet we can only obtain these data by systematic observation” (p. 209). In spite of the difficulty, Labov goes on to suggest strategies which will help investigators overcome this limitation.
Since Labov’s observation, variation in second language data has become an important issue for research and theory (see Krashen, 1981). Fluctuations in data have been attributed to variables such as first language transfer (Gass & Selinker, 1983), register and task (Tarone, 1979, 1985), investment in topic (Lantolf & Khanji, 1982), and target language variety (Eisenstein, 1982; Eisenstein & Verdi, 1985; Kachru, 1982; Smith, 1981). The importance of individual differences and separate paths for learning, cogently discussed by Huebner (1985), raises questions regarding the relative advantages

of longitudinal and cross-sectional research designs as well as of alternate forms of analysis such as implicational scales (Hyltenstam, 1977).
There is evidence for the effectiveness of many alternative approaches. In an insightful article, d’Anglejan and Renaud (1985) illustrate the potential of multivariate analysis to assess the relative contribution of a group of variables to individual differences in L2 performance and warn that researchers cannot infer causal relationships on the basis of univariate analyses. Carrasco (1981) reveals the power of ethnographic monitoring applied to the classroom setting. His study illustrates how insight from an ethnographic approach was crucial to the teacher’s and researcher’s understanding of a particular bilingual child. This caused the teacher’s behavior toward the child to change and contributed, happily, to the learner’s success.
Recognizing the potential inherent in differing research perspectives, Patton (1980) advocates a new paradigm, “a paradigm of choices,” which considers the appropriateness of different methods for particular situations. Phillips (1976) discusses the advantages of “triangulating” or integrating a number of different data techniques.
In an attempt to shed light on some of the questions raised regarding research design and analysis, the TESOL Research Interest Section invited three experts to address issues they considered important from their own perspectives. Nessa Wolfson (University of Pennsylvania) focuses on the contribution of ethnomethodology to language research and considers its potential for use in addition to other research paradigms. Grant Henning (University of California, Los Angeles) describes trends in the use of quantitative and nonquantitative methods in applied linguistics and suggests useful paradigms and procedures for future research in the field. Finally, Craig Chaudron (University of Hawaii) shows how quantitative and qualitative approaches can be and have been used in a complementary manner to provide insights into acquisition in classroom settings.

Research Methodology and the Question of Validity
NESSA WOLFSON University of Pennsylvania
The analysis of the rules of speaking for a specific speech community is the first step in understanding what it means to be communicatively competent among that group. We must have reliable descriptions of these rules and patterns in order to improve second language instruction and assessment. However, there are serious questions as to the best methods of gathering and analyzing the very data upon which such descriptions must rest. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different research approaches to the study of everyday speech behavior and hence to our understanding of communicative competence.
Methodology is one of the most basic questions for any discipline dealing with human interaction. Language learning and the acquisition of the rules for appropriate speech behavior are no exception. The questions of what constitutes data and how we treat data are fundamental to the entire enterprise of explaining and describing the acquisition of a second language, both from the point of view of linguistic and of sociolinguistic rules (or, recognizing that the two are inextricably interwoven, research into the acquisition of what has come to be known as communicative competence). No matter what else we do, we must remember that if data are inadequate, there is always the danger that the theory and conclusions drawn from them could be unreliable and misleading. For this reason, the question of data source must be kept open to constant examination and reexamination regarding its validity.
The approaches toward the gathering of data for linguistic analysis are roughly of two types: observation and elicitation. Within the category of elicitation, we can include all techniques in which subjects are aware that what they say (or in some cases, what they say they say) is being studied by an investigator. This category would include such widely differing techniques as the elicitation of
689

linguistic data from a single informant during many months or even
years of work sessions, from numerous subjects during one or more work sessions, or, as in the sociolinguistic studies of the 1960s and 1970s, from a large number of subjects in single interviews. Sociolinguistic data are also elicited through the use of carefully
designed questionnaires, both oral and written, and through the use of role plays.
There are many important differences among the techniques just mentioned, both with respect to the role of the subjects and with
regard to the researcher’s assumptions about the subjects’ consciousness of their role. All of these techniques, however, are subject to the linguistic truism that awareness of oneself as an object of study may endanger the validity of the data. This problem has been recognized from the first in descriptive linguistics and has been mentioned in numerous handbooks on linguistic fieldwork. What is not usually mentioned, however, is that the traditional method of descriptive linguists who gather their data by eliciting linguistic material and judgments from native-speaking informants is, in principle, not much different from introspection. The use of an informant (or even of several informants) must, by definition,
involve the use of native-speaker intuition. Even though the intuitions being elicited are those of someone other than the linguist,
what is being collected is still intuitive data, not speech as it actually occurs in everyday use.
Under the second heading, that of observation, we have fieldwork which may or may not involve participant observation. This approach toward the collection of data has its origins in anthropology, and many of the scholars who collect data in this way are anthropologists concerned with describing the speech behavior of groups of which they themselves are not members. Ethnographic fieldwork is not, however, limited to the study of groups foreign to the researcher. Increasingly, anthropologists and sociolinguists have
been investigating speech behavior among speakers of their own languages and, very often, among groups of which they are members. This focus gives participant observation new meaning, since the researcher is often not distinguishable from the group being studied and can observe everyday behavior without causing self-consciousness on the part of those being observed.
Each methodological approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and the collection of data from everyday interaction is no exception. The great disadvantages of collecting “naturalistic” data are that examples of a particular feature of speech behavior may occur so rarely or so unpredictably that large samples are difficult to come by. Even if a large body of data is collected and analyzed,

690

TESOL QUARTERLY

there really is no way to be certain how generalizable the findings are. Human behavior is not neat, and the factors that condition the patterns of everyday interaction are complex and dynamic. When one observes without intervening, then there is no real way of controlling for one variable or another.
This problem of not being able to control variables is not as difficult as it might appear, however. While it is true that much good qualitative research is characterized by nonintervention of the researcher, the researcher/analyst is expected to be very careful in examining the data, once it is collected, to see which of the possible variables might be conditioning the speech production. Thus, for example, factors in the everyday settings and in the relationships among speakers should be compared during the analysis to discover whether such differences may be having an effect on interlanguage production, on foreigner talk, or on the speech used among native
speakers in a particular group or society. As Labov (1966) and many others after him have demonstrated,
no one is a single-style speaker. Everyone has a range of styles and speech behaviors which vary with the interview task or with the circumstances in which naturalistic data are obtained. If this is true for native speakers, then it stands to reason, as Tarone (1979) has so clearly pointed out, that it is likely to be just as true for nonnative speakers. Thus, we can expect that the same nonnative speaker would produce different interlanguage, depending on the situation. Is the subject speaking to a teacher in a classroom full of other nonnative speakers? Is the subject speaking outside of class to a native speaker? Are the participants in the speech event status-
equals, or is the speaker of lower or higher status than the addressee? Are there other people involved in the interaction, either as an audience or as members of a social group? Is the context formal or informal? What is the purpose of the interaction? Is it a doctor’s appointment or a social gathering? What other sociolinguistic variables might be conditioning the interlanguage production?
In analyzing examples of interlanguage which have been collected in a variety of everyday settings, the researcher/analyst would need to determine carefully if different patterns emerge in different settings. To ignore such differences and to lump together all observed interlanguage would be to run the risk of losing important insights. Further, in comparing the interlanguage production of different nonnative speakers, it is extremely important to allow for different social attributes of the speakers themselves, as well as to avoid merging the various settings in which the speech took place. Beebe (1977, 1980, 1985) has made a point of looking at how performance varies with different interlocutors

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND VALIDITY

691

when the setting and tasks are controlled. Using Accommodation
Theory (see Beebe & Zuengler, 1983) to explain how speakers adjust their speech behavior to the social or ethnic identity of their addressee, Beebe has demonstrated that social factors are one of the most important sources of variation in second language performance.
Too often there is a tendency to forget the context in which speech was produced and to collapse data from studies in which the speech events were quite different. One of the most important insights of sociolinguistics is that people speak very differently in different situations. This is true for native speakers and must therefore be taken into account when examining the interlanguage of nonnative speakers. As T. Pica (personal communication) has remarked, there are many speech situations in which grammatically uninvested questions are produced by native speakers. To properly evaluate the uninvested questions found in interlanguage, we must first know what the context was. It is altogether possible that at least some of the utterances classified as errors of subject/auxiliary inversion are in fact target-like.
If there is variation in the production of interlanguage, then we must assume that foreigner talk is just as likely to vary with situation and interlocutor. Although the quality and quantity of input to nonnative speakers have long been recognized as having major implications in the study of second language acquisition, the phenomenon of sociolinguistic variation within foreigner talk has not yet become a focus of investigation. With respect to methodology, this is a clear case for an observational study of one or more native speakers interacting with a variety of nonnative speakers in a range of speech situations.
In a study which I have recently begun, a single native speaker of American English is being observed and recorded as he interacts spontaneously with the nonnative speakers with whom he comes into contact. Already, considerable variation has been noted in the foreigner talk of this single individual. Some of the more clear-cut factors conditioning variation have to do with context (at home or abroad, business negotiations or social conversation); with the age, sex, similarity of background and/or interests, and relative status of the nonnative-speaking interlocutor; with the length of acquaintance; and, most obviously perhaps, with the degree of proficiency in English of the nonnative speaker. This study will be expanded to observe other native speakers in a similar way and will then be followed by elicited self-report through interviews and discoursecompletion tests for comparison.

With respect to the study of variation in the speech patterns of native speakers interacting with one another, a large body of
sociolinguistic literature has been emerging over the last 20 years. Because they are interested in finding out how people speak in different situations, sociolinguists have been especially conscious of the methodological problems inherent in their work. Labov (1966, 1972), one of the first to emphasize the need for empirical data on everyday speech, writes of the “observer’s paradox.” What he means is that we, as sociolinguists, need to have data on how people
speak when we are not present. In addition to the difficulty of collecting data on unself-conscious
speech behavior, we must also confront the fact that the speaker’s intuitions are of limited reliability in our attempts to understand the patterns and conventions which condition speech behavior. This is because rules of speaking and, more generally, norms of interaction are not only culture-specific, they are also largely unconscious. What this means is that native speakers, although perfectly competent in using and interpreting the patterns of speech behavior which prevail in their own communities, are, with the exception of a few explicitly taught formulas, unaware of the patterned nature of their own speech behavior.
Native speakers are very well able to judge correctness and appropriateness of speech behavior in the everyday settings in which it occurs. When a rule is broken, when a nonnative speaker or a child says something which is incorrect or inappropriate, the native speaker recognizes the deviation. What native speakers are not able to do, however, is to describe their own rules of speaking. It has been demonstrated many times that when native speakers are asked to explain or to identify forms which they or others in their community use in a given speech situation, their responses do not necessarily coincide with observed speech behavior.
One of the enormous advantages of an ethnographic approach is that the hypotheses come out of the process of collecting and analyzing the data. After looking at a particular speech setting, event, or act and gathering as much data about it as possible, one looks to see what the patterns and rules of interaction are. Sometimes what is found is counterintuitive—if the researchers had had to identify the factors that condition the speech behavior before having actually studied the behavior, their native-speaker intuitions could easily have misled them.
A case in point occurs in my own recent work. Since 1974, I have been observing, recording, and analyzing the spontaneous forms and patterns of various speech acts and events in my own mainstream, middle-class, native English-speaking community. I

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND VALIDITY

693

have been interested in what can be learned about the forms of these chunks of discourse and, more important, what sorts of
insights can be gained about the underlying assumptions and values
of a given speech community and even about how people use their linguistic resources to negotiate within the social structure of which they are a part.
One very unexpected and very consistent finding has been that there is a qualitative difference between the speech behavior which middle-class Americans use to intimates, status-unequals, and strangers, on the one hand, and with nonintimates, status-equal friends, co-workers, and acquaintances, on the other. I call this my bulge theory because of the way the frequencies of certain types of speech behavior look on a chart.
For all of the speech acts I have studied so far, the pattern is very similar in this respect. In regard to frequency, elaboration, and negotiation, the two extremes show very similar patterns on the diagrams, as opposed to the middle section, which displays a characteristic bulge. When these behaviors are compared in terms of the social context, and especially in terms of the social relationships of the interlocutors, the two extremes of social distance—minimum and maximum—seem to call forth very similar behavior, while relationships which are more toward the center show marked differences. This is not something that I would have been able to hypothesize. From a native speaker’s point of view, the findings were counterintuitive.
What do these two groups at the extremes of social distance have in common? Why the bulge? It appears that social relationships at the two extremes—intimates, on the one hand, and status-unequals or strangers, on the other, share one very important factor: Those relationships are relatively certain. In other words, the more that status and social distance are seen as fixed, the easier it is for speakers to know what to expect of one another. Elaboration and negotiation are relatively unnecessary. In a complex urban society in which speakers may belong to a variety of nonoverlapping networks, the situations in which status and social distance are not fixed are those that require the most work, the most negotiation.
For example, although compliments are exchanged between intimates and between total strangers, the great majority (the bulge) occur in interactions between speakers who are neither but who, because they are of similar status to each other, may see one another as a potential friend. This is not to suggest that compliments do not occur between status-unequals. In fact, compliments on performance are often very important in the relationship of boss to employee or teacher to pupil (Wolfson, 1983). When the

694

TESOL QUARTERLY

compliment has to do with appearance, sex is the major variable, overriding status in virtually all cases. This in itself is an interesting finding, since it relates directly to the position of women in
American society and touches on sociocultural expectations of a
very different sort (Wolfson, 1984, in press). However, the great majority of all compliments, no matter what their topic, occur between status-equals who are potential friends.
The data on invitations are even more striking in this regard. The data collected from spontaneous interactions fell into two categories for this speech act (Wolfson, 1981; Wolfson, D’AmicoReisner, & Huber, 1983). The first consisted of unambiguous, complete invitations including time, place, activity, and a request for response. These unambiguous invitations occurred most frequently between intimates and between status-unequals—the two sets of interlocutors with whom speakers can be relatively sure of their standing.
The second category of invitations consisted of ambiguous or incomplete references to the possibility of future social commitments. Once a large body of data had been collected, these socalled invitations were recognized as “leads.” Utterances such as We really must get together sometime or Let’s have lunch together soon are typical examples. For a social commitment to result from a lead, both parties to the interaction nearly always had to take part in negotiating the arrangement. What was particularly interesting about these leads was that they occurred between status-equal nonintimates—that is, between speakers who recognized their relationships as open to redefinition.
The findings of work on partings done by Kipers (1984) and Williams (1984) provide additional evidence that speakers behave in markedly different ways with those who occupy fixed positions in their social world and those with whom their relationships are less settled. As Kipers put it,
Where there is no framework of social contact in place to assure casual friends and acquaintances that a future meeting will take place, partings reflect concern over the survival of the relationship. Mean number of turns in these partings was the highest of any group in this study. Individual utterances were notably longer too . . . the lengthy negotiations over future meeting time reassure both participants that even though they may not designate a definite time when they will see one another again, they both value the relationship enough to want it to continue. (p. 6)

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND VALIDITY

695

While all partings share certain basic features, analysis indicates that shared knowledge of social distance and mutual certainty of future meeting are the important conditioning factors. As Williams says,
Where one or another or both of these factors is [sic] shared by the participants, interactions will exhibit certain predictable characteristics. Pre-partings will be absent as will lengthy negotiations as to when the parties will meet again. Parting signals and “goodbye” and its variants will occur in only a minority of cases. Conversely, when knowledge of both social distance and time of future meeting are [sic] absent, partings diverge from this pattern. (p. 8)
My most recent work, on nonformulaic compliments and nonformulaic greetings, shows strong evidence of repeating the patterns so far found.
In her recent work on the speech act of refusals, Beebe (1985) has uncovered the very same pattern in operation. The least elaborated refusals were those to intimates or to status-unequals and strangers. The greatest amount of elaboration and negotiation, the greatest number of turns, and the most lengthy and complicated refusals were in the speech of nonintimate status-equals. To quote Beebe,
Strangers are brief. If they want to say no, they do so. Real intimates are also brief. It is friends and other acquaintances who are most likely to get involved in long negotiations with multiple repetitions, extensive elaborations, and a wide variety of semantic formulas. (p. 10)
Eisenstein and Bodman (1986), in their studies of expressions of
gratitude, are finding convergence along the same lines as well. On the basis of these and other examples of convergence, I
theorize that this elaboration of speech patterns among nonintimates is reflective of the dynamics of our social structure. If it were not for the great potential for social mobility in our society, there would be very little reason for people to negotiate in the way they do. We know from the anthropological literature that traditional societies contrast sharply with the bulge pattern just described. In more traditional societies, all relationships are much more fixed; people know where they stand with everyone. On the other hand, there is much less potential for social mobility. My findings on speech-act behavior may provide insight into the way speech reflects and perpetuates differences in social structure.
Many studies could be cited which purposely or inadvertently demonstrate that native-speaker intuitions include only the ability to judge accuracy and appropriateness and not the ability to describe or even to recall with any degree of reliability the actual patterns of behavior. Thus, if it is useful for us to know and describe

696

TESOL QUARTERLY

objectively the rules of speaking for any language, including our own, then we must learn what they are, not by examining our own intuitions or by depending entirely on the elicitation of intuitive responses from other native speakers, but by an iterative procedure which makes use of both elicitation and the investigation of actual
speech in use. This is not to suggest that techniques of data collection which
depend on elicitation should be avoided, but as researchers, we must be aware of the potential pitfalls. Most important, we need to recognize that elicited data draw on native-speaker perceptions and cannot be presumed to be the same as the speech which would actually be produced by a given set of speakers. Analysts who rely entirely on elicitation instruments run the serious risk of gathering data which may obscure important variables or which may even completely misinterpret interfactional patterns. No amount of statistical manipulation can compensate for the lack of basic information to be gained by rigorous qualitative study of speech in use. As Erickson (1977) puts it,
What “qualitative” researchers have to offer others is potentially valid insight into functionally relevant definitions of social facts. What “quantitative” researchers have to offer the “qualitatives” is ways of determining the generalizability of qualitative insights, ways of escaping from that tyranny of the single case. (p. 66)
For this reason, I am convinced that a two-pronged approach toward data collection and analysis is necessary. Because the design of an experiment or an elicitation instrument forces the researcher to decide in advance what variables will be tested and because native-speaker intuitions about the factors which condition speech behavior are so unreliable, it is safer to begin by systematic observation and to allow hypotheses to emerge from the data themselves. Then, an elicitation instrument can be developed which is sensitive to what has been found to occur in actuality, and the hypotheses which have emerged can be tested for generalizability and validity.
It seems reasonable, given all we know about the complexity of human speech behavior, that this moving back and forth between observation and elicitation or experiment will need to be repeated a number of times, always refining as we learn. The important point is that if we are to arrive at valid analyses of speech behavior, observation and elicitation will have to be used as necessary complements to one another.

Quantitative Methods in Language Acquisition Research
GRANT HENNING University of California, Los Angeles
This article attempts to clarify and define quantitative research as it is applied in the study of language acquisition. Trends in the use of quantitative and nonquantitative methods in applied linguistics are reported, and suggestions are made concerning useful paradigms and procedures for further research in language acquisition.
In recent years considerable concern has arisen over the misapplication or avoidance of appropriate quantitative methods in language acquisition research. Brown (1986) expressed concern that established conventions in quantitative research methodology were not consistently adhered to by quantitative researchers in applied linguistics. His primary data source was articles appearing in the major professional journals of applied linguistics, such as the TESOL Quarterly and Language Learning.
Similarly, Ediger, Lazaraton, and Riggenbach (1986) noted that there is a paucity of formal statistical preparation on the part of the majority of educators responsible for guiding graduate research in applied linguistics in general. Their survey of a large cross section of university graduate thesis and dissertation advisers in applied linguistics revealed that respondents had completed, on an average, fewer than two formal courses in research design or statistics and that the majority reported no formal preparation at all.
Henning (1985) reported on common problems in quantitative language acquisition research, including unreliability and invalidity of data-elicitation techniques, failure of experimental studies to state a formal hypothesis for testing, failure to report frequencies with percentages or standard deviations with means, and insufficient use of appropriate inferential statistics.
In light of these concerns, this article has three purposes: (a) to provide a definition of quantitative research, as opposed to qualitative or anecdotal research; (b) to report on trends in
701

published research in the major journals of applied linguistics, in general, and second language acquisition, in particular; and (c) to recommend promising quantitative research paradigms and associated statistical methods for the study of language acquisition.
At the outset it must be acknowledged that quantitative research is not the only way to study language acquisition, nor is it necessarily the best procedure in every instance. There are, however, certain profound advantages to the appropriate application of quantitative methodology. For example, quantitative methods allow us to go beyond the identification and linear description of language acquisition phenomena and to draw formal inferences from the data about expected frequencies of occurrence, to assess the likelihood that phenomena are generalizable beyond a given instance, or to compare adequacies of existing theories and models to account for the phenomena in question. Without some recourse to quantitative methods, some marriage of words and numbers, it is inconceivable that the investigation of language acquisition will ever be said to belong to the realm of scientific inquiry.

DEFINITIONS
What is quantitative research? For purposes of communication, quantitative research may be said to be the kind of research that involves the tallying, manipulation, or systematic aggregation of quantities of data. Quantitative research may involve the use of descriptive statistics such as means, percentages, standard deviations, and proportions; or it may require use of inferential statistics such as analysis of variance, Student’s t, analysis of covariance, and varieties of correlational statistics. Quantitative research may or may not involve formal hypothesis testing, as in a classical experimental design.
Since this definition is so broad and encompasses such a variety of research endeavors, it may be useful to consider what kinds of research might be labeled nonquantitative. Qualitative studies such as journal keeping, library research, anecdotal summaries, and certain kinds of discourse analysis fall into this category. Formulation of theoretical positions unaccompanied by aggregated data, as well as metaresearch studies that report on the findings of a group of studies without attempting to tally results or make quantitative generalizations, might also qualify. Any attempt to cite authorities or report observations, introspections, or descriptions of language or its use without in some sense quantifying the results would belong here. Also, in some cases, critiques or rebuttals

regarding studies conducted, positions held, or methods employed may be termed nonquantitative research. It should be obvious that there is room for both qualitative and quantitative research in fields of language acquisition.
TRENDS
Nevertheless, there appears to be a distinct trend toward the quantitative in language acquisition research. Not only are more quantitative studies being published in applied linguistics journals today than was the case 5, 10, or 15 years ago, but there is also a distinct trend toward greater use of inferential as opposed to mere descriptive statistics.
Consider the information reported in Tables 1 and 2. Articles published in the TESOL Quarterly and Language Learning were analyzed and tabulated for 5-year intervals beginning with 1970. An initial decision was made concerning whether an article was quantitative or nonquantitative, according to the criteria discussed above. Then, for all quantitative studies, a closer look was taken to determine whether the studies had an experimental or nonexperimental design, tested a hypothesis or did not, employed inferential or descriptive statistics, and used multivariate or bivariate statistics.
Experimental studies, irrespective of author’s claims, were considered to be those with a classical experimental design involving random assignment to a treatment and/or a control condition. Hypothesis testing was considered to have occurred when an explicit hypothesis was stated and tested. Inferential statistics were those used for probabilistic generalization from a sample to some population of interest. Multivariate statistics referred to those sophisticated statistical techniques involving the use of multiple dependent variables, such as MANOVA and factor analysis, or multiple-combined independent variables, such as multiple correlation and regression techniques.
Note in Table 1, which presents statistics for the T E S O L Quarterly, the increase in the percentage of quantitative versus qualitative articles published from 1970 (12% versus 88%) to 1985 (61% versus 39%). While the amount of experimental research increased over the same period, it appears to have declined as a proportion of all quantitative research. Formal hypothesis testing shows no appreciable gain. The use of inferential statistics appears to have increased in relation to mere descriptive statistics, and there is a slight tendency for multivariate statistics to appear in place of bivariate or univariate statistics.

The picture is similar, although the gains appear more dramatic, in Table 2. Note that in this example quantitative research has increased from 24% to 92% of the total of all published research. The two nonquantitative articles appearing in 1985 were rebuttals to critiques of quantitative research. If they are excluded, the percentage of quantitative research becomes 100%. This researcher views this as a positive development—a kind of coming of age of a discipline.

Note that while hypothesis testing has increased, it has declined as a proportion of all quantitative research. This is puzzling in view of the fact that more inferential statistics are being employed. The explanation indicates one of the most prevalent deficiencies of quantitative research in applied linguistics. Many researchers adopt a hypothesis-testing mode without ever formally stating the hypothesis. It is not enough in this instance to provide research questions or purposes; the experimental design calls for an explicit hypothesis. Beyond this it is desirable to state a null hypothesis and possible alternative hypotheses. Furthermore, it is best to state in advance a level of confidence at which the null hypothesis may be rejected. No one is forcing us to test hypotheses, but if that is what we claim to be doing, let us do it in the appropriate manner.
The second most common flaw, in my opinion, is the tendency for quantitative research studies in applied linguistics to be labeled experiments when they are not. Many of these studies do not describe sample-selection procedures nor assign subjects to treatments randomly; thus, they are not replicable. Moreover, parametric inferential statistics, while commonly used, are usually inappropriate, since they normally require random assignment of subjects to treatments or treatments to subjects.
While considering common defects of language acquisition research or applied linguistics research in general, let us also reflect on the fact that the majority of these studies which involved measurement of linguistics phenomena made no effort to provide some estimate of the reliability or validity of the instrumentation and procedures used to elicit data. This is a serious problem.
It is not at all discouraging that multivariate statistics do not yet dominate the field, since much of the research in language acquisition must necessarily use small samples. There are some procedures, however, that can help us with quantitative research in the field of language acquisition when small samples are involved.
SUGGESTED RESEARCH PARADIGMS
1. In correlational studies in which randomization is not possible and it is not known whether there was a normal distribution in the population from which the sample was drawn, it is usually appropriate to use a nonparametric statistic such as Spearman’s Rho. Thus, it is quite acceptable to report rank correlations to

compare orders of morpheme acquisition. Several of the studies surveyed for inclusion in Tables 1 and 2 did this.
2. Although none was encountered, studies seeking to test hypotheses in a true experimental design might take advantage of single-subject-per-cell ANOVA designs, such as the Latin Square design. There was an attempt to use repeated measures of ANOVA, which is also an appropriate experimental method to overcome the disadvantages of a small sample.
3. Chi-square methodology was used appropriately by several researchers seeking to test independence or goodness of fit with small samples. Chi-square is a particularly appropriate test of fit to the predictions of linguistic models when the sample is small (i.e., as few as 5 persons or observations per cell) and when the data consist of frequency tabulations of categorical data, rather than test scores.
4. In addition to chi-square, path-analytic methods should also help the language acquisition researcher to test competing theories. Unfortunately, however, path analysis usually calls for larger samples than does chi-square. But since several of the studies investigated relied on multiple correlation and regression and since path analysis is derived from those procedures, it seems likely that its use could be greatly expanded in language acquisition research.
5. In the articles reviewed, there was one example of the use of a latent trait model to investigate parameters of reading. Since these models involve the construction of probabilistic latent continua, it seems that their potential for investigating language acquisition onset phenomena has hardly begun to be explored (see Henning, 1984).
6. It was encouraging to see that only one article employed multiple t tests when factorial ANOVA would have been more appropriate. Since many researchers made appropriate use of factorial ANOVA designs, there may be situations in which discriminant analysis could also be applied as an appropriate research paradigm. This would be the case, for example, when the researcher wished to determine which of an array of linguistic phenomena elicited were most effective in differentiating between two or more groups of individuals.
7. Factor-analytic techniques were employed—not always appropriately. When the sample is large enough (usually in the hundreds), this can be an effective technique for aggregating data into mutually exclusive or correlated variables called factors. Use of confirmatory rather than exploratory methods of factor analysis can allow the researcher to test hypotheses and to

construct causal models which can enhance our knowledge of theoretical frameworks of language use.
8. This section would not be complete without reference to appropriate means of data elicitation in the study of language acquisition. There is an understandable desire on the part of researchers to elicit language phenomena in authentic contexts. If, however, the linguistic feature of interest is uncommon, it is unlikely that attaching a tape recorder to a subject and turning him or her loose is going to be a successful means of elicitation. Therefore, it is often necessary to construct contexts in which language phenomena are obligatory. To do this, it may be necessary to rely on structured interviews and paper-and-pencil tests. Repeated elicitation in a variety of contexts are usually necessary to ensure reliability of measurement. Validity of measurement must also be considered, but validity as a measurement construct cannot exist apart from the preexistence of reliable measurement. Establishment of content validity may require reference to a panel of subject-matter experts. Establishment of construct validity may require the elicitation of similar data using a variety of methods, as in multitrait/multimethod validation. Criterion-related validity estimation will require correlation with acceptable referent dataelicitation results.
9. Finally, the teacher/researcher will need reference material to serve as a guide in conducting quantitative research. Several important resources span a broad cross section of experimental and quasi-experimental methods, including but not limited to multivariate techniques and nonparametric methods. These include Tuckman (1978), Campbell and Stanley (1963), Ferguson (1981), Guilford and Fruchter (1973), Magnusson (1967), Kirk (1968), Hambleton and Swaminathan (1985), Hatch and Farhady (1982), Henning (in press), Namboodiri, Carter, and Blalock (1975), and Kerlinger and Pedhazur (1973).
