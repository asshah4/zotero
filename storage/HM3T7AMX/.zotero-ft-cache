Abstract 
Among the most obnoxious stimuli that the population at large is exposed to during everyday life are odorous emissions from sewage treatment plants. Such emissions are complex and contain many different types of odorants that vary in quantity depending upon the contents and efficiency of treatment processes. Because little is known about how individual odorants in complex mixtures affect the perception of each other, it is difficult to develop mathematical models that can predict the pleasantness, strength, and quality characteristics of an emission at different distances from a source. In the present study, the interactions of the four major types of odorants emitted by treatment plants worldwide, namely, hydrogen sulphide, isovaleric acid, butanethiol, and skatole, were investigated by measuring the perceived intensity of individual odorants alone and in mixtures, and the overall perceived intensity, unpleasantness, and qualities of mixtures. In addition, models for predicting odor strength were investigated. The results indicated that (i) the perceived odor intensity (odor strength) of mixtures of the odorants was equal or greater than that of any of the individual constituents, but less than the sum of their intensities. However, as the number of components in a mixture increased, the intensity of the most dominant component provided a good approximation of the intensity of the mixture. (ii) The vector model of intensity summation also satisfactorily predicted the odor intensity of mixtures containing two, three, or four of the odorants investigated. (iii) In no instance was the intensity of one odorant enhanced by another, i.e., no synergistic interactions occurred; the greater the number of odorants in a mixture, the greater was the degree of suppression of the individual constituents. (iv) The greater the number of constituents in a mixture the more difficult it became to identify individual constituents. (v) Hydrogen sulphide was the least frequently suppressed constituent, and isovaleric acid and skatole were the most frequently suppressed constituents in mixtures. (vi) The unpleasantness of mixtures was usually greater than that of the individual constituents, indicating that models used for predicting complaint levels in communities affected by sewage odor and based on assumptions related to a single odorant, e.g., hydrogen sulphide, will underestimate the number of complaints. Even mixtures with low but above threshold concentrations of these odorants are likely to generate complaints.

Abstract 
The perceived intensity and quality of binary mixtures consisting of the common but dissimilar odorants, benzaldehyde (almond), eugenol (cloves), propionic acid (vinegar) and (−)-carvone (spearmint), were determined over a wide range of environmentally relevant concentrations. Consistent data were obtained from each of the odor pairs. This showed that the intensity of odorants not their quality determined the contribution of each to the quality of a mixture. Except for the pair carvone-propionic acid, both odorants were perceived only when the difference between their intensities was small. The results confirmed an earlier finding [13] that the total intensity of a mixture is less than the sum of the intensities of the two components, and also showed that it is never less than the intensity of the weaker component. Seven major characteristics of binary odor mixtures are defined.

Abstract 
Rarely do we encounter a single odorant in our environment. Perception of odours, therefore, usually depends on the reception and neural processing of many components. However, little is known about how and where odour mixtures are processed. Evidence is presented here that suppression of one odour by another, a common result of mixing odours, is primarily a peripheral event. Having demonstrated with human subjects that perception of one or both odorants in two-component mixtures is dependent on the polarity and perceived intensity of the odorants, the same mixtures were presented to rats that had been injected with a metabolic marker, [ 3 H]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). By measuring the metabolic activity in the glomeruli of the rat olfactory bulb, where the axons of the receptor cells terminate, it was found that in a mixture where humans had perceived only one odour, there is a dramatic reduction in metabolic activity of glomeruli specific to the suppressed odour. In mixtures where both odorants were perceived, metabolic activity characteristic of both components was observed. These findings indicate that similar mechanisms underlie the perception of odour mixtures in the two species. Since metabolic activity revealed by 2-DG in glomeruli occurs predominantly in presynaptic receptor axons 2 , the reduced activity seen after stimulation with odour mixtures indicates that a mechanism for mixture suppression begins at the receptor cells. Therefore, the ability of one odorant to suppress another in a mixture is probably determined by their relative chemical polarities, which effects access to and competition for membrane receptor sites in the olfactory epithelium.

Abstract 
The neural mechanisms underlying the perception of complex odor mixtures are largely unknown. The present study investigated the hypothesis that odorants in a mixture are processed and perceived in series. The results indicate that (i) odorants in mixtures are temporally processed with up to several hundred milliseconds separating individual components; (ii) ‘fast’ odorants are more likely to be a suppressor of ‘slow’ odorants than the reverse; and (iii) separation times can be altered by changing the concentrations of mixture components. These findings provide a new mechanism to account for the limited ability of humans to identify odorants in mixtures and for odor suppression.
