Abstract 
The microtubule motor protein cytoplasmic dynein and its activator dynactin are essential in higher eukaryotes, due to critical roles in vesicular transport and cell division. Neurons are uniquely sensitive to defects in dynein/dynactin function, which affect retrograde axonal transport, neurotrophic factor signaling, neurofilament transport, mRNA localization, neuronal migration, and protein recycling and degradation. Mutations in either dynein or dynactin lead to motor neuron degeneration and loss. Recent progress in understanding the cellular mechanisms of dynein/dynactin function, and the effects of dynein/dynactin dysfunction has provided new insight into the roles of microtubule-based motility in the neuron.

Abstract 
The importance of active axonal transport to the neuron has been highlighted by the recent discoveries that mutations in microtubule motor proteins result in neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations affecting microtubule motor function have been shown to cause hereditary forms of Charcot–Marie-Tooth disease (type 2A), hereditary spastic paraplegia and motor neuron disease. Although motor neurons appear to be uniquely susceptible to defects in axonal transport, recent work has identified links between perturbations in axonal transport and the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. More broadly, cytoskeletal abnormalities might also be at the root of related disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy, supporting a key role for axonal transport in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract 
Summary 
A key milestone in the study of neuronal transport occurred about 20 years ago with the identification of the axoplasmic motors kinesin and dynein that generate movement along microtubules in opposite directions (Brady 1985; Vale, Schnapp et al. 1985; Vale, Reese et al. 1985; Paschal and Vallee 1987). Conventional kinesin (kinesin I) was identified as a novel force-generating protein that moves toward the plus end of the microtubule. Cytoplasmic dynein, an isoform of the flagellar motor first purified as a force generating ATPase 40 years ago (Gibbons 1966), was identified as the motor protein for retrograde axonal transport. Since then, the function, structure, mechanism, and cargo interactions of these motor proteins have been studied in detail, providing new insights into axonal transport. These studies also tell us that there is much still to investigate and that many questions still remain unanswered.

Abstract 
Active transport along the axon is crucial to the neuron. Motor-driven transport supplies the distal synapse with newly synthesized proteins and lipids, and clears damaged or misfolded proteins. Microtubu
