The grey whale, Eschrichtius robustus (fig 1), is a
fascinating animal that lives for 30-40 years. The numbers of grey whales have increased since the ban on
killing them and there are now about 20000 in
existence. They stay in the Bering Sea in May and June
and then migrate to the lagoons on the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico. The'yTslhes eeey pewwp iithh tthheeiir hheeaaddss' and tails down, holding their blow holes above water (fig 2). Mating occurs in the shallow waters and strong,

tidal currents of the lagoons. The cooperativeness of grey whales is most obvious in the way that they
overcome the difficulty of achieving coitus face to face
in water. The female is supported and kept steady by
another male-an unusual extension of a best man's 4duties.
~~~~~~~Grey whales are not afraid of people and actively
seek out ships in the lagoons, thus allowing observers
a close view and even the occasional touch (fig 3).
In February 1989 an expedition to Baja California
was organised to record the electrocardiogram of the grey whale. The group included Dutch, American,
and Mexican scientists; His Royal Highness Prince
Bernhard of The Netherlands, who is chairman of the Whale EGG Foundation; Mr N F Halbertsma,
director of the World Wide Fund for Nature in
The Netherlands; Mr T M T M Kasteel, the Dutch
ambassador in Mexico; and two professional photographers from San Diego. Prince Bernhard and Mr Halbertsma, both superb photographers, planned to
make a cinefilm of the expedition and the area we
<tB ~~~~~~~~~visited. We chartered a boat, the Spirit of Adventure, from
San Diego and, with a captain and crew of seven, we set
sail on the night of 8 February. After a trip lasting 20 hours in rough seas and strong winds we reached Scammon's Bay (Laguna Ojo de Liebre), about 800 km south of San Diego (fig 4). There were plenty of whales but no friendly ones and so we continued 200 km
further south to Laguna San Ignacio, where we hoped that the whales would be more friendly.
In 1956 White et al tried to record the electrocardiogram of a grey whale in Scammon's lagoon.2 They used harpoon electrodes that were the size of arrows and
shot them into the whale from a flimsy wooden skiff.
Not only did his attempt fail but it was hazardous. We
decided to make use of the friendly behaviour of the grey whale. This was crucial to the success of our expedition because we wanted to apply to the whale a large suction electrode that had a small telemetric
device attached to it or, if this failed, a small needle with a lead wire, and both needed to be attached by hand. Neither was harmful to the whale.

Why did we want to record the electrocardiogram of a large whale?

non-linearity of the relation in extremely small and

There is a close and linear relation between mammalian body weight and heart weight,6 heart weight being about 0-6% of body weight.7 Given that the conduction velocity in all mnammals is probably about the same from morphological characteristics09 and assuming that the atrioventricular co'nduction time (PR interval on the surface electrocardiogram) is a function of conduction distance, the conduction time should increase with the size of the heart and thus with the length of the atrioventricular conduction system.

extremely large hearts, however, indicates that mechanisms other than straightforward "nerve" conduction might operate in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. '0 ' By extrapolating data from the PR interval in horses, smaller whales, and elephants, we deduced that the PR interval in large whales would not exceed 500-600 ms. We therefore embarked on our expedition to confirm or refute our deductions.
In addition, we wanted to find out more about the hearts of large marine mammals because our knowledge to date came from inferences based on

comparative studies in smaller animals. Large hearts,

ho.wever, have a greater tendency to fibrillate.'2 The

Purkinje system in the ventricles of large hearts

promotes electrical homogeneity and thus helps to

prevent ventricular fibrillation, but there is no

Purkinje system in the atria. Is this why atrial fibrilla-

tion is common in horses?'3 And what about whales?

Could cardiac arrhythmias be a cause for the beaching

of whales? To protect these mammals we need to study

them more thoroughly.

Results
We stayed at Laguna San Ignacio from 11-15 February, a time when grey whales usually come close to the boats.' We were, however, unlucky with the weather. The cold front which in September 1988 had trapped three grey whales in the ice off the coast of Alaska had reached Baja California by the time we were there and so there was more wind than usual
and water and air temperatures were below normal. According to our marine biologist, Dr Theodore J Walker, this was why the whales were less cooperative than usual. We could therefore not apply the suction devices and were able only to apply a needle electrode once for just five minutes. Figure 6 shows a QRS complex obtained by signal averaging of several QRS complexes. We estimated that the whale weighed 20000 kg, which suggests a heart weight of between 100 and 120 kg. The QRS voltage recorded was only 0 1 mV because the electrocardiogram was recorded in salt water with a unipolar lead and because the,

electrode was some distance away from the heart, with a thick layer of blubber separating the two. The QRS complex lasted about 200 ms, which is a short time for a heart of this size, and therefore the ventricular myocardium of the whale must contain a dense Purkinje network. The record did not allow us to draw conclusions about the characteristics of the P wave so we could not answer the question, "What is the PR interval in a heart that is considerably larger than that ofan elephant?" The duration of the QRS complex does indicate, however, that the atrioventricular conduction time must be short. We found a heart rate of about 20 beats/min, which may well decrease during diving.

Final remarks
Our expedition was only partly successful. We did obtain an electrocardiogram, but our short stay in the Lagoon and the unfavourable weather prevented us from using the suction electrodes and the telemetric devices attached to them. We did not record enough cardiac cycles to show a P wave, and therefore we still do not know the atrioventricular transmission time in the largest heart. The lessons we learnt will be useful in achieving success next time and the difficulties we encountered have made us realise that collecting reliable biological data in large animals is a tedious task. 1'
