ABSTRACT Infective endocarditis (IE) is among the most severe infectious disease, the prevention of which has not decreased its incidence. The age of patients and the rate of health care-associated IE have increased as a consequence of medical progress. The prevention strategies have been subjected to an important debate and nonspeciﬁc hygiene measures are now placed above the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Indeed, the level of evidence of antibiotic prophylaxis efﬁciency is low and the indications of its prescription have been restricted in the recent international guidelines. In cases carrying a high suspicion of IE, efforts should be made to rapidly identify patients with a deﬁnite or highly probable diagnosis of IE and to ﬁnd the causative pathogen to ensure that appropriate treatment, including urgent valvular surgery, begins promptly. Although echocardiography remains the main accurate imaging modality to identify endocardial lesions associated with IE, it can be negative or inconclusive especially in cases of prosthetic valve or

Endocarditis is deﬁned as an inﬂammation of the endocardial surface of the heart. This might include heart valves, mural endocardium, or the endocardium that covers implanted material such as prosthetic valves, pacemaker/deﬁbrillator leads, and catheters. In most cases, the inﬂammation is related to a bacterial or fungal infection. Streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci are the most frequent causative pathogens, and rarely endocarditis also can be related to noninfective causes such as immunological or neoplastic.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious disease with an incidence of 30-100 episodes per million patient-years, which did not decreased despite different prevention strategies.1-5 Its mortality rate remains high despite diagnostic and therapeutic improvements because more than one-third of patients will die within the ﬁrst year of diagnosis.6,7 Important changes in the epidemiological proﬁle of this disease that have occurred over the past few decades can explain a part of this situation. Indeed, the age of patients and the rate of health careassociated IE have increased as a consequence of medical progress.8-10 The decrease in rheumatic heart disease and the increase in degenerative valve heart diseases have led to an increase in patients’ age and frequency of comorbidities. Moreover, the use of prosthetic valves and implantable pacemakers/deﬁbrillators among patients has increased steadily and nosocomial IE secondary to intravenous line infections. Thus, the more frequent causative agents now tend to be aggressive pathogens such as staphylococci, resistant-enterococci, or

other intracardiac devices. Recent studies demonstrated the diagnostic value of other imaging strategies including cardiac computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/CT, radiolabelled leukocyte single-photon emission CT/CT, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Novel perspectives on the management of endocarditis are emerging and offer a hope for decreasing the rate of residual deaths by accelerating the processes of diagnosis, risk stratiﬁcation, and instauration of antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, the rapid transfer of high-risk patients to specialized mediosurgical centres (IE team), the development of new surgical modalities, and close longterm follow-up are of crucial importance.

fungi. Although substantial geographical variations exist, a substantial increase in the rate of staphylococcal IE has been reported, especially in the United States, where chronic hemodialysis, diabetes, and intravascular devices are the 3 main factors associated with IE due to Staphylococcus aureus.9
Therefore, efforts should be made to develop new strategies at each step of IE management to reduce the residual causes of IE-related deaths. Challenges in IE management include: (1) cost-effective measures of prevention; (2) improvement of diagnostic strategies to reduce the delays for the initiation of the appropriate treatment; and (3) better identiﬁcation of patients who require close monitoring and urgent surgery.7
In this article we review the current knowledge and recommendations in prevention, diagnosis, and management of IE. Perspectives and future directions are also discussed.
Prevention
Existing evidence
The prophylaxis of IE aims at prevention of development of bacteria on endocardial lesions of patients with previously diagnosed cardiac predispositions. It is based on screening and treatment of potential entry sites for organisms, but also sometimes on antibiotic prophylaxis given before health care procedures at risk for bacteremia. In common practice, dental care procedures are the most common situations for which antibiotic prophylaxis has been recommended, but some gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract procedures have also been involved.11 Those health care procedures carry various rates of induced bacteremia, from 5% for a simple colonoscopy, to 88% for periodontal surgeries.11 Predisposing cardiac conditions (PCC) have also been stratiﬁed depending on the risk of development of endocarditis, but this stratiﬁcation has changed over time with corresponding recommendations for prophylaxis.12,13
Surprisingly, there is no strong evidence supporting the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with PCC. The widely adopted recommendations are mainly based on the results of experimental studies in animals; these works have shown the efﬁciency of different antibiotic regimens in preventing endocarditis after intravenous inoculation of bacteria in rats, carrying experimentally-induced endocardial lesions.14,15 Therefore, these experimental models used transient highgrade bacteremia to reproduce the potential effects of a

dental care procedure. However, everyday-life actions like chewing or tooth brushing have been shown to cause frequent low-grade bacteremia,16,17 and might be responsible for a much greater cumulative risk than occasional heath care procedures. Roberts estimated that the cumulative everyday bacteremia over 1 year was 6 million times higher than bacteremia from a dental extraction.18 Moreover, a recent experimental study conﬁrmed that high-grade bacteremia is not mandatory to induce endocarditis, and supported the hypothesis that everyday exposure to low-grade transient bacteremia represents a greater risk.19
As underlined by the recent review from the Cochrane Collaboration concerning antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry,20 there are no randomized controlled trials nor cohort studies on this topic. Of the few existing case-control studies, the Cochrane Oral Health Group could include only 1 case-control study in their review, with no signiﬁcant protective effect of prophylaxis against endocarditis.21 The few other available case-control studies did not bring contributive results either, and were not included in the Cochrane review because of biases.22-24 Furthermore, in large observational studies reviewing cases of endocarditis that have developed on known PCC, only a minority of cases are secondary to medical procedures.25
Therefore, there is no strong evidence in humans supporting antibiotic prophylaxis against IE, and it is not very likely that some new data will be provided in the near future. Indeed, because of the low incidence of this disease, a randomized controlled trial would need the enrollment of a huge number of patients, and it would probably be fraught with legal and ethical issues.
The eventual beneﬁt of antibiotic prophylaxis must also be balanced with the potential adverse effects of such antibiotics. Indeed, all types of hypersensitivity have been reported with
the use of b-lactam, including anaphylaxis. However, in a
case-control study, the International Collaborative Study of Severe Anaphylaxis found a low incidence of anaphylaxis after oral amoxicillin, at 6 cases per 10,000.26 Noteworthy, only 1 case of fatal anaphylaxis related to oral amoxicillin has been reported over 35 years in a recent British survey.27 Furthermore, the extensive use of such antibiotics is responsible for the development of resistant bacteria. However, the implication of single doses of antibiotics in the selection of resistant micro-organisms is uncertain. Finally, there is a theoretical risk of Clostridium difﬁcile colitis after antibiotic prophylaxis.28

Recommendations from learned societies
Antibiotic prophylaxis of IE for patients with PCC has been recommended since 1955, with the ﬁrst guidelines published by the American Heart Association. Since this seminal paper, recurrent updates have been published by several learned societies from various countries. During the past decade, a dramatic change in antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines has occurred, with a major trend to restrict their indications. This trend started with the 2002 French recommendations,29 and reached its climax with the publication of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance in 2008, which basically did not recommend antibiotic prophylaxis, regardless of the dental, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal procedure, and whatever the PCC.30 Although the same trend can be noticed in most societies’ recommendations, guidelines remain much different between countries. However, the guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology13 and those from the American Heart Association12 are similar and still recommend antibiotic prophylaxis only in high-risk patients before a dental procedure (Table 1). American Heart Association guidelines justify this attitude by the fact that patients with a high-risk to develop IE are also those with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE.
Despite these restrictions, several studies showed that the incidence of IE has not increased since the changing of guidelines for IE prophylaxis.31-33
Our recommendations
Despite the low level of evidence supporting the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for IE in patients at risk, malpractice claims are not uncommon from patients who develop endocarditis after dental care for which they did not receive prophylaxis. In a study reviewing 319 cases of legal proceedings from different countries, 83 patients (26%) were successful in legally associating their dental procedure to the onset of IE.34 However, the most recent guidelines about antibiotic prophylaxis for IE in patients with PCC are disparate between the different learned societies. Therefore, our advice for clinicians would be to follow the current guidelines from the country where they have their practice, mainly to avoid medicolegal issues.
Although data supporting the current recommendations are poor, and the beneﬁts of prophylaxis hypothetic, the education of patients at risk of endocarditis seems to be

Canadian Journal of Cardiology Volume 30 2014
crucial,35 and general preventive measures must be highlighted. Indeed, early identiﬁcation and treatment of potential sources of endocarditis are mandatory: patients with PCC should be urged to consult their physicians in case of fever occurring at 48 hours or later or other lasting symptom, whereas physicians must be aware of the importance of blood cultures before any antibiotic prescription in this setting. Because of the suspected major role of everyday cumulative bacteremia in IE,16,17,19 the need for good oral hygiene and a frequent dental assessment is critical. Finally, the absolute necessity to limit invasive procedures in patients at risk must be highlighted. Indeed, the use of an intravenous catheter should be dramatically restricted in frequency and duration in patients carrying intracardiac devices, to reduce nosocomial bacteremia and therefore health care-induced IE.9
Diagnosis
Evolution of diagnostic strategies
In cases carrying a high suspicion of IE, appropriate antibiotics must be started as soon as possible because delay has negative effects on clinical outcomes. Efforts should be made to rapidly identify patients with a deﬁnite or highly probable diagnosis of IE and to ﬁnd the causative pathogen to ensure that appropriate antibiotic therapy begins promptly.
Diagnosis of IE usually relies on the association between an infectious syndrome and recent endocardial involvement. This is the cornerstone of the various classiﬁcations and scores proposed to facilitate the difﬁcult diagnosis of this disease. These classiﬁcations have been modiﬁed with advances in microbiological testing and cardiac imaging techniques. Thus, von Reyn and colleagues only used results from blood cultures to deﬁne the bacterial infection and the presence of a new regurgitant murmur or a predisposing heart disease to deﬁne endocardial involvement.36 The subsequent Duke University criteria included echocardiographic detection of the typical endocardial lesions (vegetation, abscess, new prosthetic dehiscence) as a major diagnostic criterion.37 In 2002, these criteria were further modiﬁed to include Coxiella burnetii serology as a new major criterion.38 The sensitivity of these modiﬁed Duke criteria is however limited, especially at an early stage of the disease, in cases of negative blood culture and in the presence of prosthetic valve or pacemaker/deﬁbrillator leads. New diagnostic strategies are thus emerging to improve pathogen identiﬁcation when blood cultures are negative, and to demonstrate endocardial involvement or vascular complications when echocardiography is negative or doubtful. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, immunohistochemistry, systematic serologies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and molecular imaging are promising tools that might be integrated into future diagnostic classiﬁcations (Fig. 1).
Clinical presentation
Although the presence of fever in a patient with a cardiac predisposition (heart valve disease, intracardiac materials, congenital heart disease) is the most frequent circumstance leading to diagnosis (almost 50% of cases39), clinical histories are highly variable (Table 2). Therefore, a high index of

suspicion and low threshold for investigation are essential. Blood cultures and echocardiography association still remain the cornerstones for diagnosis.13
Microbiological investigations
The challenges are to rapidly identify the causative pathogen and the rare cases of non-IE. In IE, blood cultures are negative in 2.5%-31% of cases.40,41 This often poses diagnostic and therapeutic issues. Although culture-negative endocarditis is often related to previous antibiotic therapy, a substantial number of cases result from infection with obligate intracellular bacteria, fungi, and fastidious pathogens.41 Isolation of these organisms requires culture on specialized media, and their growth is often slow. Second, appropriate antibiotic treatment is often delayed in cases in which endocarditis is caused by one of these pathogens, potentially affecting outcomes.
To resolve these issues, some authors proposed to standardise the timing and type of laboratory tests. This improves yields by systematically screening for all potential causes of IE.40 The “diagnostic kit,” composed of 3 units, can be done within 2 hours for every patient with suspected IE. The ﬁrst, performed immediately, includes a set of 2 blood culture bottles for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, and a tube to collect a serum sample which is used for detection of rheumatoid factor and estimation of speciﬁc antibodies directed against Coxiella burnetii, Legionella pneumophila, Bartonella, Brucella, Mycoplasma, and Aspergillus spp. The second and third units each contain a set of 2 blood culture bottles, both to be used 2 hours after the ﬁrst. The results of these diagnostic tests can be obtained soon after admission, thus shortening the time to institution of a speciﬁc therapy. Using this approach, clinicians would not have to defer serological testing until blood cultures are shown to be negative. However, the interest in immediate serological performance in low-prevalence areas must be identiﬁed, and we do not know whether this strategy is cost-effective. The diagnostic yield of repeated sampling thereafter is low.40
Causative pathogens can also be identiﬁed by other means, such as cultures from valve tissue. However, pathogen detection often poses a challenge for pathologists. It can be done using nonspeciﬁc histochemical stains or immunohistochemical analyses. Because speciﬁc antibodies are often not available,

another method, termed autoimmunohistochemistry, which uses the patient’s own serum, has been described for detection of microorganisms in valve specimens.42 This procedure uses a peroxidase-based method with the patient’s own serum as the source of antibodies directed against the etiologic microorganism of IE such as C. burnetti or Bartonella spp.
The rapid and reliable detection of pathogens using PCR has been validated in valve tissue from patients undergoing surgery for IE. Molecular pathogen detection in blood using pathogen-speciﬁc or broad-range PCR assays for bacteria and fungi is also promising. However, cautious interpretation of this molecular method is crucial, because of the risk of interfering contamination (false positive results). The clinical context must also be considered. These advanced methods can be integrated into a standardized multimodal strategy that allows better identiﬁcation of the causes of blood culturenegative endocarditis.41
Imaging investigations
Echocardiography. This remains an accurate method to detect endocardial involvement in IE and must be done rapidly and repeated weekly as soon as the condition is suspected. Data do not substantiate more than 3 echocardiography examinations as an efﬁcient strategy to increase the diagnostic yield for all but selected patients with suspected IE.43 Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be used initially as a normal scan in low-risk patients and provides a rapid, noninvasive conﬁrmation that the diagnosis is unlikely. TTE is superior to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for hemodynamic assessment of valvular dysfunction and probably for detecting anterior cardiac abscesses. Because of its greater sensitivity and speciﬁcity, TEE is recommended in all cases of: (1i) a negative TTE associated with high clinical suspicion; (2) poor TTE quality; (3) the presence of prosthetic valves or intracardiac device; and (4) a positive TTE.13 As recommended in the European guidelines,44 we believe that

TEE should be performed even in patients with positive TTE because it offers a better evaluation of the lesions; especially TEE could detect a small abscess when a TTE had only diagnosed vegetation. So, in these cases, performing TEE could have an effect on therapeutic management.
Although some guidelines state that TEE is not mandatory in isolated right-sided native valve IE with good quality TTE examination and unequivocal echocardiographic ﬁndings, we believe that TEE should be performed at least once to rule out an association with a complicated left-sided IE (perforation, ﬁstula, pseudoaneurysm, or abscess).
Follow-up echocardiography to monitor complications and response to treatment is mandatory. According to the European guidelines, repeat TTE and TEE should be considered during follow-up of uncomplicated IE to detect new silent complications and monitor vegetation size. However, the timing and mode (TTE or TEE) of repeat examination depend on the initial ﬁndings, type of micro-organism, and initial response to therapy. We believe that systematic use of TEE in this monitoring should be performed in the ﬁrst 2 weeks of treatment because most complications occur during this period although it is not based on strong evidence.
The identiﬁcation of vegetation, abscess, valvular perforation, or new prosthetic-valve dehiscence will enable conﬁrmation of the diagnosis in most, though not all, cases. Diagnosis might be particularly challenging in patients with intracardiac devices, a valvular prosthesis, pre-existing severe lesions, or with very small or no vegetation.
The systematic use of TTE alone vs TTE with TEE in all cases with S. aureus bacteremia remains an area of controversy. Although some experts recommend TEE in all patients presenting with S. aureus bacteremia, it is believed that the use of TEE could be guided by individual patient risk factors, mode of acquisition of S. aureus bacteremia, and clinical presentation. It should be limited to subsets with clinical ﬁndings of endocarditis, persistence, intracardiac devices, secondary foci, and relapse. The cost-effectiveness of TTE before TEE among these patients is unknown.45,46
The sensitivity of TTE for the diagnosis of vegetation is approximately 75%, but it might be reduced in cases of low echogenicity, very small vegetation, and in IE affecting

intracardiac devices or prostheses. TEE enhances the sensitivity to approximately 85%-90% for the diagnosis of vegetation, and > 90% speciﬁcity has been reported for TTE with TEE. The sensitivity of TTE for the diagnosis of abscesses is approximately 50%, compared with 90% for TEE. Speciﬁcity > 90% has been reported, for both TTE and for TEE.30,44
An erroneous diagnosis of IE might occur in several situations; for example, differentiating between vegetation and thrombi, prolapsed cusp, cardiac tumours (myxoma or ﬁbroelastoma), myxomatous changes, Lambl excrescences, or strands. Innovations in imaging techniques are emerging to resolve these issues, (eg, multislice computed tomography [CT], molecular imaging, and MRI).7 All of these techniques are complementary to echocardiography and do not replace it.
Multislice CT. Recent advances in the temporal and spatial resolution of multislice CT scanners allow high-resolution cardiac imaging. Currently, the major application of multislice CT is in the evaluation of coronary artery disease but it has been used also for heart valve disease, such as aortic stenosis and, more recently, in IE (Fig. 2).47-49
In a small study of 37 consecutive patients with clinically suspected IE, Feuchtner et al. found good results in detecting IE valvular and perivalvular damage using electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated 64-slice CT or dual-source CT. The diagnostic performance of CT for the detection of evident abnormalities for IE compared with TEE was: sensitivity 97%, speciﬁcity 88%, positive predictive value (PPV) 97% and negative predictive value (NPV) 88% on a per-patient basis. In a per valve-based analysis, the diagnostic accuracy for the detection of vegetation and abscess/pseudoaneurysm compared with surgery was: sensitivity 96%, speciﬁcity 97%, PPV 96%, NPV 97%, and sensitivity 100%, speciﬁcity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 100%, respectively, without signiﬁcant differences compared with TEE. Although the small leaﬂet perforations were missed, CT provided more accurate anatomical information regarding the perivalvular extent of abscess/ pseudoaneurysm than TEE.48 Gahide et al. found similar results in patients with aortic valve IE.49 Because prosthetic valve IE represents one of the most difﬁcult situations for echocardiographic studies, Fagman et al. recently investigated

the role of ECG-gated 64-slice CT in the diagnosis of aortic prosthetic valve IE. In 27 patients, the authors showed that the strength of agreement between ECG-gated CT and TEE was good for abscess and dehiscence, and moderate for vegetation. Compared with intraoperative ﬁndings, CT detected 3 additional pseudoaneurysms that were unnoticed by TEE. In 2 of these cases, the pseudoaneurysm was located close to the right coronary cusp, a location that is difﬁcult to investigate using TEE.47
Thus, this imaging modality offers the possibility to rapidly image the heart and other organs and thus to identify cardiac lesions and extracardiac complications, such as embolic events, infectious aneurysms, hemorrhages, and septic metastases, which can modify the therapeutic strategy. Moreover, it provides an anatomical assessment of the coronary bed, which is important in the preoperative evaluation. However, contrast products should be used with caution in patients with renal failure or hemodynamic instability because of the risk of worsening renal impairment in combination with antibiotic nephrotoxicity. In some cases, the indications for a CT scan might be limited to the brain and its arteries. Speciﬁc recommendations are needed to clearly deﬁne the appropriate situations in which this modality should be used.
MRI. Although multiple case reports demonstrate how MRI can identify valvular and perivalvular damage in patients with

IE, the identiﬁcation of silent cerebral complications appear to be its main utility. Systematic MRI detected subclinical cerebrovascular complications in approximately 50% of patients, and this might modify disease management (Fig. 3).50,51 In a single-centre study, Duval et al. described how the identiﬁcation of brain damage using cerebral MRI modiﬁed their classiﬁcation and management of 130 patients with suspected or deﬁnite endocarditis. In this work, MRI identiﬁed cerebral lesions in 82% of patients. Solely on the basis of these MRI results, and excluding microhemorrhages, the diagnostic classiﬁcation of 32% of the cases of nondeﬁnite endocarditis was upgraded to either deﬁnite or possible. Moreover, the therapeutic plans were modiﬁed for 18% of patients, including surgical plan modiﬁcations for 14%.50 The same investigators analyzed the beneﬁt of the addition of abdominal MRI in these patients; they demonstrated that cerebral and abdominal MRI ﬁndings affected diagnosis, but only cerebral MRI affected clinical management plans.52
Molecular imaging. Preliminary results have shown much promise for 18F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans in the setting of pacemaker/ deﬁbrillator leads and prosthetic valve IE.53,54 This imaging modality enables measurement of metabolic activity within an organ obtained from the emission of positrons after disintegration of the injected radioactive product. It has been used to

identify inﬂammatory and infectious processes because the inﬂammatory cells have signiﬁcant FDG uptake. Recently, we determined the value of PET/CT for diagnosing prosthetic valve endocarditis. In a sample of 71 patients, the sensitivity and a speciﬁcity of PET/CT were respectively 73% and 80%. Interestingly, adding abnormal FDG uptake around the prosthetic valve as a new major criterion signiﬁcantly increased the sensitivity of the modiﬁed Duke criteria at admission from 70% to 97% (Fig. 4). This result was due to a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of possible diagnoses.55 This work supports the use of PET/CT in the difﬁcult diagnostic situations of prosthetic valve endocarditis and thus the addition of an abnormal FDG uptake as a novel major criterion in the modiﬁed Duke classiﬁcation.55 Although the preliminary results of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis and the management of IE are encouraging, several limitations remain. Especially, false positive results of PET/CT might occur when this technique is performed too early after the implantation of the prosthetic valve. These false positive results might be related to the early postoperative inﬂammation around the sewing ring. In addition, its value in native valve IE is unknown.
The role of PET/CT also has been investigated in the diagnosis of cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. Bensimhon et al. investigated the diagnostic value of PET/CT. The authors analyzed 21 patients with suspected CIED infection and 14 control subjects free of

infection. The ﬁnal diagnosis was obtained either from bacteriological data after device culture or a 6-month followup according to modiﬁed Duke criteria. Sensitivity, speciﬁcity, PPV, and NPV were, respectively, 80%, 100%, 100%, and 84.6% in the patient-based analysis; they were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% for boxes but only 60%, 100%, 100%, and 73% for leads. None of the control patients were positive for CIED uptake.56
In another study, Ploux et al. tested the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the management of suspected CIED infections. By including 10 patients with a suspected CIED infection with negative TEE signs, the authors showed that 6 patients had an increased FDG uptake. As a result of this ﬁnding, these patients subsequently underwent complete removal of the implanted material. Cultures of the leads were positive in all 6 patients, conﬁrming involvement of the leads in the infectious process. In the other 4 patients, the pacing system was left in place without objective signs of active lead endocarditis during follow-up.57
Sarrazin et al. have made additional important contributions regarding the utility of PET/CT for suspected CIED infection. In a study including 66 patients, they conﬁrmed the relative good sensitivity (89%) and speciﬁcity (86%) of PET/ CT interpreted using a qualitative visual score. Moreover, they provided evidence that inﬂammation accompanying acute pocket surgery does not result in false positive imaging, thus

extending the applicability of this technique to suspected early device infection. The authors also demonstrated the ability to distinguish deep pocket infection, which implies device infection and the necessity for device extraction, from superﬁcial infection, which can be treated with antibiotics alone.53 Finally, PET/CT might reveal the source of infection (eg, a neoplasm such as bowel cancer).
Although the preliminary results of PET/CT in the diagnosis and the management of IE are encouraging, several questions remain. What is its value in native and prosthetic valve IE? Is it cost-effective? What is the effect of prolonged previous antibiotic therapy? What is the effect of hyperglycemia? More experience, especially with use of the new ECGgated PET/CT, is necessary before strong recommendations can be made regarding the use of this technique.
Gallium-67, indium-111 or technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime labelled-leukocyte scintigraphy is another option for imaging of infection, with or without incorporation with CT images. Unlike PET/CT, this method is more speciﬁc for infection, but is more time-consuming (24 hours).58 A recent study showed that the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity of 99mtechnetium radiolabelled leukocyte scintigraphy in patients with a suspicion of prosthetic valve IE and an inconclusive echocardiogram were 57% and 78%, respectively.59 Because of a better speciﬁcity in detection of infection, this modality might be better than PET/CT in the context of an early prosthetic valve IE suspicion.
Better knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction offers new perspectives in functional imaging of IE. Indeed, by labelling other actors involved in this unique interaction, some investigators have developed novel imaging methods from animal models.60,61
Management
Evolution of therapeutic strategies
Despite improvements in therapies, IE is associated with poor prognosis and remains a therapeutic challenge. After the introduction of antibiotics, the development of valvular surgery, especially during the active phase of the disease (early surgery), was considered to be considerable progress in the treatment of IE.62 Although this aggressive therapeutic strategy has become indispensable to save lives and to eradicate infection in many patients, reported rates of surgery remain heterogeneous, and the beneﬁcial effect of surgery on mortality is still difﬁcult to demonstrate.7 These difﬁculties result from the scarcity of randomized trials and several confounding factors that hamper the analysis of observational studies. Nevertheless, the results from most investigations are favourable for early surgical management in complicated IE. Thus, appropriate identiﬁcation of high-risk patients and their quick transfer to specialized medicosurgical centres is crucial to improve the prognosis.7,63-65 Despite this trend in treatment, most centres report an in-hospital mortality of approximately 20%, possibly because many patients are referred too late to medicosurgical institutions that are experienced in IE. Therefore, one of challenges is to rapidly introduce antibiotic treatment and, at the same time, to use strategies to identify patients who require close monitoring and urgent surgery.

Antibiotic therapy
Delayed and inappropriate antibiotic therapy has an important effect on outcome. Prompt antibiotic therapy can avoid the occurrence of severe sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and sudden death. Moreover, Dickerman and colleagues showed a 65% reduction in risk of stroke related to IE 1 week after the introduction of antibiotics.66 Therefore, when IE is suspected or conﬁrmed, antibiotic therapy should be quickly introduced after microbiological sampling. This treatment will be empirical at ﬁrst and then modiﬁed according to the microbiological results during the next few days. The molecules and doses are clearly deﬁned in the different international guidelines.13,67 Although the emergence of resistant strains is growing, present recommendations for antimicrobial treatment are based on old but efﬁcient antibiotic drugs because most pathogens that cause IE are still sensitive to them. The several new antibiotics recently tested in IE have not proved a signiﬁcant prognostic improvement compared with the traditional ones.
Risk stratiﬁcation and indications of surgery
At admission, immediate assessment of prognosis should be done to identify high-risk patients who need closer monitoring and more aggressive treatment such as early surgery. Many predictors of death have been identiﬁed, including clinical, biological, and echocardiographic variables.39,68-71 During the past decade, surgical indications have greatly increased, so we have entered into the era of early surgery. Currently, valvular surgery is performed during the active phase of the disease in approximately 40%-60% of patients.7 Although aggressive therapy has become indispensable to save lives and to eradicate infection in many patients, reported rates of surgery remain heterogeneous, and the beneﬁcial effect of surgery on mortality is still difﬁcult to show. These difﬁculties result from the scarcity of randomized trials and several confounding factors that hamper the analysis of observational studies. Nevertheless, the results from most investigations are favourable for early surgical management in complicated IE. The 2009 European guidelines provide clear recommendations on the surgical indications during the active phase of the disease (Table 3).13,72 Heart failure (HF) or high risk of HF, uncontrolled infection, and high embolic risk are the 3 main situations in which cardiac surgery is required. These guidelines have also established an optimal timing for each indication: emergency surgery (within 24 hours) or urgent surgery (within a few days) basis, irrespective of the duration of antibiotic treatment. In other cases, surgery can be postponed to allow 1 or 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment with careful clinical and echocardiographic observation before an elective surgical procedure is performed. Even though most of these recommendations are not supported by strong evidence, recently a randomized trial demonstrated that surgery performed within 48 hours after diagnosis signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of systemic embolism in patients with > 10 mm vegetation associated with severe valvular dysfunction.73
However, the patients with IE usually have comorbidities, which can increase the operative risk. Thus, an optimal management must take into account the beneﬁt/risk ratio of early valve surgery in each patient. The operative mortality in active IE is 6%-25%. Preoperative shock, HF, renal

insufﬁciency, impaired left ventricular function, prosthetic
valve IE, perivalvular abscess, and high logistic Euroscore have been identiﬁed as the strongest predictors of operative mortality.72,74,75 One perspective is to classify the prognostic

severity and the operative mortality on the basis of risk scores, which will make management decisions more standardized and easier. Recent studies have validated such risk models that incorporate clinical variables available at the bedside.69,76-78

A calculator of the embolic risk has been recently developed and validated by our team so that clinicians can easily use it.78
Indications for surgery and the perioperative approach in intravenous drug users are the same as for nonaddicts but should be more conservative overall because these patients have a much greater incidence of recurrent IE, usually because of continued drug abuse.13
Management of neurological complications
Neurological complications occur in 60%-80% of all patients with IE and are usually related to vegetation embolism.51,79-81 They include ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, infectious aneurysm, cerebral abscess, and meningitis. They are silent and only detected using cerebral CT scan or MRI in almost 50% of cases.50,51,80 Staphylococcus aureus is the causative microorganism most frequently involved.51,79 The management of patients developing these complications is difﬁcult and should be multidisciplinary including cardiologists, neurologists, microbiologists, cardiac and neurosurgeons. After the ﬁrst neurological event, most patients still have at least 1 indication for cardiac surgery, and keep a poor prognosis if this intervention is not performed or cannot be performed.79 The effect of valvular surgery on outcome in patients with cerebrovascular complications in IE has been largely debated. In the most recent series, the risk of postoperative neurological deterioration was low (0%-6%) even when surgery was performed very early after the ﬁrst neurological symptoms appeared. In fact, the risk of postoperative neurological deterioration seems to depend more on the severity of cerebrovascular complications than on the timing of surgery.51,79,81
Surgery can be performed early after neurological complications if cerebral hemorrhage has been excluded using cranial CT scan and neurological damage is not severe.58 Conversely, in cases with large intracranial hemorrhage, neurological prognosis is worse and surgery must be postponed for at least 1 month. However, if urgent cardiac surgery is needed, close cooperation with the neurosurgical team is mandatory.13,81
The management of intracranial infectious aneurysms in case of indication of cardiac surgery is difﬁcult. They should be sought in any patients with neurological symptoms using CT, MRI, or conventional angiography. Because ruptured aneurysms with severe hemorrhage carry a very poor prognosis, they should be treated using neurosurgery or endovascular therapy before cardiac surgery. In case of unruptured aneurysm, cardiac surgery can be performed ﬁrst in case of severe hemodynamic impairment, or performed after endovascular or surgical treatment in other cases.13,82
Management after the acute phase
Mortality and morbidity associated with IE might extend beyond successful treatment with a risk of death, recurrence, and need of late valvular surgery especially during the ﬁrst year after the diagnosis. Thus, after discharge, patients should be educated about how to diagnose and prevent a new episode of IE, and should be closely followed using clinical, biological, and echocardiographic evaluations (Fig. 5).13,83

1055
Conclusions IE remains a severe disease, and prevention of which has
failed. Its mortality rate remains high because the disease usually involves patients with comorbidities, the causative pathogens are virulent, and the diagnostic/therapy strategies are insufﬁcient. Novel imaging and microbiological test modalities have emerged to improve and accelerate the diagnostic process and subsequently allow a prompt therapeutic strategy to be implemented. Recent data strongly demonstrate the beneﬁcial effect of early surgical management in patients at high risk of complications and thus efforts should be made to rapidly refer IE patients to specialized medicosurgical centres.
