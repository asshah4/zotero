The authors show that genetic variants have unique electrocardiographic signatures and that particular signatures relate to dilated cardiomyopathy and early repolarization, implicating genetic loci including BAG3, TMEM43, PRKCA, OBSCN, DKK1, and KCDN3.

Highlights
d Spatiotemporal analysis of the electrocardiogram identiﬁes over 300 genetic loci
d Individual genetic variants exhibit unique electrocardiographic signatures
d A particular genetic ECG signature is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy
d Disease-associated variants can be found using the electrocardiogram

SUMMARY
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most useful non-invasive diagnostic tests for a wide array of cardiac disorders. Traditional approaches to analyzing ECGs focus on individual segments. Here, we performed comprehensive deep phenotyping of 77,190 ECGs in the UK Biobank across the complete cycle of cardiac conduction, resulting in 500 spatial-temporal datapoints, across 10 million genetic variants. In addition to characterizing polygenic risk scores for the traditional ECG segments, we identiﬁed over 300 genetic loci that are statistically associated with the high-dimensional representation of the ECG. We established the genetic ECG signature for dilated cardiomyopathy, associated the BAG3, HSPB7/CLCNKA, PRKCA, TMEM43, and OBSCN loci with disease risk and conﬁrmed this association in an independent cohort. In total, our work demonstrates that a high-dimensional analysis of the entire ECG provides unique opportunities for studying cardiac biology and disease and furthering drug development. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

INTRODUCTION
Since its original description in 1893 by Willem van Einthoven, the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been instrumental in the recognition of a wide array of cardiac disorders (AlGhatrif and Lindsay, 2012; Das and Zipes, 2012). The ECG is one of the most useful non-invasive diagnostic tests for many cardiac disorders as it informs about the presence of cardiac structure abnormalities, such as chamber enlargement, conduction disturbances, and arrythmias. It also provides indication of electrolyte imbalance and drug toxicity. So far, genetic studies of the ECG identiﬁed more than hundred genetic loci (Arking et al., 2014; van den Berg et al., 2017; Bihlmeyer et al., 2018; Eppinga et al., 2016; van der Harst et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2018; Prins et al., 2018; Roselli et al., 2018; van Setten et al., 2018; Verweij et al., 2016) but have focused around speciﬁc ECG fragments representing peak characteristics such as the PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval.
Current genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of cardiac conduction provided insights into cardiac (conduction) biology by pointing out new genetic loci and genes. However, one of the major limitations of this approach is that it ignores the highdimensional nature of the ECG. It is also challenging to compare

ﬁndings across different ECG GWASs because the traits themselves are fragmented across the ECG, measured in different populations, using different methods, and disseminated across different publications.
We aimed to overcome these limitations by following the effects of individual genetic variants through the complete cardiac cycle the ECG represents, in order to identify additional insights into cardiac biology and disease. To this end, we downloaded, processed over 70,000 3-lead ECG recordings of the UK Biobank. For each individual, we averaged the ECG recording of multiple heart beats down to 500 data points that represented one normal cardiac conduction cycle in rest, and we refer to it as the ‘‘ECG morphology phenotype.’’ The 500 data points can be seen as 500 traits or timepoints that each represents separate segments of the cardiac cycle. Aggerating these data across all individuals, on a population level, we then studied how the ECG morphology phenotype was inﬂuenced by genetics. We show that genetic variants are not bound by classical interpretations of the ECG but have unique association signatures across the ECG, or ‘‘genetic ECG signatures.’’ By exploiting aberrant genetic ECG signatures, we identiﬁed genetic loci and endo-phenotypes for cardiac disorders. Our results demonstrate how an integrated approach to analyze high-dimensional data can

RESULTS
An enhanced understanding of the inﬂuence of genetic variants on the complete cardiac cycle represented by the ECG could generate new hypotheses on cardiac physiology, disease, and effects of drugs. To better characterize the impact of genetic variants on the ECG, we obtained all 77,190 3-lead ECGs of the UK Biobank that contained raw signal data necessary for the analysis. After individual-level and population-level quality control to remove abnormal beats and ECGs (Simson, 1981) (STAR Methods; Figure 1), 63,706 individuals remained for the primary analyses. The primary ECG morphology phenotype was constructed by averaging the cardiac cycle that the ECG represents. We segmented the cardiac cycle into 500 data points representing ECG voltages along a 1,000 ms window, dictated by the 500 hz ECG sampling rate. To study the possible effects of heart rate, we performed additional, secondary, analyses in which we normalized that representation for the individual beat-to-beat variation (the R-R interval) and refer to it as the ‘‘R-R adjusted’’ ECG morphology phenotype.
To demonstrate that this approach also captures the classical ECG traits, we used previously described genetic variants in

aggregate and isolation to visualize their morphological effect on the ECG (Arking et al., 2014; van den Berg et al., 2017; Bihlmeyer et al., 2018; Eppinga et al., 2016; van der Harst et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2018; Prins et al., 2018; Roselli et al., 2018; van Setten et al., 2018; Verweij et al., 2016). By plotting 500 association signals of each datapoint as Àlog10 p values along the time axis of one beat (Figure 2), we found that the polygenic risk score of PR interval associated with a shift of the P wave; the polygenetic risk score of QRS duration associated with Q and S wave durations; the polygenic risk score of 12lead sum area matched the area under the curve of the QRS complex; and the polygenetic risk score of QT-time associated with T wave prolongation. To obtain insights into the potential effects of heart rate on cardiac conduction and ECG amplitudes, we included the R-R-adjusted ECG morphology phenotype as a secondary analysis to show the potential effect of heart rate on the genetic ECG signatures. The classical ECG traits are largely unaffected by heart rate (Data S1, related to Figure 2), but the polygenic score of heart rate shows a very different genetic ECG signature for the R-R-adjusted phenotype, as expected (Figure 2).
When individual variants of these risk scores were plotted, a plethora of different ECG morphologies was observed, suggesting that they are not bound by classic ECG patterns and indicate

Figure 2. Polygenic Risk Scores of ECG Indices Are Associated with the Trait Expected Segments of the ECG For each of the classical ECG traits we calculated polygenic scores and associated them with each of the data points that make up the ECG morphology phenotype. The left y axis depicts the micro voltage scale, the y axis on the right indicates the signed Àlog10(p values). The x axis is time in milliseconds (ms) or percentage (%) from the R-R in the case of the R-R-adjusted ECG morphology phenotype. The blue lines are the average ECG amplitude of the full cohort and the red lines the p value for association with each datapoint of the ECG morphology phenotype (n = 500 time points) on a log10 scale, signed to show direction of association. The dashed vertical black lines mark point of strongest negative and positive association. Additional plots for the R-R-adjusted ECG phenotype and sensitivity analyses can be found in the appendix.

showing a genetic ECG signature consistent with the genetic ECG signature of atrial ﬁbrillation. The loci encompassing TTN and PLN, however, show very different genetic ECG signatures not captured by any of the polygenic risk scores in Figure 2.

Figure 3. Genetic Variants Display Unique Morphological Signatures and the Heritability Is Highest at ECG Segments Showing Greatest Electrical Activity (A) A heatmap of the genetic ECG signatures that were previously found to be associated with atrial ﬁbrillation. We normalized the genetic ECG signatures of genetic variants in order to compare the effects across loci. Effects were orientated to the most positively associated allele across all time points and colored in red on the heatmap; a blue color indicates a negative effect while yellow indicates no effect. On the left side is the unadjusted ECG phenotype, on the right side the R-R-adjusted ECG phenotype. (B) Excerpts of genetic ECG signatures for previously reported genetic variants, plotted in the same way as the polygenic risk scores in Figure 2. The red line indicates the signed Àlog10(p value) for association across the heartbeat. And the blue line the average ECG amplitudes in the population. (C) The SNP heritability’s (h2g) are plotted in red for the unadjusted and the R-R interval-adjusted ECG morphology phenotype. The SNP heritability was highest for the ECG morphology phenotype unadjusted for the R-R interval (left plots). The maximum observed heritability was 0.29 (SE = 0.01) at the ST-wave segment. Heritability estimates were high for ECG segments that have high electrical activity, consistent with molecular mechanism of cardiac conduction. The plots on the bottom shows the pairwise Pearson correlation matrix on the phenotype level between each ECG datapoint across the ECG morphology phenotypes. Red indicates a high positive correlation, blue indicates a high negative correlation, yellow indicates no correlation; both the x and y axes depict the ECG in time and match the average ECG amplitudes plotted on the top.

TTN encodes titin, the largest known human protein and major component of the muscle’s sarcomere. PLN encodes phospholamban, which inhibits calcium uptake by the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-2 (SERCA-2) pump, involved in atrial and ventricular relaxation.

To better understand the contribution of common genetic vari-
ation to the ECG morphology phenotype in general, we studied the SNP heritability (h2g). Here, we observed that electrically active (non-isoelectric) ECG points are more heritable than iso-
electric points, consistent with what would be expected based

Figure 4. Unbiased Clustering Maps Main Effects of Genetic Variants on the Electrocardiogram (A) Manhattan plot of the ECG morphology phenotype (smallest p value across all traits is shown), variants in red indicate those passing p < 5 3 10À8, the top loci have been annotated with their nearby genes. (B) The t-SNE plot was derived from a large matrix that contained all genetic ECG signatures (signed -log(p) values) for all lead genetic variants that were identiﬁed in the GWAS. An interactive t-SNE plot is available on www.ecgenetics.org.

on the molecular mechanisms (see Figure 3C). This analysis also suggested that amplitudes between the S and T wave (the ST segment) are highly heritable, suggesting that this part of the ECG may be particularly interesting.
Next, we performed GWAS on the amplitude of each of the 500 temporal data points of the ECG generating 500 association values per genetic variant (STAR Methods). In total 414 independent (r2 < 0.001) genetic variants were identiﬁed in 331 2-MB regions at the traditional genome-wide signiﬁcance threshold (p < 5 3 10À8) or 203 independent variants in 166 2-MB regions at the stringent Bonferroni-corrected signiﬁcance level (p < 6.25 3 10À10). These 414 independent genetic variants were assigned to 584 candidate genes (Figure 4A; Tables S1, S2, and S3). Of all 331 ECG-associated regions, 127 were shared (1-MB-re-

gion-based) with loci found in prior GWASs of classical ECG traits and 64 regions were shared with the atrial ﬁbrillation phenotype (Tables S1 and S4), at the time of this study. We identiﬁed 179 genetic association signals that had not been reported before (Arking et al., 2014; van den Berg et al., 2017; Bihlmeyer et al., 2018; Christophersen et al., 2017; Eppinga et al., 2016; van der Harst et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2018; Prins et al., 2018; Roselli et al., 2018; van Setten et al., 2018; Verweij et al., 2014, 2016). The impact of all genome-wide signiﬁcant genetic variants on ECG morphology is plotted in Data S3, these and all other genetic variants can also be viewed online in our ECG browser (http://www.ecgenetics.org). The three strongest observed association signals were for rs7132327 (p = 4 3 10À140) near TBX3, rs6801957 (p = 3310À133) near SCN5A, and rs2074238

(p = 2 3 10À129) in KCNQ1. The most signiﬁcant pathways by DEPICT were ‘‘heart development’’ and ‘‘decreased cardiac muscle contractility.’’ The most signiﬁcant tissues identiﬁed by DEPICT were ‘‘heart,’’ ‘‘heart ventricles,’’ and ‘‘heart atria’’ (Tables S5 and S6).
To group genetic variants with similar main effects on the ECG we performed unbiased clustering of the normalized ECG morphology association proﬁles. This analysis suggested 5 subsets of genetic effects on the ECG (Figure 4B). Four clusters A, B, D, and E contained variants that associated primarily with differences in ECG’s Q wave, P wave, R-S wave, and T wave morphology, respectively (Figure 4C). The 5th cluster (cluster C) contained a diversity of ECG morphologies affecting the edges of the ECG and inﬂuence a component of heart rate. Although genetic variants grouped into a cluster sharing morphological features, many expressed unique features within each cluster, pointing toward differences in underlying biology. Differential pathway analysis on each cluster identiﬁed cluster A related to the Q wave to be speciﬁcally enriched for 132 pathways related to cardiac muscle function including terms like ‘‘dilated cardiomyopathy,’’ ‘‘cardiac muscle contraction,’’ and ‘‘ventricular septal defect’’ (Table S5).
To exploit the potential for obtaining clinical insights of this resource, we focused on a particular point of the Q-wave cluster that showed strong overlap with dilated cardiopathy risk. rs2234962 in BAG3 was among the most signiﬁcant loci (p < 5 3 10À54) in our analysis that have not been reported previously in GWASs of the ECG. The genetic ECG signature for this variant concentrated around the Q-R upslope of the ECG at À18 ms from the R wave (Figure 5, http://www.ecgenetics.org). This variant was previously identiﬁed in a GWAS of dilated cardiopathy (Meder et al., 2014; Stark et al., 2010; Villard et al., 2011). Another previously unreported ECG locus was rs1763604 near HSPB7/CLCNKA (p < 5 3 10À20), this variant has also been identiﬁed by the same GWAS of dilated cardiopathy and exhibiting the same ECG pattern as BAG3 (Figure 5), suggesting that this particular genetic ECG signature of the Q-R wave may have something in common with dilated cardiomyopathy. BAG3 is part of the conserved family of cyto-protective co-chaperone proteins. The gene is mainly expressed in striated muscle and the protein colocalizes with the Z disc of the sarcomere. The locus encompassing HSPB7/CLCNKA includes two potential candidate causal genes. CLCNKA encodes a renal ClC-Ka chloride channel; however, HSPB7 may be a more likely candidate gene as it is expressed in cardiomyocytes. HSPB7 is a member of the small heat shock protein family. The protein is located in the intercalated disc adjacent to the Z line of the adult cardiac muscle and is essential for maintaining integrity of myoﬁber

structure and cardiac conduction (Liao et al., 2017). The genetic associations for rs2234962 and rs1763604 persisted in individuals not diagnosed with dilated cardiopathy or other cardiac conditions (Table S7), indicating that dilated cardiomyopathy patients are not driving the associations between these variants and the ECG at À18 ms.
The observation that the ECG captures information relevant to dilated cardiopathy is important because it shows that geneticdisease associations can be found in healthy individuals using an inexpensive ECG test. Dilated cardiopathy is a severe disease with poor prognosis: the 5-year survival rate after diagnosis is only 50%, yet the disease can be asymptomatic for a long time. One hypothesis is that the Q-R wave marks sub-clinical dilated cardiopathy and reﬂects the structural integrity of the heart relevant for dilated cardiopathy risk. It is notable that here is no clear single diagnosis criterion of the ECG for dilated cardiopathy (Bozkurt et al., 2016; Japp et al., 2016).
We hypothesized that this Q-R upslope feature represents a biomarker for dilated cardiopathy. To test this, we carried out an ECG-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) (ﬁxed effects inverse variance weighted method) in UK Biobank to reveal the genetic ECG signature for dilated cardiopathy. This analysis conﬁrmed that À18 ms was most associated with dilated cardiopathy but also revealed a secondary effect just before the Q-R wave (Figure 5A).
To further substantiate the hypotheses that the Q-R upslope at À18 ms is associated with dilated cardiopathy, we executed a more detailed MR analyses using up to 47 genetic variants that are associated with amplitudes of À18 ms. Here, we observed that there is a consistent relationship between the genetic ECG signature and increased risk of dilated cardiopathy (Figure 5C; Tables S8 and S9). These ﬁndings remained consistent in several sensitivity analyses, across the UK Biobank and the independent MAGNet study cohort. Also, exclusion of the 2 previously known variants did not change our ﬁndings (Figure 5E).
In addition to the known BAG3 and CLCNKA loci, we identiﬁed 3 other variants for dilated cardiopathy passing the Bonferroni signiﬁcant threshold (p < 0.001) by using the Q-R slope trait as ‘‘bait’’: rs9909004 (p = 3.5 3 10À4) in PRKCA, rs4685090 (p = 4.2 3 10À6) near TMEM43, and rs60836537 (p = 1.4 3 10À4) in OBSCN (Figure 5C; Tables S8 and S9). The PRKCA locus encodes the enzyme protein kinase C alpha that has previously been identiﬁed to be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy via its role in adverse left ventricular modeling (Hu et al., 2018). PRKCA affects dephosphorylation of cardiac the phospholamban (PLN) involved in inhibiting the SERCA2 pump. Mutations in TMEM43 (transmembrane protein 43) are commonly identiﬁed as a cause for right ventricular dysplasia subtype 5 (Calkins et al.,

time point of the ECG as instrumental variables and dilated cardiomyopathy as outcome variable. The red lines indicate the p value for association with each datapoint of the ECG morphology phenotype (n = 500 time points) on a log10 scale, signed to show direction of association.

2017). However, the exact molecular function of TMEM43 and its role in cardiac biology is unknown. OBSCN encodes Obscurin, a large 720-kDa multidomain protein that plays a primary role in the formation and stabilization of the sarcomere, it harbors mutations causing hypertrophic and dilated cardiopathy (Marston, 2017). In total 13 of 47 variants were nominally associated (p < 0.05) with dilated cardiopathy, which is considerably more than expected by chance (Pbinomial = 3.4 3 10À7). These analyses support this new hypothesis that the Q-R slope differences are linked to dilated cardiopathy risk and that it is a powerful tool to study the genetics of this disease. Further functional studies are important to understand the nature of these associations and how this genetic ECG signature can be used in precision medicine approaches (Rosenbaum et al., 2020), used as a biomarker, used for stratiﬁcation, or used to monitor progression of dilated cardiomyopathy.
Other examples of cardiac diseases in which the ECG is critical for clinical diagnosis include early repolarization. The diagnosis of this condition is based on strict criteria of passing a certain threshold on the ECG. We hypothesized that the biological underpinnings of early repolarization do not adhere to a strict binary phenomenon and that our understanding can be enhanced by studying continuous traits as well. Recently, a GWAS of the strict binary deﬁnition of early repolarization identiﬁed one locus, rs1545300 in KCND3 (Teumer et al., 2019). When analyzing the full ECG morphology of rs1545300, we observed an association peak at 44 ms after the R wave that coincided with the early repolarization criterion (Figure 5B, http://www. ecgenetics.org). We used this 44-ms data point as ‘‘bait’’ to identify 8 additional loci possibly relevant to early repolarization at p < 5 3 10À8 (Table S10). We tested these for association with early repolarization in the independent LifeLines cohort (Figures 5F and 5G; Tables S8 and S9). Two loci (1 known and 1 novel) were signiﬁcant at the Bonferroni level: rs776293589 (KCND3, p = 1.05310À7) and rs1733724 (DKK1, p = 1.8 3 10À3), and 5 out of 9 variants showed a suggestive association (p < 0.05), more than expected by chance (Pbinomial = 3.3 3 10À5). KCDN3 encodes Kv4.3 that is responsible for the transient outward potassium current, I(to), and important for the early phase of repolarization. DKK1 encodes the Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 and may be involved in regulating Wnt signaling that is responsible for cell fate during formation of the heart.
One of the most prominent genetic loci inﬂuencing electrocardiographic traits and diseases is the SCN5A locus. SCN5A encodes the alpha subunit of the main cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and has a critical role in regulation of cardiac electrophysiological function. SCN5A has been found causative for a variety of cardiomyopathies and cardiac arrythmias including atrial ﬁbrillation, long QT syndrome, and the Brugada syndrome. Common variants in or near SCN5A have been associated with almost all ECG traits (Arking et al., 2014; van den Berg et al., 2017; Bihlmeyer et al., 2018; Christophersen et al., 2017; Eppinga et al., 2016; van der Harst et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2018; Prins et al., 2018; Roselli et al., 2018; van Setten et al., 2018; Verweij et al., 2014, 2016). Because this is such a prominent locus for cardiac electrophysiology, we aimed to dissect the complex genetic architecture of SCN5A by leveraging the power multiple ECG traits. We performed a comprehensive conditional analysis across the entire ECG morphology phenotype by taking into account all 1,000

ECG traits simultaneously (see STAR Methods). Using this multivariate approach, we identiﬁed 10 independent variants in the SCN5A locus with an effect on one or more of the 500 data points of the ECG morphology (at p < 5 3 10À8). The identiﬁed variants all coincide with cardiac enhancer mark, which was more than expected by chance, Phypergeometric = 1 3 10À7. This ﬁnding suggests that the causal common variants at SCN5A are likely to be of regulatory nature and provides support for the hypothesis that the identiﬁed variants may be causal. We found that these 10 independent SCN5A variants have different morphological ECG signatures, possibly pointing toward different biological mechanisms and consequences for the cardiac conduction system (Data S4; Table S11).
DISCUSSION
Although genetic inﬂuences of the ECG have long been established, these analyses have mainly been based on isolated segments of the ECG (Arking et al., 2014; van den Berg et al., 2017; Bihlmeyer et al., 2018; Eppinga et al., 2016; van der Harst et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2018; Prins et al., 2018; Roselli et al., 2018; van Setten et al., 2018; Verweij et al., 2016). In this study, we provide the ﬁrst high-dimensional analyses of the ECG that is not limited by a deﬁnition of classically deﬁned ECG features. Studying the complete ECG in an integrative manner provided a unique opportunity to obtain more meaningful insights into biology compared with studying individual ECG fragments one at a time.
We identiﬁed over 300 genome-wide genetic loci, of which the majority have not been reported before in relation to the ECG. These loci showed unique association signatures on the ECG. For example, variants near genes encoding potassium and calcium channels exhibited different signatures, suggesting differences in ion-channel activity during the cardiac cycle. These data provide unique insights into the biological mechanisms of cardiac physiology and could inform in silico models of cardiac conduction (Sadrieh et al., 2014).
We expect that these types of integrative analyses of genome and phenome data, leveraging many correlated traits at the same time, can be applied to other high-dimensional datasets as well, such as lipidomic and metabolomics data. This will be essential to move the GWAS ﬁeld forward and to provide more useful information compared with studying individual traits in isolation.
Study Limitations First, we were only able to interrogate common genetic variants in the UK Biobank, future efforts should integrate rare coding variants once the full exome sequencing data become available. This will be particularly relevant considering their prominent role in dilated cardiomyopathy (Rosenbaum et al., 2020) and other cardiac disorders. Second, the ECG device to measure cardiac conduction consisted of only 3 electrodes that were attached to the limbs, these surface ECG parameters are not speciﬁc enough to identify the exact anatomical region of the heart. However, there are currently no single large genetic datasets available of more precise measurements, such that they could be derived from more sophisticated surface ECG equipment or intra-cardiac ECG measurements. Third, the individuals that our study is based on are predominantly of European ancestry, it is unclear if conclusions can be extrapolated to other ethnic

groups. Fourth, this work is based on statistical analyses and does not provide functional experimental validation; the genetic variants and genes that are prioritized require further experimental validation.
Key Changes Prompted by Reviewer Comments In response to reviewer comments we lightly modiﬁed our main text and ﬁgures to better highlight the main ﬁndings contained in them. Although the reviewers did not ask for more work, we added the genetic ECG signature of dilated cardiomyopathy as part of Figure 5. We also added additional information about the genes in the results section. For context, the complete transparent peer review record is included within the Supplemental Information.

METHOD DETAILS
UK Biobank Individuals Participants were recruited with an age range of 40-69 that registered with a general practitioner of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Between 2006–2010, a total of 503,325 individuals were recruited to participate. All study participants provided informed consent and the study was approved by the North West Multi-center Research Ethics Committee. Detailed methods used by UK Biobank have been described elsewhere(Bycroft et al., 2018). The prevalence and incidence of cardiac conditions and events were captured by data collected at the Assessment Centre in-patient Health Episode Statistics (HES) download on September 10, 2017.
Genotyping and Imputation The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics performed quality control before imputation, and imputed the genotypes to the HRC v1.1 reference panel that was released on March 7th 2018. For the current analysis, individual sample outliers excluded based on heterozygosity and missingness were excluded, as well as those with gender discrepancies between the reported and inferred gender using X-chromosome heterozygosity test. A detailed description of the quality control and imputation, is available elsewhere(Bycroft et al., 2018).
ECG Morphology Phenotypes and Quality Control Three-lead exercise ECG data were provided by the UK Biobank as bulk in separate xml-ﬁles. To isolate R-waves, we employed the gQRS algorithm by George Moody, the construe algorithm was used to further reﬁne the localization of R-waves (Teijeiro et al., 2018). Individual ECG beats were processed and averaged (Simson, 1981), which we refer to as the ‘ECG morphology’ phenotype.
Two entities of ECG morphology were constructed: The primary morphology trait was deﬁned as the classical signal averaged electrocardiographic beat (Simson, 1981) that consisted of an averaged 1,000 ms window surrounding the R wave at a resolution of 500hz resulting in 500 averaged data points or ECG traits for each individual. As such, these beats were unadjusted for individual R-R intervals. The secondary ‘ECG morphology’ trait consisted of R-R intervals made of equal length (500 data points) so that the resulting averaged ECG beat was adjusted for each individual R-R interval.
Only information of the rest phase was used, as deﬁned by the ﬁrst 15 seconds of ECG assessment. From all 99,539 3-lead ECGs recorded in 96,567 participants, 77,190 ECGs contained full disclosure data necessary to detect R wave. The R-wave is traditionally used as a reference point to detect all other points on the ECG, hence this should be sufﬁcient to identify major changes ECG beat, while also easy to understand and visualize.
Before signal averaging, ECG beats were quality controlled on the individual level. First, the 3-leads were averaged to create a single ECG signal vector. Then, individual beats containing excess noise were removed as described previously(van de Vegte et al., 2018; Verweij et al., 2018), this was based on a moving standard deviation using a window-size of 3 data points under the assumption that ECG signals without noise have a moving standard deviation close to 0. Thirdly, individual beats were matched on a template and discarded if they were dissimilar based on a Pearson correlation function between each beat; beats with mean negative correlations and those that fell outside the standard 1.5 interquartile range rule were removed. This procedure was repeated until no outlier beats were left to exclude. At least 6 beats were required at any stage of the averaging process; otherwise the entire electrocardiogram was excluded from the analysis. We explored whether the averaging process was improved when accounting for the lag at which the cross-correlation function between each ECG beats shows its maximum, but this did not make a difference; suggesting that the R-wave detection was already sufﬁcient. In total 67,440 ECGs of 66,240 individuals passed the individual level quality control.
Finally, to further detect and exclude abnormal ECGs on the population level, we calculated the standard deviation of the difference between each averaged ECG beat of an individual and the population-mean averaged ECG beat; outliers were discarded according to the standard 1.5 interquartile range rule per ECG-phenotype. Observations of the second follow-up visits were used when no baseline observation was available. This resulted in the inclusion of 63,706 individuals in the primary analysis (unadjusted R-R intervals). The 2,534 excluded individuals based on population level QC were much more likely to be diagnosed with a history of bundle branch block (OR=16.8, se= 3.1, z=15.41), cardiomyopathy (OR=8.8 se=2.3, z=8.58), myocardial infarction (OR=2.9, se=0.27, z=12.2), atrial ﬁbrillation (OR=2.0, se=0.25, z=5.6), and heart failure (OR=7.3, se=1.2,z=12.55). For the secondary morphology phenotype (where we adjusted for R-R intervals), 65,183 individuals remained.
Another 3,750 individuals with a history of myocardial infarction, atrial ﬁbrillation, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, bundle-branchblock or pacemaker implantation were excluded in sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Diagnoses in UK Biobank were deﬁned as follows: myocardial infarction (ICD10: I21, I22, I23, I252; ICD9: 410, 412 or self-reported myocardial infarction), atrial ﬁbrillation (ICD10:I48; ICD9: 4273, OPCS-4: K621, K622, K623 or self-reported atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter), heart failure (ICD10: I50, I110, I130, I132; ICD9: 428 or self-reported heart failure), cardiomyopathy (ICD10: I42, I43, O903, I255, O944; ICD9: 425 or self-reported cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), dilated cardiomyopathy (ICD10:I42.0 or ICD9: 4254), bundle-branch-block (ICD10: I447, I451 or ICD9: 4263, 4264) or pacemaker implantation (OPCS-4: K59, K60, K61 or self-reported pacemaker or deﬁbrillator insertion). Diagnoses in UK Biobank were extracted using https://github.com/niekverw/ukpheno.
Polygenic Scores of ECG-Traits and Known Genetic Variants Polygenic risk scores were created following an additive model for atrial ﬁbrillation, QT-interval, QRS duration, PR-interval, QRSvoltage traits (12-lead sum area, cornel area and Sokolow-Lyon area) and heart rate separately (Table S13), as previously described (Verweij et al., 2017). In short, the number of alleles for each individual (0, 1 or 2) was summed after multiplying the alleles with the previously reported effect size of the variant-trait association. Effect sizes estimated in UK Biobank data were avoided to reduce potential overestimation. If multiple effect sizes were available, those estimated in the largest sample size were used (e.g., the combined replication and discovery phase). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were excluded if they were missing in UK Biobank data. In instances where multiple correlated variants in the same locus were reported for the same trait, we used only independent variants that were selected by the linkage disequilibrium clumping procedure (at r2 < 0.01) implemented in PLINK version 1.9.
Pathway Analyses and Candidate Genes DEPICT was employed to discover pathways, tissues and genes underlying GWAS-loci of the electrocardiographic morphology phenotype. Please see Pers et al. for a detailed description of the method(Pers et al., 2015). All independently associated variants (r2>0.005) passing a traditional genome wide signiﬁcance threshold P < 5 x 10-8 were used as input to the DEPICT framework. DEPICT was run using default settings. Because DEPICT uses 1000 Genomes as a reference panel which does not include certain UK Biobank speciﬁc variants, we also included all variants in LD (r2>0.8) with the input-variants to ensure 100% coverage of the signal. Pairwise correlations across all signiﬁcantly enriched pathways (false discovery rate > 0.5%) were computed and visualized using the Gephi software (www.gephi.org) after ﬁltering out edges with correlations lower than 0.5.
For the differential pathway analysis, we repeated the DEPICT pathway analysis but excluded variants that were of interest (variants-of-interest). We calculated the reduction in pathway enrichment by subtracting the –log10(P) for enrichment before and after excluding variants-of-interest. A null distribution was created by repeating the DEPICT run 100 times on the same set of variants but each time excluding a matched number of random variants not belonging to the variants-of-interest. If all 100 null runs indicated that the reduction in signiﬁcance for a given pathway was more using the variants-of-interest than for the null runs (indicating Pdifferential<0.01), the pathway was considered to be differentially enriched for the variants-of-interest. Particularly, we were interested whether different biological pathways were active at different ECG intervals. To test this, we used the clusters of variants that were identiﬁed in the unbiased clustering approach by t-sne and k-means as ‘variants-of-interest’ (see Genetics and association testing); which grouped variants by their primary effect on the different ECG wave intervals in an unbiased manner.
Nearest gene or any gene within 10kb of the lead variants were used to annotate candidate causal genes. We also searched for coding variants in LD with the identiﬁed variants (r2>0.8) to further prioritize candidate causal genes. Variants were also annotated by proximity (250kb) to known rare genetic cardiac disease genes in Orphanet, code ORPHA:97929. An additional line of evidence for candidate causal genes was performed by DEPICT, taking into account gene-gene similarities across loci(Pers et al., 2015). We speciﬁcally did not incorporate annotations from datasets such as Hi-C and eQTL, as we strongly believe these may not be informative for cardiac conduction biology and need targeted experiments on a per locus basis to interpret them (Stacey et al., 2019; Wang and Goldstein, 2020).
Dilated Cardiomyopathy The association between genetic variants and risk of dilated cardiomyopathy was tested in case-control GWASes of UK Biobank and MAGNet (Myocardial Applied Genomics Network) and combined via inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis to increase power totaling 1,375 cases and 241,325 controls.
In the UK Biobank cohort individuals with and without dilated cardiomyopathy were selected to be independent of those taking part in the ECG measurements. 744 dilated cardiomyopathy cases were identiﬁed according to ICD10 and ICD9 codes (I42.0 and 4254), 239,729 control individuals were not diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and had no family history of heart disease. Association testing was performed as described under ‘Genetic and association testing’, coefﬁcients were re-scaled to log odds.
For the MAGNet study, 631 subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy were recruited; patients were included in the study if they were diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (< 40%) in the absence of hypertension, primary valvular disease, or coronary artery disease from the University of Pennsylvania Health System; 1,596 controls were recruited from the same center who had no history of heart disease. All subjects provided written informed consent. Genotyping was performed on the Illumina OmniExpressExome Array and imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project with Minimac. Genotypes between cases and controls were compared using an additive genetic model adjusting for gender and two principal components of race using SNPtest; there was no genomic inﬂation (1.0335).

Early Repolarization To assess the clinical relevance of the ECG morphology phenotypes in early repolarization, we diagnosed individuals 1,253 with and 11,463 without early repolarization of the Lifelines cohort. For this, 12-lead ECGs were manually curated by trained cardiologists for the presence of early repolarization according to the established deﬁnition by Haisaguerre and Macfarlane(Haı¨ssaguerre et al., 2008; Macfarlane et al., 2015). The criteria for early repolarization were deﬁned as an elevation of the J-point (R0.1 mV) in at least two corresponding leads above the level of QRS onset. Leads V1 to V3 were excluded from scoring to avoid confusion or overlap with Brugada syndrome or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. The morphology of early repolarization was assessed as either notching, slurring or both. The ST segment was deﬁned according to Tikkanen et al. as either rapidly ascending (concave) or horizontal descending(Tikkanen et al., 2011). ECGs with QRS duration > 120 ms or non-sinus rhythm (for example atrial ﬁbrillation or pacemaker rhythm) were excluded from the analysis. Inter-observer correlations have been described previously(Bastiaenen et al., 2019).
Exhaustive Joint Conditional Analysis of the SCN5A Locus The SCN5A locus has been reported in almost all cardiac conduction GWAS with various independent lead SNPs, it harbors many mutations causing different types of arrhythmias, and it encodes an essential sodium channel Nav1.5 that is a common target of antiarrhythmic drugs. To further increase our understanding of complex genetics at SCN5A, we performed an exhaustive joint conditional analysis across all ECG datapoints. Finemapping this locus and understanding the consequences of the multiple genetic variants at play may improve our understanding of this gene and cardiac disease pathophysiology.
We performed an in-depth conditional analysis of this locus using information of the entire ECG using a deterministic approach. For this, a stepwise conditional analysis was conducted followed by the full model containing all of the identiﬁed SNPs P< x 10-8; after this the stepwise conditional analysis was redone with as starting point the SNPs that were also the lead SNP in the full model. This was repeated until all SNPs in the model were the lead associated SNP in the full model.
The ﬁrst stepwise model including all 1309 variants between 38500000 and 38900000bp on chromosome 3 identiﬁed 11 genetic variants. After 3 iterations, a ﬁnal model was constructed of 10 genetic variants that were independently associated and also the topassociated variants across all ECG association analyses. Please see Table S11 for more information on the exact conﬁgurations that were tested and Supplementary Data Figure S4 for the conditional regional association plots and impact on ECG morphology for both the univariate and joint (including all 10 variants) model.
Notably, all of the 10 genetic variants were located in a cardiac enhancer (https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg). When summarizing the overlap of all variants in the SCN5A region, only 21% overlapped with a cardiac enhancer. The fact that we ﬁnd all (10 out of 10) genetic variants to overlap a cardiac enhancer represents a considerable enrichment (P=1x10-7, hypergeometric test) on the single locus level.
Previously identiﬁed genetic variants for Brugada syndrome at rs10428132 and rs11708996 were also found back as independent signals in this analysis. Rs10428132 was the genetic variant with the lowest P values overall and was ﬁne-mapped to rs6801957; rs11708996 was in perfect LD with rs41312411, highlighting that this approach is able to capture disease relevant genetic variants. Both variants had a strong effect on the P-wave interval, whereas Brugada is characterized by ST abnormalities, the syndrome is also known to present a concealed abnormal atrial, P-wave, phenotype (Conte et al., 2018). Rs41312411 also has a speciﬁc effect on the beginning of the QRS-complex, which seems to affect Q-R duration and/or Q amplitude.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Genetics and Regression Analyses All of the genetic analyses in UK Biobank that are reported in this manuscript have been adjusted for age, gender, BMI, height and the ﬁrst 30 principal components (PCAs) to account for population stratiﬁcation, and genotyping array (Affymetrix UK Biobank AxiomÒ array or Affymetrix UK BiLEVE Axiom array). The ECG variables were inverse rank normalized prior to association analyses
Genome wide association analyses in UK Biobank were performed using BOLT-LMM v2.3beta2. BOLT-LMM ﬁts a mixed linear model that accounts for the population structure and cryptic relatedness.(Loh et al., 2015) For this, directly genotyped variants were used that passed quality control, and which were extracted from the imputed dataset to ensure 100% call rate, and pruned on linkage disequilibrium (ﬁrst r2 < 0.05 and a second round of r2<0.045) to obtain roughly 400k variants across the genome. The genomic control lambda’s, heritability by BOLT-LMM, LD-Score intercepts and the attenuation ratio statistics are listed in Table S12, these suggested no inﬂation due to non-polygenic signals (Loh et al., 2018). Regression analyses of genetic risk scores and individual genetic variant associations across the ECG-morphologies were performed with sandwich robust standard errors that were clustered by family to account for relatedness in STATA-MP v15. Families were inferred from the kinship matrix, clustering all 3rd degree relatives or higher together (kinship coefﬁcient > 0.0442).
For the GWAS we focused on the ECG morphology unadjusted for R-R interval as it was more powerful compared to the R-R adjusted morphology phenotype; higher heritability, captured the large majority of previously identiﬁed genetic variants of the ECG and was easiest to interpret. We performed 500 GWASes, one for each time-point. Using an eigenvalue-based measure(Galwey, 2009), we estimated that testing the 500 ECG data points resulted in effectively 79.9 independent tests and therefore used an alpha of 5x10-8/80 = 6.25x10-10 to indicate Bonferroni corrected genome wide signiﬁcance.

Normalized association proﬁles of variants were plotted as heatmaps where red colors indicate the most strongly associated effect at a time point and the blue color the most strongly associated effect in the opposite direction. To visualize the similarities further on a 2-d plot, we used dimensionality reduction by t-sne on these normalized association proﬁles for all genome-wide variants, and kmeans for clustering. This method only provides a global overview of the primary effects among variants. Mendelian Randomization Lead variants associated at P < 5 3 10À8 were used as instrumental variables in the MR. Enrichment of low P values (P < 0.05) among variants was calculated using a binomial distribution. Mendelian randomization analyses included the inverse-variance-weighted ﬁxed-effects, random-effects metaanalyses and weighted median. Heterogeneity was assessed through I2 index and Cochran’s Q. Pleiotropy analyses included the MR-Egger intercept, MR-RAPS and MR-LASSO estimates(Slob and Burgess, 2019). MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO)(Verbanck et al., 2018) was used as MR analysis to detect and remove pleiotropic variants. MR-PRESSO accounts for pleiotropic effects of the genetic variants comparing the observed distance of all the variants to the regression line (residual sum of squares) to the expected distance under the null hypothesis of no horizontal pleiotropy. MR-PRESSO is based on the assumption that at least 50% of the variants are valid instruments.
For the Mendelian randomization of dilated cardiomyopathy, variant effects on the ECG morphology at -18 ms were estimated using only individuals without a history of cardiac disease. We performed an additional analysis to explore the impact of pleiotropic signals by conducting a 2-stage Mendelian randomization using a discovery and replication stage. First, we assessed the causal relationship in UK Biobank and identiﬁed pleiotropic outliers by MR-PRESSO. Secondly, we replicated this analysis by repeating the MR in an independent cohort of 631 dilated cardiomyopathy patients from MAGNet. In this second stage, we excluded the variants identiﬁed by MR-PRESSO in the ﬁrst stage, hence correcting for pleiotropic effects in an unbiased manner.

Editorial decision letter with reviewers’ comments, first round of review
Dear Dr. Verweij,
I hope this email finds you well. The reviews are back on your manuscript and I’ve appended them below. You’ll see that the reviewers find the manuscript compelling and their comments are intended to strengthen an already strong piece of work. We’re happy to invite a revision. We appreciate that the COVID-19 pandemic challenges and limits what you and your lab can do, so if you have concerns about the feasibility of revisions, let's schedule a Zoom call at our earliest mutual convenience.
When you read the reviewers' comments, you'll see that the reviewers have essentially no concerns about the work's technical validity, but rather many points of curiosity and suggestions for extended your analysis. They are all very excellent, but we appreciate that following all of the reviewers suggestions is likely beyond the scope of the revision. Accordingly, I've made a few notes directly on the reviews and highlighted the points where I suggest that you focus your effort. In addition, because this study is such an excellent example of a general problem -- how to use GWAS to investigate a complex, continuous quantitative trait -- it would be excellent to include a workflow/teaching/summary figure as part of Figure 1 that summarizes your entire approach.
If you have any questions or concerns about the revision, I'd be happy to talk about them, either over email or by phone. More technical information and advice about resubmission can be found below my signature. Please read it carefully, as it can save substantial time and effort later.
I look forward to seeing your revised manuscript.
All the best, Quincey

Reviewers' comments:
Reviewer #1: Overall: Verweij and colleagues provide a very comprehensive dissection of ECG voltages across 500 discrete time points and evaluate the genetic basis of each time point among 63,706 individuals in the UK Biobank. They identify several new gene regions and provide a very comprehensive analysis. Further mechanistic (major #2) and clinical insights (major #3-4) from the several new observations would be helpful. Overall, the analyses were of high quality and the manuscript is well-written.
Major:

1. The authors show that variants are often associated with multiple datapoints. Since ECG regions correlated with cardiovascular prognosis (PR, QRS, ST, QT, etc) span multiple datapoints across the ECG, did the authors consider ECG-based electrically active datapoints across ECG segments?
2. Are there new mechanistic insights gleaned from the DEPICT analyses? Would the same gene sets emerge from prior ECG-based analyses? Are there new gene sets identified that provide additional insights into cardiomyocyte electrical activation?
3. The analysis of Q-R slope at -18s is quite interesting. I think this could be enriched if there are more granular analyses of how this datapoint could be used for DCM prognostication.
4. Could there be an unbiased approach to find other datapoints that may have more significant impact on DCM or sudden cardiac death risk than this specific datapoint which was prioritized based just on one variant? This could be informed by incorporating prior GWAS summary statistics for these conditions. [From QJ: Addressing this point would increase the impact of your work dramatically. It's unclear to me, though, how much work this comment represents if it is done at a very high standard. If addressing this point would be an entire study in-and-of itself, please reserve this for future work but discuss the possibility it raises in the Discussion.]
5. The discussion regarding drug safety seems unrelated to the present work. I don't see a direct evaluation of pharmacogenetics or drug risk. Known drug-related genes that influence EKG features and cardiovascular disease risk are described as being associated in the present work. I'm not sure whether there is an additional insight here.
Minor:
1. The peak signal for the QRS duration appears to full include the PR interval. Does this persist if you exclude indivuals without overt bundle branch blocks?
2. X- and y-axes for the correlation plot need to be added for Fig 2c.
3. Legend for Fig 5 is missing.
4. "Of all 331 ECG associated regions, 127 were shared (1MB region-based) with loci found in prior GWASes of classical ECG traits; 64 regions were shared with the atrial fibrillation phenotype. We identified 179 genetic association signals that had not been reported before." Does the 179 refer to independent SNPs associated with ECG regions that are not in LD with prior lead SNPs? This doesn't appear to be loci (331 - 127 - 64 = 140). Did the authors consider non-lead SNPs in prior GWAS that were previously significant and potentially in LD with the "179" signals?
5. Please clarify whether all ECGs included were in sinus rhythm.

Reviewer #2: Review of Verweij et al, The genetic makeup of the electrocardiogram
This paper represents a unique approach to applying the genome-wide association study (GWAS) paradigm to a complex, continuous quantitative trait. By studying each point along the electrocardiogram (ECG) trace the authors identify unique genetic contributions at different time points, implicating different pathways and genes involved in depolarization and repolarization. This is summarized nicely in figure 3b which I really consider the centerpiece and high point of the whole paper.
As a suggestion, I think it would strengthen the paper if the authors built out from this classification, for example by picking an "exemplar gene" in each of the 5 clusters that exemplifies the themes or pathways identified in that cluster. The exemplar gene could be one of the DEPICT-identified genes in that cluster. This might help connect the many genes mentioned throughout the text and their relationships to the identified clusters and the key pathways contributing to the physiology at that point of the ECG cycle. [From QJ: this is a constructive suggestion. I also found Fig. 3D and E too difficult to read/parse to have those figures be as informative as they should be. I suggest that you follow this suggestion, move Fig. 3D to the Supplement and include a legible supplemental table that replaces Fig. 3E.]
The authors should also consider annotating loci by proximity to known rare genetic cardiac disease genes, for example those collected by Orphanet (code ORPHA:97929). I think this will help identify likely causal genes at a large number of loci beyond their current analyses. The creation of the public http://www.ecgenetics.org/ website for interacting with the data is a very nice addition and does set a standard for making this kind of data more accessible to a broader audience.
A few additional concerns and corrections: I do not find Fig 3d (the hairball figure) to be informative and I would recommend omitting it.
In the introduction, "arrythmia's" should be "arrythmias".
Page 8: "We found that that these 10" has too many "that's"
Study limitations: "…this will be particularly relevant…" should be the start of a new sentence ECG morphology phenotypes and quality control: "CSL STYLE ERROR" - Zotero error?
Candidate genes: "Wang & Goldstein (2018)" is now published.

Editorial decision letter with reviewers’ comments, second round of review
< Dear Niek,
Thanks very much for your patience! I'm very pleased to let you know that the reviews of your revised manuscript are back, the peer-review process is complete, and only a few minor, editoriallyguided changes are needed to move forward towards publication.
In addition to the final comments from the reviewers, I’ve made some suggestions about your manuscript within the “Editorial Notes” section, below. Please consider my editorial suggestions carefully, ask any questions of me that you need, make all warranted changes, and then upload your final files into Editorial Manager. We hope to receive your files within 10 business days, but we recognize that the COVID19 pandemic may challenge and limit what you can do. Please email me directly if this timing is a problem or you're facing extenuating circumstances.
I'm looking forward to going through these last steps with you. More technical information can be found below my signature, and please let me know if you have any questions.
All the best, Quincey

Editorial Notes
Title: Your title is excellent, but I always ask authors to make sure their titles are as effective as they can be. Note that an effective title is easily found on Pubmed and Google. A trick for thinking about titles is this: ask yourself, "How would I structure a Pubmed search to find this paper?" Put that search together and see whether it comes up is good "sister literature" for this work. If it does, feature the search terms in your title.
Abstract: I’ve gone over your abstract with the goals of increasing accessibility to a broad audience and making it more concrete. See what you think. Please feel free to revert anything that you don’t like or that you feel distorts your meaning! I apologize if there are instances of the latter.
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most useful non-invasive diagnostic tests for a wide array of cardiac disorders; traditional approaches to analyzing ECGs focus on individual segments. Here, we performed comprehensive deep phenotyping of 77,190 ECGs in the UK Biobank across the complete cycle of cardiac conduction, resulting in 500 spatial-temporal datapoints, across XXX

<insert number> genetic variants. In addition to calculating polygenic risk scores for the traditional ECG segments, we identified over 300 genetic loci that are statistically associated with aberrant high-dimensional ECG morphologies defined by our deep phenotyping. We defined the ECG signature for dilated cardiomyopathy, associated the BAG3, HSPB7/CLCNKA, PRKCA, TMEM43, and OSCN loci with disease risk, and confirmed this association in an independent cohort. In total, our work demonstrates that high-dimensional analysis of the entire ECG provides unique opportunities for studying cardiac biology, disease and furthering drug development. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.
Manuscript Text: I've gone over your manuscript text carefully and made specific notes below. They relate to portions of the text that are called out on a PDF that I've marked up and will send you in a separate email. Please take these suggestions very seriously and let me know if you would like to talk about them over Zoom. Not addressing these points will dramatically limit the scientific impact and readership of your manuscript, which would be very unfortunate! Your manuscript deserves to be widely read and appreciated.
Introduction
Note 1: Several sentences need to be inserted to take your reader through your approach a very high level so that they can understand how your approach differs from the standard. Specifically: what is a morphological ECG signature? This needs to be explicitly defined. Your reader needs to understand, at a high level, how you’re extracting morphological ECG signatures from the patient data. It’s very important to be specific here and make sure your language and your figures aren’t inadvertently misleading. For example, Figure 1 makes it seem like you’re not integrating information across the entire ECG. Instead, it seems like you’re just saying, for each trace “log QT Y/N” (or similar). That’s not correct! Figure 1 needs to be expanded to include more steps and more salient details, and then the introductory text should walk through that revised Figure. In aggregate, your reader needs to better understand -- with the aid of your text and explanatory figure -- what you mean by "deep phenotyping." When you're revising Figure 1, make sure you include an example ECG that has the traditionally defined sections (e.g. QT interval) clearly labeled.
Note 2: As written, this is non-specific and unclear. Just as “morphological ECG signature” needs to be defined, “genetic ECG signature” needs to be defined. Also, are you referring to Figure 4?
Results:
Note 1: Indicate that this secondary analysis is designated as “RR” in figure panels and then call them out (e.g. Fig. 3C).

Note 2: My basic thoughts when reading this paragraph of your Results was this: there is SO VERY MUCH work here and WAY TOO LITTLE of it is represented. That will hurt the impact of your paper, and none of us want that! For example, it is not clear that Supplemental Data 1 and 2 are absolutely massive and sit under Figures 2 and 3, in the sense that each panel in Fig. 2 & 3 is an aggregate of all of those data/all of that analysis. Accordingly:
1. Figure 2 needs to be re-worked dramatically to illustrate these relationships. Specifically, choose one trait (e.g. Atrial Fibrilation – an obviously interesting one) and present it as you do in Data S1: panels A, B, C, D, E, and the average (which is currently the panel shown in Fig. 2?). Fill the remaining portion of the page with at least 3 examples of interesting SNPS from Data S2. In the text, say that while you’ve presented this for one trait, you’ve conducted the same analysis on 8 traits and <number> of alleles and that all of the analysis is available on Mendeley.
2. The portion of the text describing Figure 3 needs to be its own paragraph. Within that paragraph: o The boxed alleles in panel A need to be listed, named, and introduced (see note 3 below). o The R-R normalization needs to be called out explicitly, along with why it’s important to do (what does it show?). o Heritability needs to be defined in this context because you’re using it in a field-specific way and you can’t assume that a general audience will have the same definition. After you define it, explain: A) why it’s important to characterize in this way, B) what the clinical implications are of a trait being more-vs-less heritable, and C) why it’s important to relate heritability to electrical activity.
Note 3: All of the genes highlighted in green need to be described in a manner similar to your description of Obscurin (top of p. 8), also highlighted in green, but please also include the biochemical function of the gene product in question. For example, it should be noted that Obscurin is a ~720 kDa multidomain protein in the Titan family.
Note 4: Dilated cardiomyopathy needs to be introduced as a specific disease (e.g. what makes it present clinically as severe?). Importantly, one shouldn’t have to wait until the Discussion to know that 50% of diagnosed patients are dead within 5 years (but many asymptomatic)! That information needs to be provided here, and I suggest moving text from the Discussion (see note Discussion Note 2, below) up into this section, editing it as necessary. Finally, please spell out dilated cardiomyopathy throughout the text.
Note 5: The way this section is written is very confusing: there is a good deal of emphasis on “new” and yet there is also clear referencing of previous literature. This text needs to be clear about what your analysis adds to extant literature, even if it’s confirming what’s been previously predicted/associated, and what what was previously known. Please edit for clarity. Importantly, when you are editing, note that we disallow the use of “new,” “novel,” and other priority claims (see below). Avoid these descriptions.

Note 6: The logic isn’t crystal clear here. Why is the lack of diagnosis important? Why is it indicative of a biomarker? Be explicit. I’m guessing it has to do with the following: 50% dead in 5 years but many asymptomatic.
Discussion:
Note 1: Cell Systems favors slim discussions. Please delete text that’s been struck-through and move the last sentences up to the end of the previous paragraph. Delete subsequent struckthrough sections as well.
Note 2: Please move this section of text, editing as necessary, into the Results as indicated above.
Also, as you make your text edits, please note that:
• House style disallows editorializing within the text (e.g. strikingly, surprisingly, importantly, etc.), especially the Results section. These terms are a distraction and they aren't needed—your excellent observations are certainly impactful enough to stand on their own. Please remove these words and others like them. “Notably” is suitably neutral to use once or twice if absolutely necessary.
• As noted above, we don’t allow “priority claims” (e.g. new, novel, etc.). For a discussion of why, read: http://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/getting-priorities-right-with-novelty-claims, http://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/novel-insights-into-priority-claims.
Figures and Legends: As mentioned above, figures 1 and 2 need to be re-worked:
• Figure 1 needs to include more steps to make it clear how the deep phenotyping works. It also needs to include an example ECG with all major sections labeled. Please note that you can take an entire page!
• For Figure 2 (verbatim from above): choose one trait (e.g. Atrial Fibrilation – an obviously interesting one) and present it as you do in Data S1: panels A, B, C, D, E, and the average (which is currently the panel shown in Fig. 2?). Fill the remaining portion of the page with at least 3 examples of interesting SNPS from Data S2.
Also, your Figure Legends are too sparse and contain missing information. They need to provide all of the information necessary to interpret the figures they describe, without help from the main text. Please revise your Figure Legends to make them fulsome and complete; if you are worried about text length limits, please email me.
Thank you!

Reviewer comments:
Reviewer #2: I thank the authors for their thoughtful responses to the reviewer comments from me and the other reviewer.
I really like the new figure 4C and I think it adds a lot to the overall impact and presentation of the paper. The interactive tSNE plot on the website is another nice addition.
I just have 3 minor comments:
1) the region near SCN5A is sometimes called the SCN5A locus and sometimes the SCN5A/SCN10A locus. Either is fine, but should be consistent.
2) in the discussion, the sentence "an integrative conditional analysis of the SCN5A/SCN10A taking into" needs the word "locus"
3) in the introduction, the sentence "...ECG identified more than hundred genetic loci..." should say "more than one hundred genetic loci"
I think this paper will be a nice contribution to the field and encourage its rapid publication

Response to Reviewers
Dear Reviewers,
Thank you for the thorough evaluation of our manuscript, the constructive and helpful comments and compliments on our work. In response to dr. Justman comments, we included a figure on our approach and workflow as Figure . We believe that your comments have helped us to improve our manuscript, and hope that the implemented changes meet your requests and that our manuscript may now be acceptable for publication.
Best wishes,
Niek on behalf of the authors
Point-by-point response
Reviewer #1 Overall: Verweij and colleagues provide a very comprehensive dissection of ECG voltages across 500 discrete time points and evaluate the genetic basis of each time point among 63,706 individuals in the UK Biobank. They identify several new gene regions and provide a very comprehensive analysis. Further mechanistic (major #2) and clinical insights (major #3-4) from the several new observations would be helpful. Overall, the analyses were of high quality and the manuscript is well-written.
Reponse: We thank the reviewer for his positive comments on our manuscript.
Major: 1. The authors show that variants are often associated with multiple datapoints. Since ECG regions correlated with cardiovascular prognosis (PR, QRS, ST, QT, etc) span multiple datapoints across the ECG, did the authors consider ECG-based electrically active datapoints across ECG segments?
Reponse: There are indeed ways to combine information (e.g. individual level data points or summary statistics) across ECG segments. For example, there are different methods for multi-phenotype GWAS, but there are also other ways to decompose the electrocardiogram’ and that way combine active datapoints across the ECG. These types of analyses may provide more power for specific problems or areas of interest, but would likely come at the cost of interpretability and visualization of effects– which was one of our key aims with the current study. We believe there are many ways to take this further and hope that the current work will inspire others to think about how to analyze the ECG while upholding the high dimensional nature of the data.
2. Are there new mechanistic insights gleaned from the DEPICT analyses? Would the same gene sets emerge from prior ECG-based analyses? Are there new gene sets identified that provide additional insights into cardiomyocyte electrical activation?
Reponse: Many of the DEPICT pathways overlap with those found in earlier ECG GWASes (Verweij in Human Molecular Genetics 2016, Eppinga et al in Nature genetics 2016, van der Harst in JACC 2015, Ntalla et al in Biorxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/712398). One important limitation of pathway analyses for GWAS in general is that they are traditionally performed on a single phenotype. And since ECG traits share a lot of the genetics, it is not surprising that previous DEPICT analyses of different ECG traits found the same or very similar pathways. With this study we hoped to contribute to a pathway approach that leverages information across traits and provide new mechanistic insights by means of differential pathway analyses. This hasn’t been explored or performed before for any GWAS (as far as we know). Using this approach it is quite clear that that structural heart terms are significantly more enriched with the QR wave compared to other parts of the ECG; which adds credibility to our finding that QR wave is relevant for DCM.

Unfortunately, we believe we can’t interpret the DEPICT pathway analyses to the point that we can say whether the identification of ‘new’ pathways (i.e. not highlighted in previous GWASes) provides additional insights. This is because pathways are also correlated with each other by sharing genes. So, without accounting for overlap in pathways, more power (more input genes) will automatically increase your chance to finding more enriched pathways; this requires new method development in this area.
3. The analysis of Q-R slope at -18s is quite interesting. I think this could be enriched if there are more granular analyses of how this datapoint could be used for DCM prognostication.
Reponse: We were also very excited to see a new clinical relationship with the ECG and agree with the reviewer that amplitudes at -18s will need more granular analyses to understand it further. We believe that this will be a substantial piece of work to fully understand, potentially involving other collaborators and data, going beyond the current manuscript deserving a separate study that could be targeted to a (clinical) audience in cardiology.
We discuss future steps in the discussion:
“Further studies should focus on in-depth characterization of how this ECG signature for DCM can be used in precision medicine approaches (Rosenbaum et al., 2019), used as a biomarker, used for stratification, or used to monitor progression.”
4. Could there be an unbiased approach to find other datapoints that may have more significant impact on DCM or sudden cardiac death risk than this specific datapoint which was prioritized based just on one variant? This could be informed by incorporating prior GWAS summary statistics for these conditions. [From QJ: Addressing this point would increase the impact of your work dramatically. It's unclear to me, though, how much work this comment represents if it is done at a very high standard. If addressing this point would be an entire study in-and-of itself, please reserve this for future work but discuss the possibility it raises in the Discussion.]
Reponse: Thank you very much for raising this, this is a great point. The relationship between ECG amplitudes at +44ms and ER was based only variant indeed, because there aren’t any more loci robustly identified. The relationship between amplitudes at -18ms and DCM was based on 2 variants. Here too, these were coincidentally the only 2 robustly associated DCM GWAS loci at the time that this study was performed. As the reviewer suggests, it would indeed be possible to identify such relationships using an unbiased approach by incorporating GWAS statistics of diseases with the ECG. However, taking such approach will also drive the multiple testing burden up, and depending on the technique you take (shared heritability, Mendelian randomization, polygenic scores), the power may be limited. This was one of the main reasons for us to go with a more hypothesis driven approach first.
However, since the relationship between the -18ms point of the ECG and DCM is so strong, we realized that we could carry out an ECG-wide Mendelian randomization for DCM. This confirmed that -18ms was most associated with DCM. We believe this method would constitute an unbiased approach and is able to reveal an ‘ECG-signature’ for DCM. It seems there is a secondary effect just before the QR wave as well. We have included the following sections;
In the results:
“We carried out an ECG-wide Mendelian randomization (fixed effects inverse variance weighted method) in UK Biobank to reveal the ECG signature for DCM. This analysis confirmed that -18ms was most associated with DCM but also revealed a secondary effect just before the QR wave (Figure 5a).“
In the discussion:

“By performing an ECG-wide Mendelian randomization analysis we obtained an unbiased ECG signature for DCM. Further studies should focus on in-depth characterization of how this signature can be used in precision medicine approaches (Rosenbaum et al., 2019), used as a biomarker, used for stratification, or used to monitor progression of DCM.”
The following Figure was incorporated in Figure 5a (previously Figure 4a):

5. The discussion regarding drug safety seems unrelated to the present work. I don't see a direct evaluation of pharmacogenetics or drug risk. Known drug-related genes that influence EKG features and cardiovascular disease risk are described as being associated in the present work. I'm not sure whether there is an additional insight here.

Reponse: We agree with the reviewer that our data does not shed new light on pharmacogenetics or drug evaluation as is. But we believe our data provides a new data resource for genetic validation of potential drug targets and studying their effects on cardiac conduction. We condensed this section in the current version and removed Figure 5.

Minor 1. The peak signal for the QRS duration appears to full include the PR interval. Does this persist if you exclude individuals without overt bundle branch blocks?

Reponse: Yes, this persisted when excluding individuals with a history of bundle branch block. We performed sensitivity analyses, where we excluded individuals with a history of bundle-branch-block or other cardiac disease including myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or pacemaker implantation. Results for QRS duration are shown below (and incorporated in Online Data 1 http://tiny.cc/verweij). Across the board, there seems to be no difference between including and excluding individuals with cardiac disease including bundle branch block.

Online Data 1, panel QRS duration:

Primary analysis

Sensitivity analysis (excl individuals with history of cardiac disease incl bundle branch block)

This suggests that increased QRS duration is associated with a shift in the P-wave (similar to the PR-interval signature). To understand this further, it is worth taking a look at the heatmap of QRS duration depicted here on the right (and in Online Data 1). We find that some variant’s main and secondary effect is on PR interval, such as SCN5A/SCN10A, CASQ1, EXOG and CAV1. Especially, the SCN10A variants appears to have an extreme association at the P wave (P<E-125), suggesting these variants drive the PR-interval prolongation observed in the polygenic score of QRS duration, which may be biologically plausible.

Minor 2. X- and y-axes for the correlation plot need to be added for Fig 2c. Minor 3. Legend for Fig 5 is missing.
Reponse: We clarified the axes of 2c. Fig 5 is now omitted.
Minor 4. "Of all 331 ECG associated regions, 127 were shared (1MB region-based) with loci found in prior GWASes of classical ECG traits; 64 regions were shared with the atrial fibrillation phenotype. We identified 179 genetic association signals that had not been reported before." Does the 179 refer to independent SNPs associated with ECG regions that are not in LD with prior lead SNPs? This doesn't appear to be loci (331 - 127 - 64 = 140). Did the authors consider non-lead SNPs in prior GWAS that were previously significant and potentially in LD with the "179" signals?
Reponse: ‘179’ refers to the number of 1MB regions around the lead SNP, we did not consider non-lead SNPs for this count. The number is explained by the fact that 39 loci are also shared between atrial fibrillation and classical ECG traits (140 + 39 = 179), this information is available in Table S1, column AB and AC, column V indicates if it is a lead SNP.
Minor 5. Please clarify whether all ECGs included were in sinus rhythm.
Reponse: Our aim was to only include ECGs in sinus rhythm. To this end we performed QC on individual level and population level separately. First to retain only normal ECG beats by comparing each individual beat to the average beat of an individual, removing any abnormal beats and noise. And secondly, we performed QC on the population level by comparing each individual’s ECG to the population average. In particular, the population QC was clearly able to identify abnormal ECGs as they were highly enriched for cardiac disorders:
“The excluded individuals based on population level QC were much more likely to be diagnosed with a history of bundle branch block (OR=16.8, se= 3.1, z=15.41), cardiomyopathy (OR=8.8 se=2.3, z=8.58), myocardial infarction (OR=2.9, se=0.27, z=12.2), atrial fibrillation (OR=2.0, se=0.25, z=5.6), and heart failure (OR=7.3, se=1.2,z=12.55).”
Because there are limitations in the way we determine perfect sinus rhythm, e.g. the 3-lead ECGs offers only limited information compared to 12 leads for example, we also excluded individuals with history of any cardiac disease and re-ran the analyses as sensitivity analyses (available in the supplementary data).

Reviewer #2 This paper represents a unique approach to applying the genome-wide association study (GWAS) paradigm to a complex, continuous quantitative trait. By studying each point along the electrocardiogram (ECG) trace the authors identify unique genetic contributions at different time points, implicating different pathways and genes involved in depolarization and repolarization. This is summarized nicely in figure 3b which I really consider the centerpiece and high point of the whole paper.
Reponse: We thank the reviewer for the overall positive assessment of the current work. We have now added an interactive t-SNE plot (figure 3b, now figure 4b) to www.ecgenetics.org.
As a suggestion, I think it would strengthen the paper if the authors built out from this classification, for example by picking an "exemplar gene" in each of the 5 clusters that exemplifies the themes or pathways identified in that cluster. The exemplar gene could be one of the DEPICT-identified genes in that cluster. This might help connect the many genes mentioned throughout the text and their relationships to the identified clusters and the key pathways contributing to the physiology at that point of the ECG cycle. [From QJ: this is a constructive suggestion. I also found Fig. 3D and E too difficult to read/parse to have those figures be as informative as they should be.

Reponse: We agree with the reviewer and removed fig 3d and 3e. The information of Fig. D and E is now better described/referred in Table S1 (summarizing which SNP belongs to which cluster) and Table S5 (summarizing which pathways belong to which clusters).
We also replaced panel C (now Figure 4C) with a figure that shows examples for each cluster and added extra annotation of each process (e.g. ventricular depolarization, ventricular repolarization) for clarification. We annotated it with the most likely gene, and were mindful of the ones already in the figure or manuscript. Anyone familiar with cardiac physiology should be familiar with genes in panel C.
The authors should also consider annotating loci by proximity to known rare genetic cardiac disease genes, for example those collected by Orphanet (code ORPHA:97929). I think this will help identify likely causal genes at a large number of loci beyond their current analyses.
Reponse: Of 197 unique cardiac genes (excluding mitochondrial genes) found through Orphanet, 58 (29.4%) were within 250kb of the sentinel SNP. We included the Orphanet annotations in Table S1. This helped us to gain confidence in some genes and prioritize new candidate genes, like the reviewer suggested. For example, we were excited to see that rs4685090 is now annotated withTMEM43 (through ‘Familial isolated arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia’), which we previously missed. Other interesting new genes that could explain some of the signals are CACNA1D (Sinoatrial node dysfunction), MIB2 (Left ventricular noncompaction), ANK2 (Romano-Ward syndrome) and DTNA (Left ventricular noncompaction).
We want to thank the reviewer very much for this suggestion as it added many relevant genes and disease annotations.
The creation of the public http://www.ecgenetics.org/ website for interacting with the data is a very nice addition and does set a standard for making this kind of data more accessible to a broader audience.
Reponse: We thank the reviewer for the kind compliment.
A few additional concerns and corrections: I do not find Fig 3d (the hairball figure) to be informative and I would recommend omitting it. In the introduction, "arrythmia's" should be "arrythmias". Page 8: "We found that that these 10" has too many "that's" Study limitations: "…this will be particularly relevant…" should be the start of a new sentence

ECG morphology phenotypes and quality control: "CSL STYLE ERROR" - Zotero error? Candidate genes: "Wang & Goldstein (2018)" is now published.
Reponse: Thanks very much for these suggestions, we agree and have omitted figure 3d and changed everything else accordingly.
