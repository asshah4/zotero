Inﬁltrative Cardiovascular Diseases
Cardiomyopathies That Look Alike
James B. Seward, MD,* Grace Casaclang-Verzosa, MD† Rochester, Minnesota
Inﬁltrative cardiomyopathies are characterized by the deposition of abnormal substances that cause the ventricular walls to become progressively rigid, thereby impeding ventricular ﬁlling. Some inﬁltrative cardiac diseases increase ventricular wall thickness, while others cause chamber enlargement with secondary wall thinning. Increased wall thickness, small ventricular volume, and occasional dynamic left ventricular outﬂow obstruction (e.g., amyloidosis) can outwardly appear similar to conditions with true myocyte hypertrophy (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease). Likewise, inﬁltrative disease that presents with a dilated left ventricle with global or regional wall motion abnormalities and aneurysm formation (e.g., sarcoidosis) may mimic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Low-voltage QRS complex was the sine qua non of inﬁltrative cardiomyopathy (i.e., cardiac amyloid). However, low-voltage QRS complex is not a uniform ﬁnding with the inﬁltrative cardiomyopathies. The clinical presentation, along with functional and morphologic features, often provides enough insight to establish a working diagnosis. In most circumstances, however, tissue or serologic evaluation is needed to validate or clarify the cardiac diagnosis and institute appropriate therapy.

Inﬁltrative cardiomyopathies are characterized by the deposition of abnormal substances that cause the ventricular walls to become progressively rigid, thereby impeding ventricular ﬁlling. Some inﬁltrative cardiac diseases increase ventricular wall thickness (Table 1), while others cause chamber enlargement with secondary wall thinning (Table 2). The clinical presentation, along with functional and morphologic features, often provides enough insight to establish a working diagnosis. However, in most circumstances, tissue or serologic evaluation is needed to validate or clarify the cardiac diagnosis and institute appropriate therapy. This report highlights the unique features of the various inﬁltrative cardiac diseases, which may have similar features.
Inﬁltrative Heart Disease
General considerations. CARDIAC FUNCTION ASSESSMENT. Inﬁltrative diseases of the heart are generally characterized by progressive diastolic dysfunction, which typically precedes the development of overt systolic dysfunction. Although increased myocardial mass is characteristic of most inﬁltrative diseases, the quantiﬁcation of mass is usually not a major determinant of survival. Doppler echocardiography has simpliﬁed the assessment of diastolic physiology and

atrial remodeling, which are hallmarks of the restrictive disease process. The chronicity of diastolic dysfunction is best characterized by depressed Doppler myocardial relaxation velocity (mitral annular E tissue velocity) and increased left atrial volume index (1). Systolic dysfunction is commonly measured as a decrease in the ejection fraction or systolic tissue Doppler velocity (2).
The role of computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in providing incremental information for risk assessment in inﬁltrative cardiomyopathies has not been adequately established. However, cardiac structure, function, and tissue characteristics can be obtained by CMR LGE. Gadolinium causes magnetic hyperenhancement in conditions in which extracellular space is expanded (i.e., myocyte necrosis, myocardial edema, scar formation, and protein inﬁltration) (3,4). CMR has been used to characterize the type of inﬁltrative disease by the location and distribution of LGE and enable the evaluation of disease activity and response to therapy. The sensitivity of CMR in patients with early disease who do not have abnormal ﬁndings on echocardiography is unknown. However, screening of subclinical early cardiac involvement may become possible should CMR LGE prove to have adequate sensitivity in detecting amyloid inﬁltration. The abnormalities in myocardial and blood pool kinetics hold the promise of serial quantiﬁcation of cardiac amyloid load and treatment follow-up. Electrophysiologic considerations. It is important to emphasize that wall thickness is not necessarily a reliable

of abnormal substances within myocytes or the myocardial interstitium, may cause increased wall thickness without actual myocyte hypertrophy. Consequently, increased wall thickness does not consistently correlate with an increase in QRS complex amplitude. In fact, QRS complex amplitude

can become decreased (low volt-

age), a phenomenon more commonly observed with accumu-

lations within the interstitium than within myocytes. The

absence of increased voltage on the electrocardiogram (ECG)

despite the appearance of “hypertrophy” can be the ﬁrst clue to

certain inﬁltrative diseases (e.g., cardiac amyloid, Friedreich

ataxia). However, low-voltage QRS complex is not a uniform

ﬁnding with the inﬁltrative cardiomyopathies. Some inﬁltrative

myopathies have increased voltage (e.g., Danon and Fabry

diseases), which will be seen when there is an increase in the

size of cardiac myocytes, normal intraventricular conduction,

and synchronous activation occurring globally in the myocar-

dium (Table 1).

Genetic testing. The role of genetic testing in differenti-

ating phenocopies of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is

evident when clinical or imaging data are inconclusive.

Genetic testing is now available on a clinical basis for several

of the genes responsible for cardiomyopathies. However, it

has its limitations and challenges. Testing sensitivity is low,

and there may be more than 1 genetic variant in an affected

patient or within a single family. Other challenges of genetic

evaluation, especially in children, include age-dependent

penetrance, the management of asymptomatic children, the

psychological effects of testing asymptomatic minors, and

expense (5,6).

General management. Most inﬁltrative diseases have until

recently been considered irreversible, and supportive mea-

sures were the only available means of management. Gen-

eral management consists of improving diastolic function

with angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-

converting enzyme inhibitors. Beta-blockers and statins,

which are known to be useful for heart failure management,

may be of beneﬁt. Systolic hypertension and overt ﬂuid

overload can justify the cautious use of thiazide diuretics.

Excessive or protracted diuresis (i.e., using loop diuretics)

should be avoided in the presence of hypovolemia and small,

noncompliant ventricular cavities. Novel treatment modal-

ities will be brieﬂy discussed when applicable.

Inﬁltrative Cardiomyopathies That Look Like Hypertrophic or Hypertensive Heart Disease
Cardiac amyloid. Cardiac amyloid is the prototype of inﬁltrative heart disease with increased wall thickness (Fig. 1). Cardiac involvement is common in all forms of amyloidosis

and is the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality (7). Symptoms include heart failure (i.e., breathlessness and exercise intolerance), arrhythmias, conduction block, dynamic ventricular outﬂow obstruction, and hypotension.
Characteristic echocardiographic appearance of cardiac amyloid includes increased thickness of both LV and right ventricular walls, normal or small LV cavity size, and a nonspeciﬁc granular appearance of the myocardium (Fig. 2). Atrial enlargement, thickened papillary muscles, and valve leaﬂets and small to moderate pericardial effusion are also commonly present. LV compliance gradually decreases as myocardial deposition of amyloid ﬁbrils progresses (8). Progressive diastolic dysfunction is a universal ﬁnding (8). Systolic dysfunction is typically evident only in advanced stages (9). Doppler echocardiography is used to establish and serially monitor the magnitude of diastolic and systolic dysfunction. CMR will show diffuse LGE throughout both ventricles, particularly the subendocardium (3).
Despite increased ventricular wall thickness, 30% to 50% of patients with demonstrable amyloid disease will have normal-voltage QRS complexes, and the remainder show low-voltage complexes. A pseudoinfarction pattern, particularly in the inferoseptal wall, may be observed in the precordial leads (10). A decrease in QRS complex amplitude occurs because of myocyte atrophy along with decreased conduction velocity and dyssynchronous activation resulting from amyloid deposition (11,12).
Cardiac amyloidosis is diagnosed either directly by endomyocardial biopsy or indirectly using noninvasive diagnostic tools (2-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ECG) and histologic conﬁrmation of amyloid on a noncardiac tissue specimen. Upon unequivocal establishment of the diagnosis and tissue conﬁrmation of amyloid type, prompt therapy is warranted for primary amyloidosis to arrest or reverse cardiac dysfunction (Fig. 3). Poor cardiac reserve severely narrows the management strategies in the late stages (7,13). Untreated patients have a median survival of Ͻ6 months after the onset of heart failure (13). Melphalan, steroids, immunomodulating agents, and stem cell transplantation after chemotherapy yield promising results (14 –17). However, the mortality rate of transplantation ranges from 11% to 40% (18,19). In some patients with advanced cardiac involvement, cardiac transplantation may be performed before stem cell transplantation (20,21). Fabry disease. Fabry disease is an X-linked autosomal recessive disease due to a lack of lysosomal enzyme, ␣-galactosidase A, which breaks down neutral glycosphingolipids (22). This causes intracellular lysosomal accumulation of ceramide trihexoside (globotriaosylceramide), primarily in the skin, kidneys, and heart (22). Men are commonly affected, with the condition diagnosed early in childhood, but cardiac involvement is not manifested until the third or fourth decade of life (23). Cardiac involvement in Fabry disease can mimic the morphologic and clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM; very thick walls, systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral valve

leaﬂet) and accounts for 3% of cases initially diagnosed as HCM (24,25). However, asymmetrical hypertrophy causing severe LV outﬂow tract obstruction and signiﬁcant mitral insufﬁciency are typically absent in Fabry disease (26). LV wall thickness and LV mass increase as age and the severity of disease advance (22). Ejection fraction and fractional shortening are usually preserved (22). Progressive diastolic dysfunction is evident, but restrictive ﬁlling pattern is an infrequent ﬁnding (22). On 2-dimensional echocardiography, nonspeciﬁc binary appearance of the endocardial border corresponding to endomyocardial sphingolipid compartmentalization, creating a 2-layered appearance of the myocardium, has been observed (24,27). CMR will typically show focal inferolateral midwall LGE sparing the subendocardium (3,28). Progressive diastolic dysfunction best characterizes the prognosis.
Fabry disease is not associated with decreased QRS complex amplitude but rather shows ECG features of LV hypertrophy commensurate with the wall thickness (29). A pattern of pre-excitation can be seen (29). However, in some cases, when deposition occurs within the atrioventricular node, the PR interval may be prolonged (30).
Enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to reduce LV wall thickness and improve regional myocardial function, but its effect on survival has yet to be adequately determined (31). Danon disease. Like Fabry disease, Danon disease is a rare X-linked disorder due to primary deﬁciency of lysosomeassociated membrane protein 2 (32,33). It affects men at an early age (in the teens) and women in later years (in the 20s). Affected men typically present with a triad of heart failure, skeletal myopathy, and mental retardation (34). In female carriers, the disease predominantly affects the cardiac myocytes (35).
Cardiac symptoms begin during adolescence, and patients die of heart failure in their third decade (34). Echocardiographic characteristics include a marked symmetrical increase in LV wall thickness (range 20 to 60 mm), signiﬁcantly greater

than that typically found in patients with HCM (32). LV systolic dysfunction is often severely impaired (32,34). LV outlet obstruction is uncommon (34). A prominent increase in right ventricular wall thickness (Ն10 mm) in the absence of pulmonary disease may also be observed (32). Unlike HCM, in which LGE is midepicardial and patchy, Danon disease has subendocardial LGE (36).
Unlike amyloidosis, Danon disease is a myocyte disorder, not an interstitial one, and thus is associated with normal or increased QRS complex amplitude. In addition, conduction velocity (pre-excitation) may be enhanced (37,38). Unlike HCM, Danon disease and associated glycogen storage disorders (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 or protein kinase, adenosine monophosphate-activated, gamma 2 noncatalytic subunit mutations) are associated with true preexcitation and the presence of single or multiple accessory pathways (37,38). Short PR interval and delta waves (WolffParkinson-White syndrome) is a common ﬁnding causing syncope in most patients (34). Palpitations or documented arrhythmias in patients with this disorder may be related to the ventricular myopathic process (ventricular tachycardia) or the accessory pathway (orthodromic or antidromic precipitating tachycardia).
Genetic testing for lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 gene mutation is deﬁnitive and is the major diagnostic criterion in women (in whom the protein may be present because of 1 normal X chromosome) (34). There is no speciﬁc treatment for Danon disease (34). Potentially lifethreatening pre-excitation atrial ﬁbrillation or atrial ﬂutter with conduction through the accessory pathways should be treated by ablation or sodium-channel blockers. The value of cardiac transplantation has not been established, because very few patients live long enough (they die at very young ages) to undergo transplantation (35,39). The most common cause of death is severe heart failure (32,34). Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded GuanineAdenine-Adenine repeats (120 to 1,700 times, rather than the

usual 8 to 22) in the frataxin gene on chromosome 9 (40). The age at onset of symptoms ranges from 2 to 51 years (40). Generally, the cardiac manifestations occur 4 to 5 years after the onset of the neurologic disorders, but occasionally heart disease occurs ﬁrst (41). Cardiac disease eventually develops in 90% to 100% of patients (42).
Echocardiographic studies reveal differing patterns of increased wall thickness unrelated to the duration of the disease (43). Cardiac involvement is characterized by increased wall thickness of the interventricular septum or posterior wall (41,42,44) (Fig. 2). LV diastolic relaxation is reduced, but LV cavity size and ejection fraction are usually normal (42,44). Asymmetrical septal hypertrophy and LV outﬂow obstruction are rare (42,44). Severe heart failure can develop in some patients with mild LV dilation and systolic dysfunction (41). Valvular insufﬁciency, if present, is usually mild (42). Noncardiac dyspnea and frequent respiratory infections are due to

severe scoliosis and neuromuscular impairment of respiratory muscles (41). The 10-, 20-, and 30-year survival rates are 96%, 80%, and 61%, respectively (45). Cause of death is intercurrent pulmonary infection and cardiac dysfunction (12,41). At this time, the only known therapy is supportive. Investigational drugs include idebenone (a free radical scavenger) and deferiprone (an iron chelator) (46).
Compared with HCM, QRS complex voltage may not show the extent of LV hypertrophy (41,47). The reason for the lack of QRS complex ampliﬁcation is marked connective tissue replacement and slowing of intraventricular conduction (41,47). Coronary artery disease, abnormalities of the nerve and the ganglia, and changes in the myocytes predispose these patients to regions of slow conduction and the propensity for ventricular tachyarrhythmia (41,47).

production of oxalic acid, leading to the deposition of oxalate crystals in different organs, particularly the heart and the kidneys (48,49). Echocardiography demonstrates biventricular symmetrically thickened walls (49,50) (Fig. 2). Ejection fraction may be normal in the early stage of this disease (50). In advanced cases, mild biventricular dilation has been observed (50). In contrast to LV hypertrophy found in long-term dialysis patients, the myocardium in hyperoxaluria is characterized by patchy, echodense speckled reﬂection most prominent in the papillary muscles (50,51). In the very late stages, computed tomography can demonstrate oxalate deposits as increased attenuation of the myocardium (Fig. 4). Diastolic function is severely impaired, with elevated ﬁlling pressures and restrictive ﬁlling pattern (49,50). Patients usually present with complete atrioventricular block and ventricular conduction abnormalities correlating with diffuse extensive oxalate inﬁltration of the cardiac conduction system (50,51). QRS complex voltage is either increased or normal because of asymmetrical and heterogeneous involvement of the myocardium, which can inconsistently exhibit true hypertrophy (51).
There has been no consistent effect of daily hemodialysis or of combined liver-kidney transplantation to improve oxalate balance and reverse the echocardiographic abnormalities (51,52). Mucopolysaccharidoses. The mucopolysaccharidoses represent inborn errors of metabolism due to deﬁciencies in

lysosomal enzymes that break down glycosaminoglycans (53). The accumulation of partially degraded mucopolysaccharides impairs proper cell function and leads to various clinical manifestations. These disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and affect men and women equally (54). Depending on the type of mucopolysaccharidosis, affected patients may have normal intellect or may be

profoundly retarded, experience developmental delay, or have severe behavioral problems (55). Cardiac disease occurs in almost 100% of all subtypes of mucopolysaccharidoses, but the most severe cardiac involvement is seen in type I (Hurler-Scheie syndrome) (56). Prominent valvular thickening, diffuse coronary artery narrowing, myocardial thickening, and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common ﬁndings (12,56). Asymmetrical septal hypertrophy occurs early, followed by thickening of the valves (56,57). The mitral and the aortic valves are more frequently involved, producing insufﬁciency and/or stenosis (56) (Fig. 2). LV systolic function is usually normal (56). ECG evidence of LV hypertrophy is uncommon (53,56). Small QRS complex voltages may be due to poor conductance of glycosaminoglycans (56). Rare intraventricular conduction delay or malignant arrhythmias have been reported (56).
Diagnosis often can be made through clinical examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body ﬂuids in culture for enzyme deﬁciency) are also used to provide deﬁnitive diagnosis of 1 of the mucopolysaccharidoses.
Valve replacement has been successful in patients with severe mitral valve disease (58,59). Enzyme replacement therapy and bone marrow transplantation showed improvements in cardiac structure and function in both human and animal studies (60,61). Death occurs early and is often due to cardiovascular complications (12,56).
Inﬁltrative Cardiomyopathies That Look Like
Ischemic or Nonischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy
Cardiac sarcoidosis. This granulomatous disease tends to affect the basal septum, atrioventricular node and atrioventricular (His) bundle, focal regions in the ventricular free walls, and the papillary muscles. Two-dimensional echocardiographic characteristics of cardiac sarcoid vary according to disease activity and include wall thickening (Ͼ13 mm) due to granulomatous expansion and wall thinning (Ͻ7 mm) due to ﬁbrosis. With scar retraction, aneurysms

may develop, especially if the patient has been treated with corticosteroids (Fig. 5). Other echocardiographic features include normal to dilated ventricular chambers, normal to reduced systolic function, global to segmental hypokinesia, and uniform thickening of left and right atrial endocardium (62,63). Segmental wall motion abnormalities characteristically do not conform to any particular coronary distribution (64). In contrast to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, dyskinetic or akinetic segments are interspersed with normokinetic segments, resulting in an uneven wall motion abnormality in sarcoidosis (65). Pulmonary involvement occurs in 90% of patients with sarcoidosis, and the presence of pulmonary artery hypertension is an ominous sign and warrants referral for lung transplantation (66,67). Thus, Doppler echocardiographic examination should include the assessment of pulmonary pressures and right ventricular function to detect early signs of pulmonary hypertension.
Because of the varied echocardiographic presentations of cardiac sarcoidosis, 2-dimensional echocardiography is not sensitive or speciﬁc enough to detect early or small localized areas of myocardial involvement (68). Contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging and (18F-ﬂuoro-2deoxyglucose positron emission tomography are more sensitive, and ﬁndings seem to correlate with disease severity (68,69). In contrast to ischemic cardiomyopathy, in which LGE always involves the subendocardium with different degrees of transmural extension, LGE in cardiac sarcoid is patchy and typically involves the basal and lateral LV walls only (70).
Atypical infarction pattern and infrahisian atrioventricular block are commonly observed on the ECG (65,68,71). Unlike idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial ﬂutter or ﬁbrillation is not common in cardiac sarcoid.
There are no randomized controlled trials to provide clear guidance for the treatment of sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement. Therefore, therapy should be supportive and follow general principles for the management of sarcoidosis (62,72).

Wegener granulomatosis. Wegener granulomatosis is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inﬂammation, with vasculitis affecting many organ systems, particularly the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys (73). In a series of 85 patients with conﬁrmed Wegener granulomatosis who underwent echocardiography, 26 (36%) had conﬁrmed cardiac abnormalities attributable to the disease (74). Regional wall motion abnormalities were found in 17 (65%), mild mitral regurgitation in 14 (54%), LV systolic dysfunction in 13 (50%), and pericardial effusion in 5 (19%) (74). Those with associated cardiac abnormalities had a higher mortality rate (46%) than those without (39%) (74). Cardiac sarcoidosis is suspected when regional wall motion abnormalities occur in relatively young asymptomatic patients with low cardiovascular risk proﬁles and are not conﬁned to a speciﬁc coronary artery territory (74). LGE in the midwall rather than the subendocardium is consistent with ﬁbrosis rather than infarction (75).
Management of Wegener granulomatosis requires a multidisciplinary approach. Any patient with Wegener granulomatosis and cardiac involvement is classiﬁed as having “severe” disease, deﬁned as being life threatening or placing the affected organ at immediate risk for irreversible damage (76). Glucocorticosteroids and cyclophosphamide remain the standard of care for remission induction. Hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis represents an iron overload disorder or iron storage disease characterized by the accumulation of excessive iron within the cells of various internal organs. It may result from a genetic defect (hereditary hemochromatosis) or from secondary causes (secondary hemochromatosis) (12).
Cardiac hemochromatosis (iron heart) is a weak heart that is characterized by systolic dysfunction. Only rarely is diastolic dysfunction the dominant abnormality. Twodimensional echocardiography may not be able to distinguish cardiac hemochromatosis from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (Fig. 4). CMR can detect and quantify myocardial iron inﬁltration using T2 cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (77,78).
The QRS complex voltage and duration are generally preserved because of the absence of marked ﬁbrosis with largely preserved cardiac myocytes and the nonconductive property of iron (79). With advanced disease, the ECG can have abnormal results (low QRS complex voltage) with repolarization abnormalities (79).
Liver biopsy is the deﬁnitive test for iron overload (80). With functional cardiac involvement, stainable sarcoplasmic iron is demonstrable in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy tissues; normally, there is no stainable iron in the heart. With time, excessive sarcoplasmic iron may cause myocyte degeneration and delicate interstitial ﬁbrosis (12).
Cessation of multiple blood transfusions, phlebotomy, and chelation therapy have been shown to reverse cardiac abnormalities due to iron overload (81– 83) (Fig. 3). Some patients may require combined liver and heart transplantation (84).

Conclusions
The inﬁltrative cardiomyopathies are a diverse group of cardiac diseases, which are characterized by the deposition of abnormal substances within heart tissue that cause the ventricular walls to develop either diastolic dysfunction or, less commonly, systolic dysfunction. Although amyloid heart disease is commonly cited as the prototype of inﬁltrative heart disease, it does not exemplify the diversity of the inﬁltrative diseases. Because these disorders are relatively rare and their physiologic and morphologic characteristics are so variable, they tend to be misdiagnosed. Doppler echocardiographic evaluation and ECG, and CMR in some cases, in conjunction with the clinical manifestations, play a vital role in establishing an accurate diagnosis and planning the appropriate treatment.
