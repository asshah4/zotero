Abstract We present a new method to describe the dynamics of the beat-to-beat RR time series. The classiﬁcation of the phase-space plots obtained from RR time series is performed by a calculation of parameters which describe the features of the two-dimensional plot. We demonstrate that every parameter has its speciﬁc consequence on the evaluation of the state of the cardiac function. By applying the method to the DIAMOND MI study we demonstrate that these parameters have more prognostic power than previously suggested risk markers. The results suggest that the RR intervals constitute a highly complex time series which necessitates the use of reﬁned mathematical–statistical methods in order to reveal pathologies in the heart rate.

1. Introduction

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) is an important prognostic factor predicting sudden arrhythmic death after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (Task force of The European Society of Cardiology 1996, Tapanainen et al 2002, Wessel et al 2000b, Kleiger et al 1987, Schwartz et al 1992, Meyerburg et al 1992, Malik et al 1990, Makikallio et al 1999). Several studies have demonstrated increased arrhythmic as well as non-arrhythmic mortality in AMI populations with low HRV. Those studies included traditional methods based on time- or frequency-domain analysis and newer fractal analysis techniques which are based on time-domain analysis (Thurner et al 1998a, 1998b, Peng et al 1995, Ma¨kikallio et al 2001, Saermark et al 2000,

Ashkenazy et al 2001, Wilson et al 2002, Voss et al 1996, Schmidt et al 1999, Wessel et al 2000a).
Two methods have separated themselves exhibiting more prognostic power than the others in comparative studies. One is the short-term fractal scaling exponent α1 which evolved as a powerful predictor of death in the survivors of AMI (Peng et al 1995). In a comparative study it was shown that α1 is a better predictor of death than the traditional measures of HRV among patients with AMI and a low wall motion index. It also predicted independently arrhythmic death which neither of the traditional HRV measures did after adjustment for clinical risk factors (Huikuri et al 2000).
The other is the multipole method, a recently developed method to describe time series with a highly complex time evolution computing various parameters (the multipoles) descriptive of the time series (Lewkowicz et al 2002, Bloch Thomsen et al 2001). In clinical medicine, the dynamics of the RR time series is commonly represented by the so-called recurrence plot (Huikuri et al 1996, Kamen et al 1995, 1996, Brennan et al 2002), where each RR interval is plotted against the previous one. The method replaces the classiﬁcation of the recurrence plot by visual inspection with the computation of the various multipoles. The two-dimensional recurrence plot is interpreted as a two-dimensional body where each data point is assigned a unit mass; the origin of the coordinate system is chosen in the centre of mass. Therefore one does not ignore the varying density of data points in the recurrence plots which might lead to similar contours for different heart dynamics, which has been the major obstacle for bedside application (Malik 1998). Each of these multipoles constitutes a measure exhibiting its particular facet for assessing the heart function. It includes, but also extends beyond, the integrative measures of HRV.

1.1. The DIAMOND MI study
The DIAMOND MI was a randomized double-blind-controlled study of Dofetilide in post-MI patients (The DIAMOND Study Group 1997). The study included screening of consecutive patients with left ventricular dysfunction in association with recent myocardial infarction. It included patients with an acute MI and a left ventricular wall motion index (WMI) < 1.2. A substudy of the DIAMOND MI was designed in order to determine and compare the prognostic power of traditional HRV measures with those of new fractal measures (Huikuri et al 2000). HRV was obtained from consecutive RR intervals from 24 h ECG recordings 5–10 days after AMI. Results were reported on 446 patients who fulﬁlled the criteria for meaningful RR interval variability analysis. The mortality was 25.6% after a follow-up of 685 + 360 days (114 died). 75 deaths (17%) were classiﬁed as arrhythmic and 28 (6.3%) were classiﬁed as non-arrhythmic cardiac deaths.

2. Methods
The present study makes use of four different multipoles: one of the quadrupole moments, two of the octupole moments and a hexadecapole-related moment.
The quadrupole moment Qyy describes the overall distribution of the data points along and vertical to the diagon√al of the recurrence plot. It vanishes for an elliptically shaped distribution with an axis ratio of 2/1, where the data points are Gaussian distributed along the principal axes.
One of the octupole moments (Txxx) expresses the skewness of the two-dimensional body along the x-axis and the other (Tyyy) on the y-axis.

The hexadecapole-related moment we employ is the ratio of the kurtosis along the y-axis and the kurtosis along the x-axis, κyx. The kurtosis vanishes for a Gaussian distribution and is increasingly positive for progressively more peaked distributions.
2.1. Univariate analysis
The outcome variable was death within the follow-up period (685 + 360 days). For each of the four variables (multipoles) the cut-point which maximizes the sum of
sensitivity and speciﬁcity was chosen.
2.2. Multivariate analysis
After ﬁxing the cut-points each variable was considered as a binary one. We used the multiple logistic regression. The appropriate model assumed that log(p/(1 − p)), where p is the probability of death, is the linear combination of the four multipole variables and their paired interactions (products). We used the backward elimination approach, which started with the model with all four multipole variables and all six interactions and step by step excluded one of the variables or interactions, which did not signiﬁcantly improve the goodness-of-ﬁt (the agreement between the model and the data).
The ﬁnal model included only effects signiﬁcant on the standard level of 0.05. In section 3 we show the odds ratio (i.e. the ratio of the odds of the death in patients with highrisk values versus low-risk values) and the 95% conﬁdence limits for all the variables in the ﬁnal model.
All calculations were performed using SAS 8.12. (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
3. Results
The dichotomized variables for bad prognosis, i.e. death within the follow-up period, were deﬁned as Qyy −750, Txxx −25, Tyyy −3.567 and κyx < 1.96.

parameters (CMP4). The predictive power of these measures is compared with those of the other, more traditional HRV measures (α1, SDNN, HF, LF and LF/HF) (Huikuri et al 2000).
The ﬁnal model of the multiple logistic regression included the dichotomized variables:
κyx (OR = 3.255, 95% CI = (2.020, 5.243)) Tyyy (OR = 1.936, 95% CI = (1.196, 3.136)) Txxx (OR = 2.168, 95% CI = (−1.333, −3.525)) (OR: odds ratio, CI: conﬁdence interval).
This combined model of three multipole parameters (CMP3) achieves the sensitivity of 79.8%, the speciﬁcity of 55.4% and an overall predictive accuracy of 65%.
By combining all of the four multipole parameters (CMP4) one obtains an overall predictive accuracy of 67%.
Table 2 lists ten patients from the DIAMOND MI study which have low-risk Qyy values but an elevated risk kurtosis ratio (<2.5). The mortality in this group was 90%, remarkably high relative to the overall mortality of 25.6%.
Figure 1 shows Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the scaling exponent α1, the SDNN and the combined parameter CMP4.
In order to demonstrate the relevance of the octupoles we include ﬁgure 2 which shows recurrence plots for two of the recordings from the DIAMOND MI study with similar quadrupoles. Figure 2(a) shows a survivor with the highest concentration of data points on the positive part of the x-axis (negative octupole), whereas ﬁgure 2(b) shows the plot of a deceased individual with the major part of data points concentrated on the negative part of the x-axis (positive octupole).
4. Discussion
The series of RR intervals is an excellent example of a non-stationary and non-linear time series with a very complex behaviour. It seems reasonable to expect that the regulation of the heart rhythm, which is a very complex mechanism due to its dependence on many subsystems in the body, can be described optimally only by a method which has a diversity of different parameters describing partly different behaviours of those subsystems.
The quadrupole moment, although resembling a standard deviation for the twodimensional distribution, differs fundamentally from the one-dimensional standard deviation

of the RR interval time series, the SDNN, which does not include any time ordering (shufﬂing the RR intervals will result in the same value for SDNN). The various multipoles due to the very construction of the recurrence plot bear intrinsic time dependence and thus convey a quantiﬁcation of the cardiac system’s dynamical properties. This explains why Qyy is superior to SDNN as a prognostic indicator.

Nevertheless, a low-risk quadrupole, indicating a considerable spread of data points, might also be obtained by large concentration of data points near the average value (the heart beats for extended periods with a low variability) together with spots of high density of points far away from the average (the heart beating some periods with a very high variability, as typical

for arrhythmia). This conﬁguration results in a high-risk kurtosis ratio. This combination of low-risk quadrupole with a high-risk kurtosis ratio appears in the DIAMOND MI study in ten individuals, listed in table 2.
A similar analysis can be applied to the octupole moments. Two different distributions with the same mean and the same variance may differ with respect to the position of their maxima relative to their common mean. Skewness is a quantitative measure of this lack of symmetry. A distribution with the position of its maximum below the mean is said to be positively skewed, and vice versa. For a two-dimensional distribution as the RR recurrence plot, the octupole moments in respect with a principal axis can be connected to the skewness of the projection of the distribution along this axis. A negative octupole/skewness along the x-axis implies that the heart beats for extended periods with a low pulse rate (large RR intervals), while a positive octupole/skewness along the x-axis implies that the heart beats with a high pulse rate for extended periods.
A high concentration of data points on the negative y-axis (positive y-skewness) indicates a slow decrease and a fast increase in the heart rate which is a sign of an impaired sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nervous system. Negative skewness on the y-axis, implying a slowly increasing and a fast decreasing pulse, is hence one of the indications for a well-functioning heart function.
The ﬁrst relevant multipole moment, the quadrupole (the dipole vanishes due to the choice of the origin), turns out to be a stronger risk indicator than SDNN (overall predictive accuracy 60 versus 56). Combining the other multipoles that were used in this study into a single measure by a multivariate analysis results in a measure which is a much more potent predictor than SDNN (65 versus 56) and similar to α1. Combining all four measures results in a predictor (CMP4) superior to all other predictors used in the DIAMOND MI study (Huikuri et al 2000).

5. Conclusion
The study shows that the multipole method provides more prognostic information on patients after acute myocardial infarction than previously suggested risk markers.
The method includes all the integrative measures of heart rate variability, but exceeds the predictive ability of traditional HRV due to the additional dynamic information gained by the individual moments obtained by expanding the RR recurrence plot.
