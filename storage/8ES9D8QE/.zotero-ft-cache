Objective: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. Methods: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age ϭ 11.1 years; 50.7% ϭ girls) from the Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). Results: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. Conclusions: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk. Key words: depressive symptoms, autonomic function, heart rate, baroreflex, cortisol, children.

INTRODUCTION
Depression has been shown to be associated with worse prognosis and mortality in patients with various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (1–3). Also, without the presence or a prior history of heart disease, depressed individuals are at increased risk of CVD and cardiac death (4). Even subclinical levels of depressive symptoms have been found to be propor-

tionally associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in both patients with CVD and healthy individuals (4).
Alterations of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have been proposed as possible physiological links between depression and cardiovascular prognosis (5,6). Low heart rate variability (HRV) and reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) are not only well-established risk factors for cardiac mortality in patients with CVD (7), but have also been related to depression in individuals with (8,9) and without CVD (10,11). Likewise, elevated cortisol levels have been associated with CVD and increased mortality risk in patients with chronic heart failure (12,13) as well as with depression in individuals with (14) and without (15) CVD, although decreased levels of cortisol have also been reported (13,16).
Depression is a heterogeneous disorder, involving a range of cognitive, somatic, and affective symptoms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for the associations with cardiovascular prognosis (17–19). De Jonge et al. (18) showed that, in patients with myocardial infarction (MI), somatic/affective depressive symptoms were associated with a poor cardiovascular prognosis 2.5 years later, whereas cognitive/affective depressive symptoms were not. These findings were recently replicated in a study by Linke et al. (19) in women with suspected myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, Watkins et al. (20) reported that somatic depressive symptoms in depressed patients with MI were more strongly related to medical comorbidity than nonsomatic (cognitive) depressive symptoms. Barefoot et al. (17), on the other hand, found that only affective and not somatic depressive symptoms predicted long-term mortality in a sample of patients hospitalized for coronary angiography. This seeming contradiction might partly be explained by different instruments used or item overlap. Barefoot’s affective dimension overlapped considerably with De Jonge’s somatic/affective dimension; that is, both contained sadness, crying, and irritability. In sum, despite differences in design, sample, and

measures used, all studies concluded that cardiovascular prognosis and mortality could be predicted from some, but not all, symptoms of depression.
Although evidence has been accumulating that symptom dimensions of depression are differentially related to cardiovascular prognosis, associations with more general cardiac autonomic function largely remain to be determined. A study by De Jonge et al. (21) revealed that low HRV was related to somatic and not to cognitive depressive symptoms, which suggests the presence of such differential associations. However, this study was conducted in patients with MI, not in nondiseased individuals, which may have affected the results. At present, studies regarding young individuals without any CVD are lacking. Another issue that still needs clarification concerns the possibility that somatic and cognitive symptoms also have a differential relationship with HPA axis functioning, which could suggest a broader risk profile than just cardiovascular prognosis.
The purpose of this study was to investigate possible specific associations of somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms with HRV, BRS, and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in a large population cohort of preadolescents. The study sample was 10 years old to 12 years old, an age at which the large modifications in cardiac autonomic function observed in childhood tend to level off (22–24), and cortisol production rates resemble adult levels (25). Several studies (26 –28), also within the present cohort (29,30), have examined and—sometimes—found associations of autonomic measures and cortisol with internalizing problems in children and adolescents, but none has explicitly focused on heterogeneity within the depressive spectrum so far.
METHODS Subjects
This study is based on data from the Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a large cohort study of Dutch adolescents (31). The current paper concerns a cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline (March 2001 to July 2002), which involved 2230 children (response rate ϭ 76.0%; mean age ϭ 11.09 years; standard deviation [SD] ϭ 0.56; 50.8% ϭ girls). Detailed information about the sample selection and nonresponse has been given elsewhere (32). Parental written informed consent was obtained after complete description of the study, and all preadolescents participated in the measurements voluntarily. The study was approved by the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CCMO).
Of the total sample of 2230 preadolescents, 2049 (91.9%) participated in the autonomic or HPA axis measurements (1868 in the autonomic measurements, 1768 in the HPA axis measurements). The participants did differ from the rest of the TRAILS sample regarding sex and depressive symptoms. Quality checks of the autonomic measurements, described by Dietrich et al. (33), resulted in 1781 reliable HRV and 1472 BRS measurements, with scores of self-reported depressive symptoms recorded for 1765 and 1462 subjects, respectively. Complete assayable morning cortisol samples were available for 1667 participants, of whom 1640 had valid self-reported depressive symptoms scores.
Depressive Symptoms
Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a self-reported evaluation of the child’s emotional and behavioral problems in the past 6 months (34). Questionnaires were filled out at school in groups, under the supervision of one or more TRAILS assistants. The 13 items

(covering depressed mood, anhedonia, loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, suicidal ideation, sleep problems, and eating problems) of the YSR Affective Problems Scale (Cronbach’s ␣ ϭ 0.77) reflect symptoms of a Major Depressive Episode according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) (35). Each item could be rated as 0 ϭ not true; 1 ϭ somewhat or sometimes true; or 2 ϭ very true or often true. The scale score represents the mean item scores. The convergent validity of the Affective Problems scale with standardized clinical DSM-IV diagnoses of major depressive disorder and dysthymia has been found to be adequate (36).
Corrected-item-mean imputation (37) was employed to handle missing data if Ͻ30% of the items were unanswered. If more items were unanswered, the YSR scale was considered incomplete and the data were discarded in subsequent analyses (n ϭ 44). Preliminary analysis showed that all item-total correlations were Ͼ0.35, except for the item “I sleep more than most kids” (r ϭ .24), omission of which increased the internal consistency. The remaining 12 items were divided into a somatic subscale (five items, Cronbach’s ␣ ϭ 0.58) and a cognitive-affective subscale (seven items, Cronbach’s ␣ ϭ 0.67), based on item content. The items are listed in Table 1. Confirmative factor analysis using MPlus 3.11 software yielded empirical support for these two YSR subscales, with goodness-of-fit indices (Comparative Fit Index ϭ 0.92; Tucker-Lewis Index ϭ 0.94; root mean square error of approximation ϭ 0.06; standardized root mean square residual ϭ 0.06) that indicated an adequate fit to the sample data (38,39). The two depression dimensions were moderately correlated (r ϭ .46).
Cardiac Autonomic Measures
Individual measurements of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) took place in a quiet room at school, generally in the morning (8:30 AM–12 PM) and occasionally in the early afternoon (1 PM–3 PM). Participants were informed about the procedure as they were in the supine position, and encouraged to relax and not to move or speak during the data acquisition. HR was measured by three precordial leads and continuous BP was measured by using a Portapres device (FMS Finapres Medical Symptoms, BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Recordings did not start until signals had reached a stabilized steady state. Children were in the supine position for about 5 minutes before measurements were started. BP and HR signals were registered for 4 minutes as the patients were in the supine position during spontaneous breathing. Recordings were digitized, using a DAS-12 data acquisition card for notebooks (Keithley Instruments, Cleveland, Ohio), and stored on hard disk for offline analysis. The sample rate was 100 Hz. We used a special interpolation algorithm, which increased the time resolution for R-peak detection by a factor of 2.5. This resulted in interbeat intervals (IBIs) with

sufficient resolution for HRV determination (40). Calculation of HRV and BRS was based on power spectral analysis, using the CARSPAN spectral analysis software program. CARSPAN allows for the Discrete Fourier Transformation of nonequidistant BP and IBI series. The analyzed time series were checked and corrected for artifacts, as described by Dietrich and colleagues (33). HRV was defined as the IBI power in the low-frequency (LF ϭ 0.07– 0.14 Hz) and high-frequency (HF ϭ 0.15– 0.40 Hz) band, respectively, and expressed in ms2. Although sometimes debated (41), the HRV in the LF band (HRV-LF) is largely assumed to reflect both sympathetic and vagal modulation of cardiac control (42). HRV in the HF band (HRV-HF), which is associated with the respiratory cycle and often referred to as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, results from centrally mediated cardiac vagal activity. Hence, HRV-HF is considered as an index of vagal tone. BRS was defined as the mean modulus between systolic BP and IBI in the LF band and is expressed in ms/mm Hg (33,40,43).
We are aware of contrasting perspectives on the need to assess and control for respiration, as recommended by the Task Force of the European Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology in 1996 (44 – 47). However, research has shown that the amplitude of HRV is not affected by respiration frequency under baseline conditions (48). Another source of measurement variation is the use of spontaneous, instead of paced, breathing (49). When breathing spontaneously, children differ in their breathing patterns (50), but the method of spontaneous breathing provides sufficiently reliable HRV measurements, provided that the children breathe normally and avoid slow or irregular breathing (51).
Cortisol
Participants received a verbal and written instruction to collect saliva at home immediately after waking up as they were still lying in bed (Cort1) and 30 minutes after awakening (Cort2), using the Sarstedt Salivette device (Nu¨mbrecht, Germany). Participants were instructed not to collect saliva when feeling ill (e.g., having a cold, headache) or when menstruating, and if possible, to refrain from taking medication. Furthermore, both the sampling and the preceding day should be normal school days, without special events or stressful circumstances. Deviations from this protocol had to be recorded on an accompanying form. Concerning the sampling procedure, participants were instructed to rinse their mouth thoroughly with tap water and not to consume sour products or brush their teeth shortly before sampling saliva. Directly after sampling, saliva samples were stored by participants in their freezer and mailed as soon as possible to the institute. The mean self-reported sampling time of the morning samples was 7 AM for Cort1 and 7:30 AM for Cort2. Salivary cortisol was measured by a time-resolved immunoassay with fluorometric detection (DELFIA) with intra- and interassay coefficients of variation of 4.0% to 6.7% and 7.1% to 9.0%, respectively (52).
Covariates
Sex, age, physical activity, physical health, and body mass index were included as covariates. Participants indicated their level of physical activity by reporting how often they performed sports, such as swimming, playing soccer, or horseback riding on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 ϭ (almost) never to 4 ϭ six to seven times a week. Physical health was based on the number of parent-reported physical health problems of the preadolescent during the past year. Body mass index was calculated by dividing the weight (kg) by the square of the height (m2). Information regarding oral contraceptives use and smoking was also available, but because none of the participants used oral contraceptives and only very few (Ͻ1%) were regular smokers, these variables were not included in this study.
Data Cleaning
Participants with extreme (Ͼ3 SD from the mean) HRV (n ϭ 12) or BRS (n ϭ 12) values were excluded from ANS analyses, resulting in 1753 cases with valid HRV and 1450 cases with valid BRS data. There were fewer BRS than HRV data, because calculation of the BRS requires both valid HR and valid BP measurements, whereas calculation of the HRV is only based on HR data. Sixty participants were excluded from the cortisol analyses due to the use of corticosteroid-containing medication (n ϭ 22), extreme cortisol values (Ͼ3 SD from the mean, n ϭ 29), or lack of compliance with the protocol (n ϭ

9). Lack of compliance was defined as failing to take the first sample within 5 minutes of awakening or the second sample between 25 and 35 minutes after awakening. This resulted in 1580 participants for whom the CAR could be calculated. The CAR was measured by the trapezoid method, using the area under the curve with respect to the increase, as described by Pruessner et al. (53), which comes down to ((Cort2 Ϫ Cort1)/2) ϫ 0.50. This measure emphasizes changes over time. For 459 (29%) of the 1580 participants, cortisol levels did not increase after awakening, but were lower than or equal to half an hour after awakening than immediately after waking up. This percentage of participants with a negative cortisol slope (CAR nonresponders) is comparable to percentages reported by others (54,55).
Statistical Analysis
To approximate a normal distribution, all autonomic variables were transformed to their natural logarithm. In addition to the (transformed) levels of HRV-LF and HRV-HF, we also calculated normalized units, that is, the power in the LF and HF spectrum, respectively, divided by the total power minus the very LF component. Significance levels (two-tailed) were set at p Ͻ .05 for all analyses. All analyses were performed in SPSS (version 14, SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).
First, we examined associations of HRV, BRS, and CAR with overall depressive symptoms. Separate linear regression analyses were conducted with each physiological measure (HRV-LF, HRV-HF, BRS, and CAR) as the dependent variable and the overall depressive symptoms scale as the predictor. Subsequently, these analyses were repeated with the somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms scales as predictors (in a single model, so adjusted for each other) to examine differences between the two subscales.
Gender, age, body mass index, physical activity, and physical health were considered possible confounders and therefore included as covariates in all analyses. Furthermore, for each of the depression variables entered in the regression models, we tested interactions with sex (coded as girls ϭ 0; boys ϭ 1) in a second step. In case of significant interaction effects, post hoc analyses in each of the subgroups were performed to explore the nature of the differences.
RESULTS Descriptive Statistics
Items of the somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms scale are listed in Table 1. Mean and SD values of all variables used in this study are shown in Table 2. As might be expected, the three autonomic measures were strongly correlated (rHRVLF–HRVHF ϭ .81, rHRVLF–BRS ϭ .69, rHRVHF–BRS ϭ .64; all p Ͻ .01), whereas none of the autonomic measures was

Depression Effects on Cardiac Autonomic Function
Overall depressive symptoms were not associated with any of the autonomic measures (Table 3). The somatic symptoms were significantly inversely associated with HRV-LF and BRS, but not with HRV-HF. The cognitive-affective symptoms were positively associated with all three ANS measures. None of the associations with the autonomic measures showed significant sex differences (all p Ͼ .19). Normalized HRV measures were not related to any of the depression (sub)scales (all p Ͼ .17).
As the standardized regression coefficients (␤) indicated, the effect sizes were generally small. To illustrate the magnitude of the effects, we calculated the range of possible (i.e., based on depression scores between 0 and 2) HRV and BRS values, given the subscale models presented in Table 3 and assuming mean values on all covariates. Estimated HRV-LF scores ranged between 6.11 and 7.03, HRV-HF scores between 7.13 and 8.01, and BRS scores between 2.34 and 2.96. These maximum estimated differences were all Ͻ1 SD.
Depression Effects on the CAR
Overall depressive symptoms were not associated with HPA axis function as measured with the CAR (Table 3). The effect of somatic symptoms on the CAR seemed significantly different for boys and girls (␤ ϭ 0.10, p ϭ .02), whereas a marginally significant interaction with sex was found for cognitive-affective symptoms (␤ ϭ Ϫ0.08, p ϭ .07). Post hoc analyses revealed that neither somatic nor cognitive-affective symptoms were associated with the CAR in girls, whereas in

boys, somatic symptoms were positively related to the CAR and cognitive-affective symptoms were inversely related to the CAR (Table 3). Again, effect sizes were small. Possible estimated CAR values in boys ranged between 0.36 and 1.30.
DISCUSSION
Overall self-reported depressive symptoms were not associated with HRV, BRS, and CAR in a large population cohort of preadolescents. After dividing the symptoms into somatic versus cognitive-affective symptoms, however, contrasting relationships with the physiological measures emerged. Somatic depressive symptoms were inversely associated with HRV and BRS, and positively with CAR, whereas cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively associated with HRV and BRS, and negatively with CAR. The associations with the CAR were only found in boys. The effect sizes were very small, but taking into account the nonclinical nature of the sample and the fact that both depressive symptoms and physiological measures are influenced by a multitude of factors, we feel that higher effect sizes could not be expected, and that the results should not be discarded as trivial.
Our findings are consonant with the growing evidence that depression is a heterogeneous disorder, which encompasses different underlying pathophysiological processes (56,57), and that only some depressive symptoms account for the relationship between depression and cardiovascular prognosis (17–20). De Jonge et al. (21) found that low HRV was associated with somatic symptoms of depression in patients with stable coronary heart disease. Our results confirm these findings in a population cohort of preadolescents without (overt) CVD and in whom depressive symptoms were generally mild at the most. We extended De Jonge’s findings not

only to a nonclinical sample but also to other important indicators of physiological regulation, that is, BRS and CAR. Somatic depressive symptoms were more strongly associated with the LF band of HRV and BRS than with the HF band of HRV. It is tempting to speculate that the assumed dual innervation (sympathetic and vagal) reflected in the HRV-LF, as opposed to mainly vagal influences in the HRV-HF band, accounts for these differences. However, replication of this finding as well as prospective associations between LF power and pathology are needed before HRV-LF may be considered a prognostic tool similar to HRV-HF. The findings with regard to the normalized HRV measures suggest that the relative value of each power component was not related to any of the depression scales.
A recent meta-analysis by Chida and Steptoe (58), investigating the association between the CAR and psychosocial factors, concluded that there was a lack of overall associations in regard to depression, due to both increased and reduced CARs. The reverse effects found for somatic and cognitiveaffective symptoms of depression might partially explain these inconsistent findings. Yet, our findings are counterintuitive. A high CAR, which has often been related to life stress (58), was associated with somatic depressive symptoms, whereas a blunted CAR, which has been related to fatigue (58), was associated with cognitive/affective symptoms. Furthermore, most effects found in prior studies (also) concerned females, whereas we only found associations in boys. So, although it is interesting that the differential effects for somatic and cognitive/affective symptoms did not only concern cardiac autonomic measures but the HPA axis as well, the nature of the cortisol effects is still puzzling.
The association of cognitive-affective depressive symptoms with high HRV was unforeseen, and contrary to results reported by De Jonge et al. (21), who did not find an association between HRV and the cognitive dimension of depression. However, their study concerned patients with stable coronary heart disease, whose age and lifestyle (e.g., smoking) differed markedly from our population. These factors may have accounted for the divergent findings in both studies. Our findings are in concordance with Rottenberg et al. (59,60), who reported a positive association between HRV-HF and cognitive-affective symptoms like sadness and crying in clinically depressed participants. Also, interesting in this respect are results reported by Koelsch et al. (61), who found that high HRV-HF was associated with high emotionality, and by Miller and Wood (62), whose study revealed that an increase in self-reported sadness was accompanied by an increase in HRV. Tentatively, the positive associations of cognitive-affective symptoms with cardiac autonomic measures might be explained by Porges’ notion that high resting HRV(-HF) reflects perception of a safe environment, which allows social engagement and the expression of emotions (60,63). Whatever the reason, our findings as well as previous findings suggest that, in itself and when not associated with somatic symptoms, emotionality may not be associated with increased cardiac risk.
The heterogeneous nature of depression is of interest in

view of the different measurement instruments that are used to assess the syndrome. Somatic symptoms are omitted from some of these instruments, for instance, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (64). Other scales, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (65), contain relatively many somatic items. These kinds of disbalances can mask differential relationships of cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function with subdimensions of depression, and may partly explain discrepant associations found between depressive symptoms and indices of the ANS and HPA axis. Our data provide a basis for more specific pathophysiological hypotheses on the relationship between depression and cardiovascular prognosis. Both the ANS and the HPA axis were associated with the depressive symptom dimensions, suggesting that depression as a— putative— cardiac risk factor may be mediated by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms.
This study had several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow inferences about causality. Whether depressive symptoms are the outcome or the cause of the physiological variables under study still needs to be determined. Second, the YSR Affective Problems scale was constructed on the basis of expert ratings of the original, empirically derived YSR items, and was not originally developed to assess depressive problems according to the DSM-IV criteria. Consequently, the items do not represent one-to-one counterparts with all DSM-IV criteria. Another limitation of the YSR Affective Problems scale is the use of a 6-month time window, which precludes a clear distinction between state and trait effects. As the severity of depressive problems may covary with physiological functioning (66), multiple assessments of physiological functioning and state depression are needed to distinguish between state and trait effects. Finally, the internal consistency of the two depression subscales was low, even when taking into account the small number of items. This probably influenced the estimated effects conservatively, and suggests that these scales are still heterogeneous. Heterogeneity within the cognitive-affective domain was also reported by Rottenberg (59), who found that sadness and crying were positively, and suicidal ideation negatively associated with HRV-HF (it should be noted, however, that this finding did not replicate in another study) (60). More fine-tuned patterns of association were beyond the scope of this article, but may be revealed in future studies.
In conclusion, the present study revealed that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially associated with the ANS and the HPA axis in preadolescents. Hence, alterations of the ANS that have been linked with cardiac risk are associated with somatic depressive symptoms as early as in preadolescence. Future research should take into account that associations between depression and HRV, BRS, and CAR variables are partly dependent on whether and how somatic and cognitive-affective symptoms are represented in the depression measures used.
