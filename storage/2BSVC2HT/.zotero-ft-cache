BACKGROUND Few epidemiologic cohort studies have evaluated atrial ﬂutter (ﬂutter) as an arrhythmia distinct from atrial ﬁbrillation (AF).
OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical correlates of ﬂutter and its associated outcomes to distinguish them from those associated with AF in the Framingham Heart Study.
METHODS We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classiﬁed as ﬂutter or AF/ﬂutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of ﬂutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each ﬂutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with ﬂutter with Cox models.
RESULTS During mean follow-up of 33.0 Ϯ 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 Ϯ 10 years, 30% women) developed ﬂutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.54–5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD, 95% CI 1.03–1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25,

95% CI 1.05–4.80) and heart failure (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26–21.64) were associated with incident ﬂutter. In age- and sex-adjusted models, ﬂutter (vs referents) was associated with 10-year increased risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.01, 95% CI 3.14–7.99), myocardial infarction (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.42–6.59), heart failure (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.90–8.99), stroke (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.13–4.17), and mortality (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44–2.79).
CONCLUSION We identiﬁed the clinical correlates associated with ﬂutter and observed that ﬂutter was associated with multiple adverse outcomes.

Introduction
Atrial ﬂutter (ﬂutter) has often been combined with atrial
ﬁbrillation (AF) in major epidemiologic studies, including the Framingham Heart Study (FHS),1 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC),2 and Rotterdam Study,3 as well as in clinical trials of anticoagulation4 and antiarrhythmic agents.5 One likely reason for combining the arrhythmias is that ﬂutter is far less common than AF6 and may be misdiagnosed by physicians.7 Flutter has a distinct

underlying electrophysiologic mechanism and may be more difﬁcult to pharmacologically rate control than AF.8 In addition, ﬂutter and AF may occur in the same individual over time.9
Flutter is classiﬁed as typical or atypical. Typical ﬂutter describes a macroreentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus characterized by organized atrial activity.10,11 Atypical ﬂutter describes a wide variety of reentrant circuits in either the left or right atrium (not involving the cavotricuspid isthmus) and can be difﬁcult to diagnose on electrocardiogram (ECG) alone.8,12 In comparison, disorganized, uncoordinated atrial activity is seen in AF. We hypothesized that although there would be overlap between risk factors for typical ﬂutter and AF, there also would be differences due to the varying underlying electrophysiologic mechanisms. In addition, we postulated that ﬂutter is associated with signiﬁcant adverse clinical outcomes. Identifying such variation may contribute toward development of targeted treatment to modify ﬂutter risk and prevent associated adverse events. Thus, we sought to determine the clinical correlates and outcomes associated with typical ﬂutter in the FHS.
Methods
The FHS is a longitudinal community-based epidemiologic cohort study initiated in 1948. The designs of the FHS Original and Offspring cohorts have been well described.13,14 In brieﬂy, 5209 individuals between 28 and 62 years of age were enrolled in 1948 to join the Original cohort. In 1971, 5124 children of the Original cohort and their spouses were recruited into the Offspring cohort. Participants were followed from their initial examinations through December 2002 for the identiﬁcation of atrial arrhythmias. All participants provided informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Boston University Medical Center.
Atrial ﬂutter ECGs were obtained from routine FHS clinic examinations, and ambulatory and hospital records. We reviewed all (n = 465) ECGs from FHS inception up to December 2002 of Original and Offspring cohorts that previously had been conﬁrmed as ﬂutter or AF/ﬂutter along with 100 random ECGs previously diagnosed as AF. Three cardiologists (PTE, SAL, PAL, EJB, or JWM), blinded to the original interpretation, independently adjudicated and classiﬁed each ECG individually as typical ﬂutter, AF, or other arrhythmia. AF was deﬁned by the absence of regular, organized atrial activity and an irregular ventricular response.8 Typical ﬂutter was deﬁned by discrete, organized atrial activity deﬁned by the presence of sawtooth pattern F waves at a rate of 240 to 340 bpm.8 We excluded individuals with prevalent AF or ﬂutter (n ¼ 3). Possible atypical ﬂutter (n ¼ 18) cases were excluded from our analyses because of distinct underlying electrophysiologic mechanisms from typical ﬂutter, the more common type of ﬂutter.12 All 100 ECGs previously

Heart Rhythm, Vol 13, No 1, January 2016
diagnosed as AF were conﬁrmed to be AF. Any disagreement between the cardiologists was resolved by joint review of the ECG.
Case referent design For each ﬂutter case, up to 5 AF and 5 referent cases were matched by age (Ϯ2 years) and sex at the same baseline examination in a nested case referent design (see Online Supplemental Figure 1). Therefore, we did not evaluate age and sex as risk factors, or sex-dependent differences in outcomes. The nested case referent design was chosen to allow for better accounting for the confounding inﬂuences of age, sex, and decade of occurrence, such as the changes in the prevalence of AF risk factors over the decades.15 When identifying AF cases to be matched, we also required that the diagnosis of AF be made at approximately the same time (Ϯ2 years) as the ﬂutter cases from the same baseline examination. Cases were described by the ﬁrst recorded ECG of incident ﬂutter or AF. Hence, Framingham participants with AF who later developed ﬂutter were categorized into the AF group and not into the ﬂutter group. No individuals with prevalent AF were included in the ﬂutter group. The referents included individuals without either ﬂutter or AF at the time of the diagnosis of the case. Baseline examination for clinical covariates was the most proximal prior examination but no more than 10 years earlier than the date of incident ﬂutter. There was no major difference in the time interval from baseline examination and event date between the groups (ﬂutter 2.4 Ϯ 2.0 years; AF 2.9 Ϯ 2.0 years; referent 2.4 Ϯ 2.0 years). When matching AF to ﬂutter cases, we required the difference in the time interval to be less than 2 years.
Clinical variables Participants in the FHS have undergone routine follow-up examinations biennially for the Original cohort and every 4 to 8 years for the Offspring cohort. In addition, cardiovascular, neurologic, and death records from outpatient visits or

hospitalizations between examination cycles are routinely sought and reviewed. At each examination, participants’ medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and blood tests were obtained.
Height and weight were measured directly and used to calculate the body mass index (weight [in kilograms] divided by height [in meters] squared). Systolic blood pressure and self-reported use of antihypertensive medication were recorded. Moderate-to-heavy alcohol use was self-reported as consuming Z7 drinks per week for women or Z14 drinks per week for men as deﬁned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.16 One drink is equivalent to approximately 12 g of alcohol. Current smoking (yes/no) was deﬁned as self-reported use of Z1 cigarette per day within the year before the FHS examination. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed if the participant used insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent, had a fasting glucose level Z126 mg/dL, or a random blood glucose Z200 mg/dL. Myocardial infarction and heart failure (HF) were diagnosed by review of hospital records and physician reports, and adjudication by 3 FHS investigators.17 Valvular heart disease was deﬁned as Zgrade III/VI systolic murmur or any diastolic murmur auscultated at an FHS examination. Heart rate was obtained from the ECG. The PR interval was measured from the beginning of the P-wave deﬂection to the end of the PR segment at the junction with the QRS complex. All covariates were obtained from the most proximal FHS examination cycle preceding the identiﬁcation of AF or ﬂutter.
We studied clinical outcomes during a follow-up period of 10 years. Outcomes evaluated included AF, myocardial infarction, HF, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Ten-year follow-up began from the date of incident ﬂutter for ﬂutter case and matched referent cases, and from the date of incident AF for AF cases. Myocardial infarction, HF, and stroke were diagnosed by review of hospital records, physician reports, and imaging and laboratory data, and adjudicated by 3 FHS investigators as described previously.17–19
Statistical analysis We related clinical covariates of smoking, moderate-toheavy alcohol use, body mass index, heart rate, PR interval, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, valvular heart disease, and history of myocardial infarction or HF to ﬂutter using (1) age- and sex-adjusted, and (2) multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression models, including all covariates noted earlier. We also compared the selected risk factors in individuals in the ﬂutter group with the referent and AF groups using conditional logistic regression models.
We examined matching sets stratiﬁed Cox proportional hazard models to relate ﬂutter to clinical outcomes, including subsequent AF, myocardial infarction, HF, stroke, and allcause mortality with adjustment for age and sex. Analyses for mortality also were adjusted for prevalent cardiovascular

235
disease. Analyses of incident outcomes were performed after exclusion of the speciﬁed disease (ie, those with prevalent disease myocardial infarction, HF, or stroke were excluded in analyses of myocardial infarction, HF, or stroke, respectively). Ten-year cumulative incidence graphs were adjusted for competing risk of death. Clinical outcomes in the ﬂutter group were compared with the referent and AF groups in separate analyses. Within each matching set, follow-up for outcomes started from the ﬂutter cases’ date of diagnosis. For all outcomes except AF, follow-up ended at outcome event or was censored at 10 years, AF diagnosis, last contact, or death, whichever came ﬁrst. With AF as the outcome, the observations were censored at the earliest of 10 years, last contact, or death. SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for analyses. A 2-sided P o .05 was considered signiﬁcant.
Results
During the cohorts’ mean follow-up of 33.0 Ϯ 12.2 years of 10,330 individuals (346,301 person-years), 126 participants developed ﬂutter, of which 112 met inclusion criteria (14 excluded with incomplete baseline examination), and 2003 individuals developed AF. The incidence rate of ﬂutter was 36 per 100,000 person-years, and the incidence rate of AF was 578 per 100,000 person years. Mean age of individuals at ﬂutter diagnosis was 72 Ϯ 10 years (range 53–92 years), and 30% were women. Baseline characteristics of the study participants included in the analyses are listed in Table 1.
In age- and sex-adjusted conditional logistic regression models, smoking, moderate-to-heavy alcohol use, higher mean PR interval, history of myocardial infarction, and history of HF were associated with incident ﬂutter compared to referents (Table 2). In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.54– 5.23, P o .001), higher mean PR interval (OR 1.28 per 1 SD [equal to 32 ms], 95% CI 1.03–1.60, P ¼ .03), history of myocardial infarction (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05–4.80, P ¼ .04), and history of HF (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26–21.64, P ¼ .02) remained statistically signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of incident ﬂutter compared to referents (Table 2). Compared with the AF group, individuals with ﬂutter were less likely to have valvular heart disease (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05–0.55, P ¼ .004) and had a longer PR interval (OR 1.38 per 1 SD [equal to 36 ms], 95% CI 1.06– 1.80, P ¼ .02) in multivariable analyses (see Online Supplemental Table 1).
Outcomes During 10-year follow-up among participants with ﬂutter, 40 developed incident AF, 12 had a myocardial infarction, 13 developed HF, 14 had a stroke, and 64 died. Table 3 lists the incidence rate per 1000 person-years for each outcome in those with ﬂutter, AF, and referents. Although based on small numbers in age- and sex-adjusted analyses, the 10-year hazard ratios for AF was increased 5-fold, myocardial infarction was increased 3-fold, HF was increased 4-fold,

and stroke and all-cause mortality were increased 2-fold in participants with ﬂutter compared with matched referents (Table 4). In comparison to participants with AF, there was no signiﬁcant difference in HF, stroke, or mortality risk, but participants with ﬂutter had an increased risk of myocardial infarction (Table 4). Figures 1 and 2 show the 10-year cumulative incidence of AF, and of myocardial infarction, HF, stroke, and mortality, respectively.
Discussion
We distinguished ﬂutter from AF to determine putative risk factors and deﬁne 10-year outcomes associated with ﬂutter in the FHS, a large, community-based cohort. In the present study, smoking, prolonged PR interval, history of myocardial infarction, and history of HF were associated with increased risk of ﬂutter compared to referents. In contrast with AF, ﬂutter compared to referents was not associated with body mass index, diabetes, or hypertension. Our ﬁndings expand on previously reported ﬂutter predictors from the Marshﬁeld Epidemiologic Study Area,6,20 which

found sex, HF, and chronic pulmonary disease as risk factors for ﬂutter and no association with diabetes or
hypertension. In our study, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
association of clinical correlates and the development of incident ﬂutter and AF except for valvular heart disease and PR interval. Previously demonstrated AF risk factors— prolonged PR interval,21,22 smoking,23 history of myocardial infarction,24 and history of HF14—were associated with ﬂutter in our study. However, valvular heart disease, a strong AF risk factor,14 was not associated with ﬂutter. Because the
predominance of valvular disorders detected on physical
examination are left-sided, major left atrial structural and
electrical remodeling from valvular disease may promote AF without promoting typical ﬂutter, a right-sided arrhythmia.25 Additionally, individuals with ﬂutter were more likely to
have a prolonged PR interval, which might promote the atrial
anatomic or functional conduction delay that is a prerequisite for a macroreentrant arrhythmia such as ﬂutter.12 Nevertheless, the overlap of risk factors of ﬂutter and AF may partially explain why patients with ﬂutter have a high risk of AF.26,27

In our analyses, we identiﬁed signiﬁcantly increased risks
for AF, myocardial infarction, HF, stroke, and mortality in FHS participants who developed ﬂutter compared to referents. Comparing ﬂutter with AF, the risk of HF, stroke, and mortality were not different. Our ﬁndings support previous
studies demonstrating that the occurrence of AF in follow-up is common in individuals with a history of ﬂutter.27,28 Similarly, the presence of left atrial appendage thrombus29 and increased risk of stroke associated with ﬂutter also have been previously described,27,30 and professional management guidelines8 for anticoagulation in ﬂutter and AF are similar. The underlying pathology of stroke in ﬂutter is
complicated, given that atrial thrombus formation is believed
to be due to lack of organized atrial activity in AF. The organized atrial activity seen in ﬂutter is associated with higher blood ﬂow velocity in the left atrial appendage31 and thus supposedly lower risk of thrombus formation.32 It is possible that ﬂutter increases stroke risk by potentiating atrial or appendage dysfunction.31 It also is possible that the increased stroke risk attributed to ﬂutter is related to the high likelihood of future or concomitant AF,33 which may go undiagnosed.34
Our data show that ﬂutter is associated with an increased
risk of myocardial infarction and HF compared with referents. A previous smaller study of ﬂutter (n ¼ 37) reported an association with coronary artery disease.35 Despite the
exclusion of preexisting HF and myocardial infarction in
our analyses of outcomes, the sequence of causality is difﬁcult to determine for ﬂutter, myocardial infarction, or
HF. The interrelations may represent a cycle, in which the presence of either ﬂutter or myocardial infarction/HF leads to
the development of the other. One hypothesis is that

asymptomatic/subclinical atherosclerosis promotes the development of the functional line of conduction block36 or slowed conduction11 that generates ﬂutter. Flutter in turn may result in localized myocardial ischemia, inﬂammation, and endothelial dysfunction promoting coronary artery disease. Other possible explanations are the overlap of risk factors between ﬂutter and myocardial infarction, or the presence of undiagnosed AF, which is also associated with a higher risk for myocardial infarction.37 Interestingly, in our study we observed an increased risk of myocardial infarction in ﬂutter compared to AF. Further investigation are needed to conﬁrm the ﬁndings, given the limited number of FHS participants with ﬂutter and myocardial infarction or HF. Furthermore, we excluded a signiﬁcant number of participants with prevalent myocardial infarction when examining the association of ﬂutter with this outcome.
Study limitations The strengths of our study include the use of a large community-based sample, rigorous ascertainment of clinical risk factors, long-term follow-up and surveillance for adverse events, and consistent event adjudication. However, there are several limitations of our investigation. The limited number of cases may constrain the statistical power of our analyses of both risk factors and 10-year outcomes, particularly regarding null ﬁndings. The ﬁndings in our study will need to be conﬁrmed in larger datasets. FHS participants are mainly white, middle-aged, older adults, so our ﬁndings may not be representative of individuals from other ethnicities, younger individuals, or other geographic areas. This is especially true because atrial arrhythmias relate to atrial size,

a factor known to vary among different racial and ethnic groups.38 AF is a common arrhythmia that is underdiagnosed
in the population, often because of its paroxysmal and sometimes minimally symptomatic nature.34 Cases identiﬁed here as referent or ﬂutter may have had unrecognized AF resulting in possible misclassiﬁcation bias. Our diagnosis of
valvular heart disease was based on clinical criteria, so there is a possibility of misclassiﬁcation. Furthermore, because of
the observational study design and small numbers of cases
we did not evaluate whether anticoagulation, electrical cardioversion, or ablative therapies modiﬁed prospective 10-year outcomes after ﬂutter onset. In addition, anticoagulation in AF and ﬂutter is known to affect prognosis.8
However during the study period, rates of anticoagulation

have been previously demonstrated to be low, and we do not have complete data on anticoagulation to evaluate its effects.
Additional studies should identify whether our data can be applied to other ethnicities and whether there exist sexdependent differences in risk factors and outcomes. Consolidation of data with other cohorts may allow identiﬁcation of additional risk factors for ﬂutter. Future studies could also evaluate whether there are differences in clinical characteristics between individuals with ﬂutter who develop AF compared to those who do not.
Conclusion
In a community-based sample, we identiﬁed risk factors associated with ﬂutter and found that ﬂutter, similar to AF,

was associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including AF, myocardial infarction, HF, and all-cause mortality. Although several common clinical factors were shared between ﬂutter and AF, our ﬁndings demonstrate differences between ﬂutter and AF consistent with a potential distinct epidemiology of ﬂutter. Future studies with larger number of cases may help conﬁrm these ﬁndings and determine how treatment of ﬂutter may reduce adversity and improve its prognosis.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES Atrial ﬂutter has often been combined with atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) in large epidemiologic studies despite having different electrophysiologic mechanisms. In this study, we examined the clinical correlates of ﬂutter and its associated adverse outcomes during a 10-year follow-up. In our study, compared with referents, participants who develop ﬂutter are more
likely to have been smokers, have a longer PR interval, history of myocardial infarction, and history of heart failure. Compared with those having AF, participants who develop ﬂutter were less likely to have valvular heart disease and had a longer PR interval. Over the subsequent 10-years after diagnosis of ﬂutter, there is an increased risk of developing AF, having a myocardial infarction, developing heart failure, having a stroke, and dying. Identiﬁcation of putative risk factors may lead to development of targeted treatment strategies to reduce the risk of ﬂutter and associated adverse outcomes.
Future studies should study whether different treatment strategies, such as medical therapy vs electrophysiologic ablation, for ﬂutter modify prognosis.
