Sensorimotor Adaptation in Speech Production 
 
John F. Houde, * dagger Michael I. Jordan 
 
Human subjects are known to adapt their motor behavior to a shift of the visual field brought about by wearing prism glasses over their eyes. The analog of this phenomenon was studied in the speech domain. By use of a device that can feed back transformed speech signals in real time, subjects were exposed to phonetically sensible, online perturbations of their own speech patterns. It was found that speakers learn to adjust their production of a vowel to compensate for feedback alterations that change the vowel's perceived phonetic identity; moreover, the effect generalizes across phonetic contexts and to different vowels.
