it has never been tested in vitro to any significant extent, nor discussed in reports on treatment trials. Other promising folate pathway antagonists have recently been tested in vitro; one in particular (WR 99210), a triazine inhibitor of dehydrofolate reductase, as well as its biguanide precursor (PS 15), exhibited excellent in vitro activity against all strains of N. asteroides sensu stricto, N. farcinica, and N. nova and warrants further investigation [25].
A recent informal poll of the membership of the Infectious Diseases Society of America inquired about nocardiosis patients who were successfully treated with nonsulfonamide drug

amikacin, or cefotaxime (or other broad-spectrum cephalosporins) alone or in various combinations; a less-ill group was treated with oral antimicrobial agents (in particular, minocycline) [9]. While the reported clinical response in most patients treated with nonsulfonamide regimens was generally favorable, these are only anecdotal data and are not comparable to those from a prospective study.
Optimal duration of therapy is uncertain, but long-term therapy is the rule because nocardial infections tend to relapse; most recommendations are empirical. In one study of the effi-
