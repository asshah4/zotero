Abstract 
 
To test the safety and efficacy of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I (rhIGF-I) in ALS, 183 patients from eight European centers were randomized to receive double-blind placebo ( n = 59) or rhIGF-I 0.1 mg/kg/day ( n = 124) subcutaneously for 9 months. At study completion, the primary efficacy outcome measure (change in disease progression as assessed by the Appel ALS rating scale) showed no significant difference between treatment groups. RhIGF-I appeared to be safe and well-tolerated.
