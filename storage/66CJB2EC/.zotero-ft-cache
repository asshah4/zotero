Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain 
Philippe Soriano

Mouse strains expressing the site-specific recombinase Cre (or Flp) facilitate conditional ablation of gene function when one or several exons of the gene of interest are flanked by loxP (or FRT) sites 1 . Cre expression achieved by classic transgenesis or targeting to an appropriate locus might be tissue specific, temporally restricted or inducible 2, 3 . In such experimental outlines, it is necessary to monitor Cre activity at desired time points as well as to verify that Cre was not active previously during development. Other investigators have generated transgenic 4, 5 or knock-in 6 lines in which lacZ expression is conditional on the removal of an intervening segment. However, such lines are most useful if lacZ can be expressed in all cell types and hence is driven off a constitutively active promoter in the mouse. 
 
We have previously described a gene-trap strain, ROSA beta geo 26, in which expression of the beta geo reporter appears to be constitutive during embryonic development 7, 8 . I report here successful targeting at the ROSA26 locus and the derivation of a reporter line for monitoring Cre expression. To target the locus, a 5-kb genomic fragment was subcloned in a plasmid vector along with a diphtheria toxin (DTA) expression cassette for negative selection to produce the vector pROSA26-1. A splice acceptor sequence (SA) identical to the one used in the original gene-trap allele, a neo expression cassette flanked by loxP sites, a lacZ gene and a polyadenylation (bpA) sequence were inserted at a unique Xba I site approximately 300-bp 5´ of the original gene-trap integration site ( Fig. 1 a ). A triple polyadenylation sequence 9 was added to the 3´ end of the neo expression cassette to prevent transcriptional read-through. This ROSA26 reporter (R26R) construct was linearized with Kpn I and electroporated into AK7 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Following G418 selection, 8 of 23 G418 r colonies were found to have correctly undergone homologous recombination by PCR and were further verified by Southern-blot analysis ( Fig. 1 b ). Three clones were used to derive germline chimaeras. Heterozygous mice did not display an overt phenotype, and were bred to obtain viable and fertile homozygous mutant progeny.

a , Top, restriction map of the locus. PCR primers from ROSA26 flanking (5´-CCTAAAGAAGAGGCTGTGCTTTGG-3´) and splice acceptor (5´-CATCAAGGAAACCCTGGACTACTG-3´) sequences were used to amplify an approximately 1.2-kb diagnostic fragment (grey arrowheads). The probe used for Southern-blot analysis is shown as a shaded box. LoxP sites are indicated by black arrowheads. Only Eco RV sites are indicated for pROSA26-R. b , Left, Southern-blot analysis of targeted clone (1-8) and wild-type (WT) DNA digested with Eco RV; 1C and 2C are populations of ES clones 1 and 2 transiently transfected with PGKCrebpA (a gift of M. Komada) showing the expected shorter targeted fragment due to deletion of the neo segment. Right, only the shorter Eco RV fragment is seen in offspring also expressing Cre (lanes 6,7) in contrast with the reporter allele alone (lane 2). ROSA26-R embryos could be genotyped by PCR (approximately 500-bp wild-type and (approximately 250-bp mutant fragments) using three oligonucleotides: 5´-AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT-3´, 5´-GCGAAGAGTTTGTCCTCAACC-3´ and 5´-GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG-3´.

The recombination efficiency will depend on the level of Cre expression and thus vary between different mouse strains. Heterozygous R26R mice were bred with R26Cre mice, a general deletor mouse line made by targeting Cre to the ROSA26 locus, and embryos were collected at various stages between embryonic day (E) 8 and E16 and stained with X-Gal for lacZ activity. Embryos heterozygous for both R26Cre and R26R alleles displayed ubiquitous blue staining, whereas wild-type or heterozygous R26R embryos did not show any staining ( Fig. 2 ). These results indicate that the reporter line functions as planned and that following recombination at preimplantation, at which time the ROSA26 promoter is activated 7 , lacZ can be expressed in all cells of the embryo. Crossing R26R mice with other Cre-expressing strains resulted in different or more restricted lacZ expression patterns (data not shown). The R26R mouse strain should be of wide use for monitoring Cre expression, as well as for analysing cell lineages during development, and is available from the Induced Mutant Resource of the Jackson Laboratory (stock numbers 3309 and 3310). Another reporter mouse line has been generated at the BT5 gene-trap locus using a similar approach (S.K. Michael and E.J. Robertson, pers. comm.). Although the ROSA26 promoter has been shown to have activity on its own and might lead to broad gene expression in transgenic mice 8 , the high rate of homologous recombination and generalized lacZ expression observed here suggest that targeting of genes to the ROSA 26 locus may be a desirable method to achieve ubiquitous expression during development or in the adult.
