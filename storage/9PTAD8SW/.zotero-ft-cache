OBJECTIVES Emotional intelligence (EI) involves the perception, processing, regulation and management of emotions. This article aims to systematically review the evidence for EI in medicine through the context of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies.
METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for Englishlanguage articles published between January 1980 and March 2009. The grey literature was also searched and experts in the ﬁeld contacted for additional studies. Two independent reviewers selected articles which reported empirical research studies about clinicians or medical students. Conceptual articles and opinion pieces and commentaries were excluded. Information about the measure used to assess EI, the study parameter or domain, and the educational or clinical

outcome (with speciﬁc relation to the ACGME competencies) was extracted.
RESULTS The literature search identiﬁed 485 citations. An abstract review led to the retrieval of 24 articles for full-text assessment, of which 16 articles were included in the ﬁnal review. Eleven studies focused on postgraduates, four on undergraduates and one on medical school applicants. Six out of seven studies found women to have higher EI than men. Higher EI was reported to positively contribute to the doctor–patient relationship (three studies), increased empathy (ﬁve studies), teamwork and communication skills (six studies), and stress management, organisational commitment and leadership (three studies).
CONCLUSIONS Measures of EI correlate with many of the competencies that modern medical curricula seek to deliver. Further research is required to determine whether training can improve EI and thus augment educational and clinical outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Medical education aims to cultivate doctors with a broad range of skills which will ultimately enable them to provide patient care that is clinically sound and emotionally responsive.1,2 In order to improve and streamline this endeavour, there has been an increased drive to deﬁne and assess the core characteristics of professional competence.3 Subsequently, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in the USA has deﬁned six core competencies that constitute the hallmarks of graduate medical education: Patient Care; Professionalism; Systems-based Practice; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; Medical Knowledge, and Practice-based Learning and Improvement. Each competency can be measured and mapped to clinical indicators of outcome and performance. Understanding of the underlying attributes of these competencies is required to foster educational strategies that will promote their development and thus improve patient care.4
Many of the skills that contribute towards these competencies are thought to be underpinned by emotional intelligence (EI).5 Emotional intelligence is an individual characteristic that reﬂects the ‘ability to monitor one’s own and others’ emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions’.6 It is thought to capture how people manage their own and other people’s emotions.7 Emotional intelligence is a psychological ‘construct’: it has been developed conceptually to represent a characteristic in which individuals differ (much like motor skill, intelligence and neuroticism). The construct has been subsequently used in empirical research to show how best to measure EI and, more importantly, whether EI matters in professional and educational contexts, including clinical practice and education. Although the ﬁeld has grown rapidly over the past 15 years, there is currently heated debate regarding the nature of EI and how best to measure it. Although summarising the entire ﬁeld is beyond the scope of this current review, it is important to outline the state of the debate. This is instrumental in situating our work amongst the current state of the art in the conceptual development of EI, as well as in the empirical evidence base that supports it. Our exposition is based on a recent theoretical analysis of EI by Cherniss.8 It is also informed by a critical review of the literature from a medical viewpoint by Lewis et al.9

A ﬁrst point to consider in this matter is: what is EI? Various deﬁnitions, conceptualisations and measures exist in the psychological and other literatures, such that the non-expert reader is often at a loss to grasp the underlying construct. Such confusions are present in relation to whether EI actually exists (i.e. a validity issue) and, if it does, whether it is a unitary or a multi-dimensional construct, whether it can be modiﬁed and, therefore, whether training in EI makes sense, and whether EI should be viewed as the static ‘property’ of an individual or in a more contextdependent, ‘dynamic’ manner.9 On the minimal assumption that EI exists (in some form), there is further debate in the psychological literature on whether EI is an ability or a personality trait. Early conceptualisations of EI referred to it as an ability – hence the usage of the term ‘intelligence’. Some researchers have deﬁned it as a type of social intelligence;10 others have maintained that it is a mental ability, much like cognitive ability, that reﬂects the efﬁcacy of affective information processing,11 and yet others have treated it as encompassing various social and emotional competencies.12 Within the framework of EI as an ability, EI captures individuals’ ability to understand and process affective information. This framework has been challenged recently by researchers who maintain that EI is a personality trait rather than a form of intelligence.13 Within this framework of EI as a trait, EI captures personality facets and dispositions related to emotions.
This distinction between, and the ensuing debate on, the conceptualisations of EI as an ability and EI as a trait are important because they have determined the approaches taken to EI measurement and assessment.8 If EI is an ability, there ought to be objective tests that capture that ability. If, however, EI is a personality trait, then objective assessment of it is by deﬁnition impossible. Some ability EI theorists have assessed EI via self-report questionnaires, such as Bar-On’s Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i).10 (Bar-On’s conceptualisation of EI clearly illustrates the confusion we referred to earlier. In Bar-On’s model, it is not clear whether EI is treated as an ability or as a personality trait.10 Lewis et al. capture this confusion nicely by describing this model of EI as including ‘an array of skills, abilities and personality traits, clustered together under four of ﬁve organising domains’.9 As we argue later in this paper, an ability conceptualisation of EI paired with a self-report measure of the construct is inherently problematic because it does not allow for maximal performance in terms of objective scoring.)

Although it is widely used, the EQ-i is problematic because an ability cannot, by deﬁnition, be captured solely by self-report (i.e. there is no objective metric). In addition, EQ-i scores do not correlate well with other measures of cognitive ability. To overcome some of these problems, the Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) attempts to capture emotional ability objectively.11 The MSCEIT uses expert and consensus scoring to assess participants’ performance. Neither approach, however, is without problems because individual differences in the way people perceive emotional information cannot be easily deemed ‘erroneous’ by either an expert judge or a panel of judges. Moreover, the test has been criticised as being a knowledge test, rather than an ability test. Furthermore, the MSCEIT does not correlate well with the EQ-i. With regard to the popularised Goleman model, there is also the Emotional Competence Inventory, a tool based upon self-report and 360-degree assessment.15 However, evidence on the reliability and validity of this tool is limited16 and questions arise as to whether it truly measures what it purports to measure (i.e. EI.)9 Finally, from the perspective of personality, Petrides’ Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) captures EI via subjective self-report.13 Although the TEIQue has good psychometric properties, it potentially suffers from its sole reliance on self-report (no objective metrics are available).
These conceptual disagreements and methodological disparities notwithstanding, outside health care, EI has been linked to academic success, increased productivity and job satisfaction.17 Within medicine, EI is thought to be equally important, especially in view of the careful management of emotions required in daily patient care and practice. In particular, EI-related abilities or personal dispositions are considered to be key to sound doctor–patient and team-working relationships.18,19 For example, good emotional understanding may involve listening to a tired and frustrated colleague’s angry tirade without taking it personally, or trying to focus on what is best for the patient rather than on ‘who is right’. Emotional intelligence might be equally important in professionalism and systems-based practice. For example, admitting that an error has been made and being open about it to a patient or a patient’s family involves signiﬁcant management of one’s own feelings, as well as of the emotional response of the patient and his or her family, and one’s colleagues.
As medical education strives to produce doctors with these characteristics, it is timely that educators consider the emotional aspects of competence and

reﬂect on how these actually inﬂuence outcomes. Here, we report a systematic review of the literature with the primary aim of determining the relationship of EI to the ACGME competencies with a speciﬁc focus upon educational and clinical outcomes.
METHODS
Data sources
The databases of MEDLINE (1950–March 2009), EMBASE (1980–March 2009), PsycINFO (1987– 2009), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Terms used included each of the following keywords: ‘medi*’, ‘surg*’, ‘clinic*’, ‘physician$’ and ‘health care’. These were combined with the term ‘emotional intelligence’. We did not specify the term ‘education’ at this stage as we wanted to pick up all studies that related to EI and medicine. This increased the sensitivity of our search, allowing us to focus upon the relevant articles later. In addition, we hand-searched the reference lists of all retrieved articles for further papers as well as conference proceedings from relevant meetings. We also contacted experts in the ﬁeld for unpublished studies. We limited our results to English-language studies conducted upon humans, published between the years 1980 and 2009.
Study selection and inclusion and exclusion criteria
Two authors (SA, HA) independently reviewed the abstracts of all articles identiﬁed by our search criteria (n = 485) for potential inclusion in the review. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. The two authors initially disagreed about whether to include or exclude ﬁve of the 485 abstracts. The full text for these ﬁve abstracts was retrieved for discussion and decisions were made jointly with a third author (NS). All ﬁve of these abstracts were excluded as they did not specify any clinicians in the sample. In order to achieve the same degree of speciﬁcity as sensitivity, a standardised set of inclusion criteria was formulated. These inclusion criteria required papers to be empirical data articles related to health care only (speciﬁcally to clinicians or medical students). Articles focusing exclusively upon patients, nurses or members of other professions were excluded. We also excluded reviews, general opinion pieces, commentaries and letters. After applying these criteria, duplicates were removed, leaving the remaining articles to be retrieved for full-text review. Two authors (SA, HA) independently examined each of

these articles for inclusion. This protocol identiﬁed the articles to be included in the ﬁnal review.
Data abstraction
Data extraction from each article was conducted by two authors; disagreements were resolved by consensus. A standardised abstraction form was utilised, which included information on the following: study population and specialty; study design; aspect of EI; measure of EI, and outcome measure. The heterogeneity of obtained study designs ruled out a formal meta-analysis. Instead, two authors (SA, HA) categorised the studies according to the themes that emerged from the literature (by consensus). These were then matched to one or more of the relevant ACGME competencies. Deﬁnitions from the ACGME and information obtained through the abstraction criteria were used in order to match the two constructs.
Assessment of study quality
We developed our own assessment of study quality for the purpose of this review. This is because no single ‘hierarchy’ of the quality of evidence exists which is applicable across all research methodologies and topics20 and most of the checklists currently available have been developed for assessing randomised controlled trials (e.g. the Jadad scale21). Moreover, most quality assessment scales22 do not pertain speciﬁcally to studies of a descriptive nature (like those in our review). Our assessment criteria for quantitative studies in this review were based upon existing, generally acceptable guidelines and recommendations (e.g. MOOSE23 [meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology] Guidelines, the QUOROM Statement24 and the Consort Statement checklist25). For the qualitative studies in the review, our quality assessment was developed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREC) checklist as a framework.26
Scoring items in the assessment scales
In accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration’s recommendations,27 we evaluated the quality of the studies by assessing on a 3-point ordinal scale the extent to which the items on the quality checklist were met by each of the papers. Each criterion or item was deﬁnitely met, partially met or deﬁnitely not met. Table S1 provides comprehensive information on how the quality scoring was completed. It is important to note that the aim of performing the quality check was not to exclude papers on the basis

of ‘low’ quality scores; rather, it was to provide an idea of the quality of the empirical data currently available.

RESULTS
We retrieved 485 citations from the systematic search strategy. After application of our inclusion criteria, 38 abstracts remained. Excellent agreement between the two raters who reviewed each article for inclusion was obtained (j = 0.74). The removal of 14 duplicates led to the retrieval of 24 full-text articles for assessment. Of these, 16 articles were subsequently identiﬁed for ﬁnal inclusion in the review (Fig. 1).
Quality assessment
Table 1 displays the quality assessment scores for included papers. Once again, there was an excellent level of agreement between the two raters using the quality assessment scale (j = 0.80). None of the quantitative studies (n = 14) ‘deﬁnitely met’ all quality assessment criteria. However, nine of the papers met six out of 10 criteria and all the papers met at least four out of 10 criteria (more detailed methodological evaluations are available in

Table S1). Only one (of a total of n = 2) qualitative study could be assessed on the basis of quality.28 This paper met 10 of 14 assessment criteria. The other paper29 focused on a discussion of the authors’ interpretation of ﬁndings and gave very limited information on the study’s methodology or results; for this reason this paper was excluded from quality analysis.
Study characteristics
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies. Regarding study design and methodology, the vast majority of reviewed studies were surveybased, employing self-report EI questionnaires (n = 14). Most of these studies were cross-sectional and only one30 was longitudinal. Other methodological approaches included the use of objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)-style tasks and correlation of performance with EI scores in one study1 and interview methodology in two studies.28,29 Study populations included medical undergraduates (four of 16 studies)1,30–32 and medical school applicants.33 The remaining 11 studies focused upon postgraduates: six examined solely clinicians, including surgical34 and anaesthesiology35 residents, as well as doctors from various specialties.28,36–38 The ﬁve remaining postgraduate studies included other members of the multidisciplinary team (as well as doctors).29,44,47,51,57
How EI was measured
As we highlighted in the Introduction, if we are to understand and apply EI, we must ﬁrst be able to measure it in a robust, comprehensive manner. Our review revealed that this is not the case at present in medicine, thereby replicating the pattern of disagreement around EI found outside medicine.8 Table 2 demonstrates the range of measures used at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It shows there were signiﬁcant variations in the choice of tool used to assess EI across the reviewed studies. Of the 14 studies employing EI questionnaires, three34–36 used the Bar-On EQ-i,10 two31,32 used a revised version of Schutte et al.’s questionnaire,39 two1,30 used the Trait Meta Mood Scale,40 and two37,38 used the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS).41 Many other tools were used in only one study each. Although there is some evidence on reliability and validity, there remains much controversy regarding the measurement instruments used in these studies, which must be borne in mind when interpreting results. For example, the Schutte Selfreport Emotional Intelligence Test39 (used by two

studies) does have a high internal consistency reliability (r = 0.90),42 but may lack discriminant validity and appears to be unrelated to general intelligence.43
The more popular Bar-On EQ-i10 also has uncertain content validity as it reports personality traits that are not widely considered to be abilities and omits certain elements of EI, such as emotion perception and understanding.8 It does, however, display excellent reliability (internal consistency) of 0.97 and correlates well with other self-report measures.10 In the studies reported within this review, all the tools utilised were based on participants’ self-reporting of facets of their own EI. This raises its own issues, including that of reliance on people’s subjective judgements of their own abilities (with particular application to the EQ-i); in fact it could be argued that the poorer someone’s emotional understanding is, the more likely it is that his subjective judgement of himself will be inaccurate.
Effect of gender on EI
Of the four studies investigating medical students, three found that females had higher EI than males.30–32 A study by Carrothers et al.33 of applicants to medical schools also found that their female population scored higher on EI. Similarly, OginskaBulik44 studied human service professionals and found that women had signiﬁcantly higher EI, although Wagner et al.36 found this effect in clinicians on only one subscale of EI, namely, stress management.
Effect of age and experience on EI
One study in the undergraduate literature30 compared the EI of medical students in their third year with that in their ﬁrst year and found it to be signiﬁcantly decreased in the latter years. Within the clinician population, two studies37,38 found a positive correlation between EI and age or experience, thus suggesting that EI increases as one progresses through one’s career. By contrast, Wagner et al.36 found no differences in EI scores between faculty members and more junior doctors. Finally, in a study of surgical residents,34 neither resident age nor level of training correlated with EI.
The doctor–patient relationship and EI
The doctor–patient relationship represents an inherent part of the Patient Care, Professionalism, Systems-based Practice, and Interpersonal and Communication Skills competencies outlined by the

ACGME. Given the emphasis that EI places upon
recognising and managing emotions, this may help
to explain why some doctors are more able to provide better patient-centred care.45 Within this
review, three studies of postgraduates examined the components of this relationship with EI.36–38 Two studies by Weng et al.37,38 found that doctors’ EI

positively correlated with patients’ trust, which in turn correlated with better patient follow-up, better doctor–patient relationships and increased satisfaction with both the doctor and hospital. Wagner et al.36 compared doctors who achieved 100% patient satisfaction with those who achieved < 100% satisfaction and found a signiﬁcant difference only

in the ‘happiness’ subscale of EI. This lack of ﬁndings in other subscales could be attributed to the small sample size of 30, particularly as the study was powered to detect only large effects.36 In addition, there was a wide disparity in the sample population (i.e. the doctors included ranged in age from 26 to 52 years).36 In line with other evidence stating that expert clinicians have a greater appreciation of the sensitive nature of the doctor–patient relationship46 and therefore are more likely to generate higher rates of patient satisfaction, the inclusion of senior doctors in this sample may have acted as a potential confounder.
Empathy and EI
Empathy is an inherent component of several of the ACGME competencies. Being compassionate

underpins good Patient Care, Professionalism, and
Interpersonal and Communication Skills. Accurately
‘reading’ and managing emotions is a crucial
process in being aware of the feelings of others.
Not surprisingly, therefore, empathy is regarded as an inherent facet of EI.31 Four studies examined EI or empathy in medical students1,30–32 and
another investigated the same qualities in health care managers.32 Women were found to score more highly than men in empathy1,30,32 and overall EI.1,30,32 However, only one study directly compared EI and empathy skills18 and found that the two signiﬁcantly correlated.31 It is important to note
that in both this study and another by Austin et al.,32 students within the sample were self-
selected. This could introduce bias through the
self-selection for inclusion of those who are more
able. Furthermore, the results were based upon

S Arora et al
self-report questionnaires, which, although they reported adequate reliabilities, did not allow for the detailed exploration of the subject area that might have been achieved with parallel interviews.
The role of EI in teamwork, communication and interpersonal skills
Teamwork and communication are an essential component of Systems-based Practice. Moreover, Interpersonal and Communication Skills constitute a speciﬁc ACGME competency themselves and are postulated to be directly related to EI.18 All four studies that examined EI in conjunction with the communication and interpersonal skills of undergraduates1,31–33 found signiﬁcant positive correlations between the two domains. These included communication skills in a medical school entrance interview,33 students’ attitudes to ‘talking with families’31 and communication skills as assessed by patients in an OSCE setting.1 Two studies examined EI and teamwork in the postgraduate literature.29,47 McCallin and Bamford29 interviewed 44 health professionals and found that high levels of EI were associated with better team behaviour and performance. However, this study especially lacks methodological detail; no information on sampling strategy, the interview questions or the reliability of the ‘grounded theory’ analysis used was provided.29 As only one person analysed the interview transcripts, the ﬁndings could be based solely upon that person’s own subjective interpretation. Member-checking or the use of another coder might have overcome this limitation. Amundson’s study of health care teams47 also showed signiﬁcant correlations between group EI and team effectiveness. However, this study included non-clinicians, which makes it difﬁcult to extrapolate ﬁndings to a purely clinical population.
EI and academic performance
Emotional intelligence training may improve clinical diagnostic and prognostic abilities as well as the doctor–patient relationship.48 It is therefore possible that EI is implicated in the ACGME competency of Medical Knowledge. Evidence from outside health care suggests that higher EI is potentially associated with various facets of academic performance, most notably those involving emotions and emotional processing.49 All three studies within this review that investigated the association of EI with performance in medical examinations were conducted in undergraduates.31–33 One found no association between EI and end-of-year marks of medical students.32

However, another study by Austin et al.31 in ﬁrst-year students found a positive and signiﬁcant relationship between EI and examination performance on a speciﬁc course component (a health and society module), but not on the biomedical sciences module. Carrothers et al.33 also found that the EI scores of medical school applicants correlated positively with the interview assessment designed to test interpersonal skills. This is an important study as it was amongst the ﬁrst to report the use of EI within the selection process, albeit on a pilot basis.33 However, the lack of longitudinal data prevents the drawing of conclusions on whether the ﬁndings remained stable during medical school and beyond.
The role of EI in workplace stress, leadership and organisational commitment
In addition to EI in individuals, there is also the concept of the ‘emotionally intelligent organisation’,45 which pertains to the emotional culture or climate of the workplace. In this respect, EI relates to the competencies of Practice-based Learning and Improvement, and Systems-based Practice. For example, accurately regulating one’s emotional response may be important in mitigating the impact of stress and burnout.50 In a study of front-line care workers, EI signiﬁcantly correlated with both coping ability and organisational commitment.51 Another study by Oginska-Bulik44 demonstrated a signiﬁcant negative relationship between EI and depression, as well as stress in the workplace. Both these studies, however, relied upon self-report and included non-clinicians, which raises questions about the generalisability of their results to a purely clinical population.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review of the evidence on EI in relation to modern doctor training. With speciﬁc reference to the ACGME competencies, the review revealed a plethora of potential applications of EI to medical education. These range from the more direct link between EI and Interpersonal and Communication Skills to indirect applications, such as links between EI and Practice-based Learning and Improvement. The evidence base showed that higher EI is positively associated with more compassionate and empathetic patient care (Patient Care), higher-scoring assessments of knowledge (Medical Knowledge), and effective coping with organisational pressures and leadership (Practice-based Learning and Improve-

Emotional intelligence in medicine

ment, and Systems-based Practice). Furthermore, EI also contributed to improved teamwork and doctor– patient communication (Interpersonal and Communication Skills, and Professionalism).
These ﬁndings are exciting and novel. However, they should be evaluated in the context of the limitations of the existing evidence. Firstly, we were surprised to ﬁnd that the evidence base is rather slim: the present review covered material published in 16 peer-reviewed reports. Of these, three articles contained a sample population that was not limited to doctors (e.g. including managers), thus making it difﬁcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions from these results. It is interesting that there is much more talk than robust empirical work around EI: opinion pieces calling for more research on EI and its implications for doctors’ skills and competencies far outnumber relevant research reports. A ﬁrst conclusion that emerges from this review is that further, systematic empirical research on EI is needed to address this limitation.
A second, related limitation of the evidence base concerns the proliferation of EI measures in the published reports, with a corresponding lack of standardisation. The present review identiﬁed nine different EI assessment tools used in 14 studies. Although EI-related research in the context of health care is novel and standardisation potentially risks stiﬂing innovative research approaches, the anarchy in tool usage is in fact a greater risk. From a slightly different perspective, we think it is rather interesting that the development of the EI evidence base in medicine has closely followed that in the non-medical ﬁelds. These unresolved disagreements on the nature of the underlying construct have led to multiple, often conﬂicting, approaches to EI assessment, which is exactly what we found in medicine. Psychometric robustness tends to be mixed for the tools used. Like the EQ-i10 (the problems of which were discussed earlier), evidence on the validity of Schutte’s scale39 is mixed (and the versions used in the studies we found were modiﬁed42,43), and the WLEIS41 has not been used enough in the literature to draw ﬁrm conclusions.
A ﬁnal limitation of the evidence base concerns the fact that although the ACGME-based competencies provide a useful framework in which to situate the educational and clinical outcomes, it should be noted that many EI-related behaviours did not fall neatly under a single competency, but were more widely applicable across the competencies. Although it

might perhaps be na¨ıve to expect complex competencies to cluster neatly around equally complex facets of clinicians’ personality or ability set, we believe that the lack of standardisation in the assessment of EI addressed earlier is a likely contributor to this pattern. Without agreed deﬁnitions and measures, the medical education community will ﬁnd it hard to link individuals’ characteristics with competency development and achievement, which emphasises the need for greater clarity in the research approach.
These limitations notwithstanding, the present review shows that EI measures relate to a wide range of competencies that modern medical training curricula seek to deliver. The pervasive link between EI and doctor competence carries signiﬁcant implications for medical training. A ﬁrst, immediate implication would be to educate doctors in EI-related skills to better achieve their required competencies, which echoes calls in the literature for training in the psychosocial aspects of care.52 Moreover, the EI components provide an evidence-based classiﬁcation of the type of non-technical skills that medical training has traditionally found hard to address and incorporate into the standard curriculum.46 Importantly, the EI theory and tools also offer a vocabulary for the provision of systematic feedback to trainees, which might enable them to make the most of learning opportunities and interaction with their senior peers.
Further work should seek to achieve higher levels of conceptual and methodological clarity regarding EI deﬁnition and assessment.45 It is important to note that ‘a particular theoretical model of EI can be measured in more than one way’;8 thus seeking a ‘one-size-ﬁts-all’ approach may not be the most suitable way of dealing with the issue. This is not a call for methodological anarchy. Rather, we recommend that a clear choice of a conceptual framework of EI be made, followed by careful selection of a relevant tool that assesses EI as deﬁned within the framework of choice. This will render the medical education literature much more consistent. It will also allow for the build-up of an evidence base such that the efﬁcacy of different tools and theoretical approaches can be compared systematically in the future, with the ultimate aim of assessing their validity. With regard to EI as a ‘trait’, tools that have appeared more recently in the literature, particularly the TEIQue,13 should receive more attention. The TEIQue has good psychometric properties,13 correlates with nontechnical skills,54 is sensitive in capturing training effects on EI55 and, ﬁnally, has shown adaptability

across countries and cultures.56 Of all the ability measures, the MSCEIT appears to have the greatest degree of content validity as it conforms most closely to the basic deﬁnition of EI.8 Furthermore, its test– retest and internal consistency reliabilities are sufﬁciently high (0.75–0.86).42 Future application of this tool to a clinical population alongside other measures of EI and personality would help to establish its concurrent and discriminant validity within medicine. Careful choice of EI assessment tools and their consistent application across specialties will allow for the construction of a more robust evidence base on the role of EI in medicine.
With appropriately clear, theory-driven tool selection, further work should also seek to clarify the role of EI in all stages of medical training, including its predictive validity. More empirical work is also required to determine the correlation of EI with clinical and academic performance. This would pave the way for a coherent approach to its integration in the medical curricula. Finally, further research would involve extending study designs to include additional longitudinal studies. A conspicuous lack of these to date has meant that medical educators have been unable to assess the impact of clinical training on EI skills. Such studies are required in health care to determine whether EI really matters and, if so, how best to improve trainees’ EI, their competencies as doctors and, subsequently, patient care, which is, of course, the ultimate aim of medical education.
CONCLUSIONS
Emotional intelligence correlates with many of the core competencies that modern medical curricula seek to deliver. The potential application of EI as a pedagogical tool into medical education offers a new approach to improving both educational and clinical outcomes.
