Psychosocial Aspects of Sudden Death
A Preliminary Report
William A. Greene, MD; Sidney Goldstein, MD; and Arthur J. Moss, MD, Rochester, NY

Meaningful information was available on 26 patients who died suddenly in a 44,000 industrial population. The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psy-
chosocial information were obtained from
the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a
week up to several months. The sudden
death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt tran-
sition from one such state to another may
produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems,
as well as central nervous system mediated
behavior, which are conducive to the sudden
death.

The focus of my presentation is psychological variables in rela¬ tion to sudden death. The patients whom I describe have already been
described in some detail in Gold¬
stein's presentation1 since the pre¬ hospital trio involved in the study of myocardial infarction at a pictur¬ esque industrial plant in Rochester, NY, includes Dr. Goldstein, Dr. Moss, and myself. My own main concern has been with psychosocial variables in both the on-work part of the study (those employees reporting to the in¬ dustrial plant medical facility with symptoms indicating a myocardial in¬ farction) and the so-called off-work part of the study (those reporting to nonplant medical facilities such as personal physicians, hospital emer¬ gency, or ambulance call). These two groups comprise all those with symp¬ toms of suspect or actual myocardial infarction who get to the hospital alive. The study of this total indus¬ trial population also includes those

who die suddenly, within 24 hours of onset of significant development or change of symptoms.
My interest in these psychosocial aspects evolved during a study with Dr. Moss of the adjustment of pa¬ tients with cardiac pacemakers in the
course of which we took note of psy¬
chological factors occurring in rela¬ tion to the onset of symptoms at the time of development of varying de¬
grees of heart block with dizziness or
syncope. In many, the symptoms of
heart block developed in psychologi¬ cally distressful situations, chiefly those of depression.2 A later investi¬ gation, undertaken with the cardiol¬ ogists four years ago, of patients with heart disease, congenital and ac¬ quired, subjected to cardiac catheterization, showed differences in behav¬
ioral reactions to the threat of the
catheterization procedure which could
be correlated with variations in corti¬
sol and growth hormone changes.3
Such behavioral and hormonal differ¬
ences in turn have recently been
shown to be correlated with sub¬
sequent morbidity and mortality, es¬ pecially in relation to cardiac sur¬ gery.4 I have also had a long background of interest in problems pertaining to the psychophysiology of the cardiovascular system, having

been trained under George Engel, MD, whose early investigation of the psychophysiologic aspects of fainting
are well known.16
Dr. Engel has recently published
papers which describe a series of cases of sudden death which he has
gleaned from newspaper reports.
From these accounts, he identified a
number of types of dramatic life set¬ tings in which sudden death may oc¬ cur. Most involved intense displea¬
sure, as with the loss of a beloved per¬
son or conditions of profound anxiety, but a few reflected intense pleasure, as with a happy ending. Common to all was that the events were impos¬ sible for the victim to ignore and they responded with overwhelming excita¬ tion or giving up or both. He proposed that this combination may provoke neurovegetative responses, reflecting psychologic as well as physiologic un¬ certainty and involving both ergotrophic and trophotrophic systems which
may be conducive to lethal cardiac
events, especially in individuals with preexisting cardiac disease.7¦' Part of my interest in studying in detail the patients in the Eastman Kodak Com¬ pany population who have sudden
deaths has been to determine whether there was any truth to what
Dr. Engel has been reading in the pa¬ pers, or perhaps more correctly, whether there was any appropriate¬ ness to the interpretations he was reading into what he was reading in
the papers.
Material and Methods
Methods.—First should be mentioned our
method of obtaining psychosocial data per¬ taining to these patients who have died acutely. It has already been pointed out by Dr. Goldstein1 and will be pointed out fur¬ ther by Dr. Moss9 that the past illness data, as well as the prodromal pathophysiologic data on these patients, were ob¬ tained from the Eastman Kodak Company physicians as well as from the patients' private physicians, either by Dr. Moss or Dr. Goldstein. My role in the study has been to obtain data on psychological and social changes in juxtaposition to an actual

myocardial infarction, episodes of pro¬ longed ischemia from surviving hospi¬ talized patients or from next-of-kin rela¬ tives of sudden death patients. Such psy¬
chosocial data is sometimes referred to as
"soft." It has been my contention in my
participation with Dr. Moss and Dr. Gold¬ stein, as well as the other cardiologists at
this medical center with whom I have
worked, that psychological and social data
can be as reliable as are a great deal of the so-called hard data, such as estimates of
the severity of a myocardial infarction at the time certain very sophisticated mea¬ surements of pathophysiological variables are now being made. One need not be de¬ fensive about the softness of psychological data appropriately gathered, and it may be
germane to be offensive at times about
the fuzziness of many pertinent variables measuring the variations of pathophysiology in patients with a myocardial in¬
farction.
Studies of sudden death have been made
by a number of types of data-gathering
methods1"12 and some details of our meth¬
ods should be described. Reports go to the industrial plant visiting nurses of persons who are out ill with any type of disease, and those with symptoms suggestive of a myocardial infarction are reported to this prehospital investigative group. The
nurses also learn within 24 hours any cir¬
cumstances of sudden death, either in the plant or out of the plant. These are re¬ ported to the prehospital study center and to me specifically.
Since the patient has died before the case is brought to our attention, the prob¬ lem is whom one should approach in refer¬
ence to the circumstances of the sudden
death and questions about prodromal
symptoms and emotional state of the pa¬
tient and the family dynamics in the days, weeks, or months preceding the event.
Sometimes one assumes that under such
circumstances, as in many situations, it
would be better if a woman did the inter¬
viewing of the responsible surviving rela¬ tive (so far always the wife in our series), while at other times it would seem prefer¬
able that it be a man who does this. When
it is difficult or impossible to make up one's
mind about such a matter, it may be desir¬
able to use both approaches. Fortunately,
we are in a situation where both a woman,
a nurse, and a man, a physician, interview
in all cases.
The visiting nurse makes a courtesy call

at the funeral home at the time of the fu¬
neral of the deceased, making a contact with the widow whom she frequently al¬ ready knows because nearly all patients
had been sick with cardiovascular disease
in the past. Along with condolences, the nurse makes arrangements for a repeat
call on the widow sometime in the sub¬
sequent week, mainly for the purpose of considering such things as insurance and
benefits.
Within 24 hours of the sudden death, the prehospital investigation center is noti¬ fied. Then a contact is made by me with the nurse to ascertain the plans for the funeral arrangements and when she will probably
visit the spouse. The nurse later visits the
spouse approximately a week after the fu¬ neral. Following that visit, I reconnoiter with the nurse, who has gleaned consid¬
erable information about the reaction of
the spouse, as well as the spouse's descrip¬ tion of the circumstances of sudden death, her degree of grief, and in particular, who she is angry at: fate, herself, the company, or not infrequently, the patient.
The nurses are very perceptive and fre¬ quently have had considerable association with the particular patient's family be¬ cause of his previous cardiovascular symp¬ toms related to an earlier infarction, an¬ gina, or hypertension. They informally
obtain information about the circum¬
stances, particularly the matter of prodro¬ mal or lack of prodromal symptomatology, as well as family make-up and conflicts. They also get information which is related to them by the spouse regarding the cir¬ cumstances of the patient's demise. The nurses indicate that there is a special study being conducted by doctors from Strong Memorial Hospital and the Roches¬ ter General Hospital and that Dr. Greene will likely be in contact with them about the circumstances of the patient's final ill¬
ness.
Initially, we had some qualms about how readily these widows would accept what might be an intrusive inquiry into the cir¬ cumstances surrounding the death of their husbands. Usually between the 10th and 15th day after the death of the patient, I make a telephone call to the home, having obtained the address and telephone num¬ ber from the nurses and also having called the deceased's physician and also the wife's physician, where this is different, and obtained their acquiescence. When I call the spouse, I identify myself by name,

as coming from Strong Memorial Hospital, and as NOT having anything to do with the Eastman Kodak Company so that she can feel free to talk about her perception of the patient's possible work stress or dis¬ satisfactions. I explain our general study of patients with actual or suspected heart attacks and particularly our interest in those who have died suddenly. The spouse is then given the opportunity either to re¬ fuse or for me to meet with her directly for an interview at her home, in my office, or over the telephone, the preference of all of them so far. Much to our surprise, these spouses have been only too willing to talk about the circumstances leading up to their
husbands' deaths. Some of this I am sure is
motivated by their current grief and their
wish to talk over the situation with some¬
one. I should point out that I have had long experience and toleration in interviewing people in grieving situations and obtaining psychological data. During such data gath¬ ering I may be therapeutically supportive, I think, without contaminating appre¬ ciably the information obtained. Most of
the widows indicate their wish to go over the circumstances of the death of their
spouse with the idea that it may be of benefit to someone else. Some of their par¬
ticipation is obviously motivated by their need to express their sadness and, at times, their fury at the plant, at the per¬ sonal physician, at fate, and, not in¬ frequently, at the patient whom they may describe in various ways as stupid and stubborn at not having gone to a physician sooner. It has been surprising how many of these women indicate, at least after the fact, that they had assumed and felt for days or weeks that the patient was going to have another myocardial infarction and frequently they had predicted the several circumstances in which this might occur.
We had assumed that the emotional dis¬
tress of the relative would be a problem in conducting these interviews. The inter¬
views are semi-structured and include es¬
sentially the same information that is ob¬ tained in interviews of patients who develop actual or suspected infarctions, turn in on-work or off-work, and are inter¬ viewed directly in the hospital. Rather than being reluctant, the spouse has usu¬ ally been very willing to talk and the prob¬ lem has been one of terminating the inter¬
view after an hour or more. The extent to
which these widows are able to talk, at times with considerable distress, but with

reasonable coping resources has been quite touching. Particularly this seems so since they talk to someone that they do not know over the telephone. It may be that this mode of interview data gathering has cer¬ tain advantages, as well as some dis¬ advantages and may engender positive or negative contaminating influences on the validity of the information obtained.
Subjects.—The particular patients about whom I am reporting today include the 22
sudden deaths that Dr. Goldstein' has al¬
ready referred to, and an additional four patients. Two of these were deaths onwork prior to our beginning the total work study in June of 1970 and were sudden deaths on-work during 1969 after the onwork phase began in December 1968. An¬ other additional patient was in the onwork study when he developed a severe myocardial infarction and survived but then died suddenly by carbon monoxide
suicide three months later. He is included
mainly to highlight the occurrence of ac¬
tual suicide among persons who have the
disability often associated with myocardial infarction. The fourth patient, in addition to those covered by Dr. Goldstein, was a re¬ tired employee who died at the plant and is
considered because he died in a situation of
apparent success and elation as will be de¬
scribed more in detail later.
The next-of-kin interviewed regarding these sudden death patients has been the
widow except in four circumstances: once where it was the father, another in which
it was the sibling, and in two circum¬
stances in which it was an extramarital
girlfriend.
Preliminary Findings
Past Illnesses—A history of the pa¬
tient's past health is obtained after
the spouse is asked to give an account of the acute prodromal symptoms and the social circumstances leading up to the patient's death. In all, except three patients, there was evidence that there were some prodromal
symptoms and this may have been
100% if one includes increasing pa¬ tient fatigue, quite evident to the spouse. In nearly all of these sudden death patients, as indicated by Dr. Goldstein, there had been a history of previous myocardial infarction or known cardiovascular disease making

them high-risk patients. We have also been particularly in¬
terested in i eliciting information about the incidence of past peptic ul¬ cer, hiatus hernia, gallbladder dis¬ ease, or evidence of vasodepressor syncope. One of our hypotheses has been that these categories of past ill¬ ness might predict those in the popu¬ lation who are vagal reactors and therefore might be candidates for ar¬ rhythmias and sudden death. These 26 sudden death patients are not a large enough number to make mean¬ ingful comparisons with the group of
patients reaching the hospital alive and surviving 24 hours after in¬ farction. None of the patients with
sudden death, at least according to the private physician or the spouse, had ever had any episodes of what were interpreted by us as vasodepres¬ sor syncope. However, at least a third
of them had had well-documented pep¬
tic ulcer, gallbladder disease, or
hiatus hernia.
We are also gathering from the next-of-kin, as we do with the pa¬ tients who reach the hospital alive, the incidence of vascular disease, par¬ ticularly myocardial infarction, an¬ gina, cerebrovascular ("stroke") epi¬ sodes, and peripheral vascular insuf¬ ficiency in the parents and siblings, regardless of whether the relatives
are still alive or dead and the age at death where this has occurred. This
pertains to one of our hypotheses that there may be an inverse relationship
between the presence of a familial or constitutional factor and the occur¬
rence of prodromal psychological pre¬ cipitating factors. This has been in¬ dicated in certain other diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis.
Psychosocial Data.—The spouses are
asked to give their perceptions of the patient's psychological state on the day of the sudden death and in the 3to 18-month prodromal period. As
mentioned before, it has been of par¬ ticular interest how frequently the
spouse has been afraid that a recur¬
rence of a myocardial infarction or of

a catastrophic illness including death was going to occur and the inability that she has had in getting the pa¬ tient to seek medical help. She usually based this assumption on her aware¬
ness of his tension due to increased
pressure at work, actual longer hours at work," and on family or other so¬ cially precipitated emotional distress for the patient. Even so, approxi¬ mately half of these patients had seen a physician, generally for a scheduled routine check-up or for symptoms of epigastric or chest dis¬ comfort or increase in anginal symp¬ toms, within the preceding ten days.
For all of the patients, the inter¬ view included the family make-up, whether the patient had changed his place of residence recently, whether
the wife is aware of any recent work
change, and in particular, whether there has been any change in the status of the household: parents dy¬ ing, moving into another home, and in particular, family social transitions
which have been a focus of interest to the group at Rochester for some time. This includes the health of the spouse,
whether or not there are offspring,
and whether the children have moved
out of the home recently. In particu¬ lar, among these men who develop myocardial infarction, we have found considerable psychological distress evoked by circumstances in which there were departures or current dis¬ appointing conflicts between the pa¬ tient and a son or daughter, espe¬ cially a son.
Circumstances of departure of a child from the home or disappoint¬ ment of parental expectations appear to be the most commonly reported acute precipitating factor in the pa¬ tients who reached the hospital, as
well as in those with sudden death as
reported by the spouse. It may be that this is a commonplace dilemma and occurrence among 50- to 60-yearold men with their offspring in the
culture of our times. There is some
evidence that this may be a problem peculiar to an industrial plant popu-

lation where there has been for years considerable conflict between em¬
ployee-patients who have worked over the years without going to col¬ lege and other employees who have been to college, where both have the same job classification, for instance as an engineer. It appears to have been particularly important for the one who went to college to have his son emulate him by going to college and for the man who only went to high school or less that his son become one of the college men as he would
like to have been in the cultural hier¬
archy of the plant. The spouse is asked directly
whether there have been any current conflicts between herself and the pa¬
tient. Generally, I think, the spouses have been reasonably open and accu¬
rate in their statements about these
matters, including the adequacy or inadequacy of sexual relationships. Sexual incompatability or impotence has been surprisingly infrequent in these men who are often depressed,
at least as far as the data we have ob¬
tained is concerned, and has not so far been reported as a source of con¬ flict or as the activity occurring at the time of the patient's final acute ill¬
ness with sudden death.
Of particular interest to us has been whether the week or the day of the patient's sudden death has any particular significance as far as the patient or the family is concerned. Was this an anniversary of the death of any parent, of a marriage, of a birth, or any significant event in the life of the patient or the family as a
group such as the age or date of death
of the parents? I described the emo¬ tional significance of such anniver¬ saries, conscious or unconscious, as determinants of distressing affective reaction of patients developing re¬ lapses in leukemias and lymphomas several years ago.'4 Anniversary reac¬
tion as used here is not the same
phenomena described originally by Hilgard pertaining to a parent's re¬ action to a distressing event in his

own life as a child when his child in
turn reaches the same age.15 Such
age-related reactions between parent and child I term "generation reac¬ tions" rather than "anniversary reac¬
tions." These factors have been
stressed particularly by Fischer and Dlinl6,1T in their studies of patients with myocardial infarctions as "emotionally invested deadlines" and have also been noted by Wolf18 in his appreciation of the significance of anniversary reactions. These are the
main areas that we cover in the inter¬ view and there are other details
which I will not go into at the present
time.
Age and Socioeconomic Status.—In
my presentation, I am going to haz¬ ard committing two taboos. One is not to present any tables or figures
and the other is to be somewhat anecdotal about four of the 26 pa¬
tients to whom I am making refer¬ ence in this presentation. But I have to give some figures. The mean age of the 25 patients dying suddenly, most likely from myocardial infarction or arrhythmia, or both, (I am not count¬ ing the man who committed suicide)
was 55.6 years with a median of 56.5
years. Mean age of the patients who reported into the medical facilities on
work with suspect or actual myocar¬
dial infarction was also 55.7 and a me¬
dian of 57 years. Those who reported off work, to their own physician or directly to a hospital, were somewhat
younger: mean age, 52 years, with a
median of 54 years, and they had worked at the plant a somewhat shorter period of time. Combined on-
work and off-work age groups showed a mean age of 54 years, so there is no
significant difference in age of the sudden death patients compared to
the total group of suspect or actual
myocardial infarcts. There is also no
difference in socioeconomic status be¬
tween the sudden death patients and those who reached the hospital alive,
at least within this industrial popu¬
lation which is probably not repre¬ sentative, being of somewhat higher

socioeconomic rank as compared to the total population of Rochester. During the period of the occurrence of the 22 sudden deaths, out of a total of 200 suspect or actual infarctions, there were also six suicides, all among
men, with a mean age of 46 years
(median, 50.5 years). So the deaths by suicide occurred in men nearly a dec¬
ade younger than the members of the
population dying suddenly or those hospitalized with myocardial in¬
farctions.
Representative Patient Summaries.— Psychological factors seemed to play a precipitating factor in the time of development of the event in four categories of sudden death circum¬ stances. It should be pointed out that among 40% to 50% of these patients
no evidence was obtained that acute
psychological factors were of signifi¬ cance in the time of the patient's death, although such factors may have been a factor in the patient's tardiness in getting to medical help. From the data available, via the sources available, at least 80% of these 26 patients had symptoms which could be construed as depres¬ sion. They were and had been "run¬ ning sad."
One 55-year-old man had worked for many years at the plant and had always been quite disorganized and irresponsible in reference to his fam¬ ily as well as his work. Over the course of the summer months, he be¬ gan putting everything in order both
at home and at work. At least in retro¬
spect, his wife felt he knew some¬
thing was going to happen to him and he wanted to have things in order, in¬ cluding insurance policies, his ac¬ counts at home, and his correspond¬ ence at work. According to his wife, he had been depressed due to conflicts with his son because the 18-year-old boy had been in court for stealing and had had to serve out his time in jail
on weekends for several months. In
addition, there was a severe dis¬ appointment for both the patient and
his wife who had saved for this oldest

son to go to college. However, the son had actually had to repeat two years in grammar school, again failed, and was having to repeat another year of high school. On the day after the son was again caught stealing and held for petit larceny, the patient had a massive myocardial infarction at work and died in spite of attempts at resuscitation at the plant.
Representative of the circumstance of a number of patients was the de¬ parture of the last or only child in the family for college or marriage, in re¬ sponse to which the patient had been depressed. However, according to his wife, he had not been able to express these feelings and compensated by overextending himself by working harder at home or at the plant or shoveling snow vigorously and devel¬ oped a sudden cardiovascular collapse.
A unique tale is that of a 50-yearold man who for a year had multiple abscesses of his right breast, not the left, which had required incision and drainage over a period of some eight months, keeping him off from work an appreciable amount of time. He fi¬ nally agreed to go to the hospital and had a mastectomy in August. He had no previous history of cardiovascular disease, but the evening after his sur¬
gery and recovery from anesthesia he
developed a myocardial infarction. Following this he did quite well in re¬ covering from his infarction in the hospital and at home. According to his wife, however, he was increas¬ ingly depressed and particularly up¬
set that he was not able to be active
and return to work. In late October, he had become "not angry," she said, but just "feeling he couldn't do any¬ thing about it" when a group of local youngsters blew up a fire cracker damaging their mailbox on the night of Halloween. Three days later his wife persuaded him to take their first
stroll in his convalescence into the
garden of their home hoping to cheer him up a little. They walked into the back garden and noted for the first time that an arborway, which he had

built early that summer and of which he was very proud, had been sprayed with tar paint. The patient appar¬ ently just looked at this while his wife expressed her anger. At this, the pa¬
tient said he did not feel well and
wanted to return to the house. He got
20 yards, as far as the kitchen side door, and collapsed. As he did so she asked him whether he was having any pain to which he replied, "No." He
died within five minutes. The wife added the fact that she was so re¬
lieved that they had not gone further out into the back yard where they had
a new trailer which had also been tar
spray-painted as a Halloween prank. It happened on this occasion, since
it was unusual for a man to have a
mastectomy, that I asked whether having a mastectomy was of any par¬
ticular significance to this man. To this his wife replied, "It's strange you should ask that question." She then
gave an account that her sister had died two years before on Nov 12 with a carcinoma of the breast after a
mastectomy. This man's death ac¬ tually occurred on Nov 6. His wife then indicated that on Nov 3, one year before, the patient's sister, who
had had a carcinoma of the breast and
a mastectomy, had died. Also on Nov 12, one year ago, his older and favor¬
ite brother had dropped dead of a myocardial infarction.
An additional example is a retired 66-year-old employee who is not in the employee total group, but who is
included because of the circumstances
of his death and because he happened to be in the company plant at the
time of his sudden death. This oc¬
curred when he was playing in a bil¬
liard tournament in the retirees rec¬
reation facility in which he had be¬
come very much involved as one of
the compensations for his retirement the year before. In the particular league match in which he was play¬ ing, he was up against a partner with whom he was especially competitive. This patient also had been depressed since his wife had recently come home

from the hospital having suffered a myocardial infarction and his only child, a 40-year-old daughter, Had been sick and was in the hospital for evaluation of multiple congenital, in¬ cluding cardiac, anomalies. The
course of this match which went
evenly back and forth came down to
the last two balls on the table. The
patient's opponent had an easy shot and the patient said to him "Well, I guess that's it." Whereupon the oppo¬
nent took his shot and missed. This
left the patient an equally easy shot
which he made. He stood up, mani¬
festing his relief and pleasure, and then collapsed on the billiard table
and could not be resuscitated. To the
knowledge of friends who had been with him for the previous two hours, he had been having no symptoms and had been playing well and accurately
without discomfort.
Comments
From this preliminary report, our
data suggest that in at least 50% of the patients with sudden death, psy¬
chological and social factors are asso¬
ciated with the time of sudden death.
It is likely that the frequency of this association might be higher if more specific subjective information were available from the deceased, which is of course impossible. The psychologi¬ cal setting is multifactorial, usually a setting in which the patient has been depressed and expressed this accord¬ ing to another person's observation and a sudden reaction precipitating arousal, such as increased work, anx¬ iety, or anger occurs.
It appears to me that there is some
wisdom in the lore which Engel has
read into the reports in the news¬ papers.8 The data suggest that a com¬
bination of depressive and arousal af¬ fects may together be conducive in engendering sudden death. Perhaps
these combinations of affect states
and their physiologic concomitants produce a disharmonious variety of reactions implemented by autonomic
and hormonal reactions and central

nervous system-mediated behavior. Most attractive is the hypothesis that sudden death occurs in a basically de¬ pressed man with high physio¬ logical coronary disease risk who for some reason experiences high arousal. On return to his baseline ongoing de¬ pressive state after arousal, there may be a decrement in pulse rate and blood pressure in relationship to which there may develop arrhythmia or infarction, or both. The report by Hinkle of relative bradycardia and disordered conduction as predictors of sudden death in his population would support this conjecture.18
I see no reason to assume from the data we have so far on this group of
26 sudden deaths plus superficially
screened data we have on an addi¬
tional 20 patients that any type of telephone heart attack service or mo¬
bile coronary care ambulance would have made any difference. It has been
my interpretation that the patients I have seen, both those reaching the hospital as well as the sudden death patients, would have been reluctant
to turn to someone for assistance
even when appreciating the likelihood that they are having a heart attack of significance. They repress this per¬ ception and rationalize its signifi¬
cance rather than face the prospect of
the helplessness of being sick. This I expressed at the first Prehospital Conference in 1969, in contrast to Hackett's assumption of the patient's use of denial to defend against the anxiety of the threat of death.20 It has
seemed to me, as I stated at the 1969
Prehospital Conference, that some type of buddy system should be worked out for the high-risk patient. The buddy would most logically be his spouse, a sibling, a friend at home, or a fellow worker. Both patient and buddy should be instructed by the physician with a definite, nonalarming statement that the patient is liable to have a subsequent myocar¬ dial infarction and that the patient
should turn to the person who has
been designated as his buddy. They

should both be told what to do if the
physician is not immediately avail¬ able, such as to go to the nearest hos¬ pital emergency room or call the local ambulance. This proposal is related to the fact that I think the main prob¬ lem in the long delay period of pa¬ tients with myocardial infarction has little to do with anxiety about a heart attack per se or anxiety about dying, so-called denial. The patient is more
concerned with a reluctance to admit
being helpless or sick and he can only turn to somebody with whom he has previously lived or worked and feels it is permissible to be helpless. Even so, I doubt that this type of preparation would have made an appreciable dif¬
ference in more than six of these 26
patients with acute sudden death. It is also likely that the most re¬
liable opportunity for gathering data on the relevance of psychosocial circumstances surrounding sudden death in patients will accrue from a study of patients who do die suddenly but do not actually die, that is to say patients who have potentially lethal arrhythmias and are resuscitated. From such patients one can get prodromal data, including patients' actual behavior, thoughts, and affects prior to the event requiring resuscita¬ tion. This approach may present a problem because a few of these pa¬
tients are amnesic for the immediate
prodromal period, but this is not so in most cases. Robert Klein, MD, Dr. Moss, and I are currently getting such information from these patients as they become available in the emer¬ gency department and on the coro¬
nary care units. Most focus of studies
on such patients has instead been on the psychological effects of arrest and
resuscitation. In this connection it is germane to
mention one patient of Dr. Moss's in which the circumstances precipi¬ tating a ventricular tachycardia were certainly closely associated with psy¬ chologically distressful occurrences of considerable idiosyncratic emotional significance to this man. He was in-

terviewed by me since he worked at
the company and was admitted as a
patient of Dr. Moss with a recent ob¬ vious myocardial infarction. He re¬ quested Dr. Moss as his physician since he had taken such thoughtful and effective care of the patient's
wife four years before when she was
terminally ill with a cardiomyopathy
associated with disseminated carci¬
noma of the breast. The patient who had no previous significant cardio¬
vascular illness had not seen Dr.
Moss, nor had he been in Strong Me¬ morial Hospital since the death of his
wife.
While being cared for acutely in the emergency department and with¬
out discomfort with his infarction, he was approached about being a re¬
search patient on the Inhospital Myo¬
cardial Infarction Research Unit
(MIRU) study, the investigative pur¬ pose of which was explained to him. He agreed since he felt his role as re¬ search subject might be beneficial to
someone else. He was therefore asked

to sign the customary consent form. As he was about to sign, it occurred to him that he might be too weak and not attentive enough in his state of illness to sign his name correctly. This immediately reminded him of the evening four years before when his dying wife had to sign a legal document the night before she died
and bemoaned the fact that she was
not sure she had the strength or was enough in her right mind to sign her name properly. The patient did sign his name appropriately but was aware of acute grief feelings touched off by this association of his own situ¬
ation and that of his wife. He was then taken to the third floor of the
hospital, the floor he recalled where his wife had been, and he was pre¬ pared for the usual MIRU investi¬ gative procedures. Still thinking of his wife, he was aware of increased anxiety about what procedures he was going to have to undergo even though he had complete confidence in
Dr. Moss and the MIRU staff. Before

any manipulative procedure such as venipunctures or catheterizations were initiated, he developed acute ventricular tachycardia and severe hypotension requiring resuscitation.
This recurred three times in the next
15 minutes until the patient was stabilized with lidocaine hydrochlo¬ ride therapy.
This is an instance of an acute ar¬
rhythmia which could likely have her¬ alded sudden death and was perhaps precipitated by the patient's idio¬ syncratic circumstances in association
with his wife's death which engen¬
dered, quite privately, feelings of in¬ tense grief as well as anxiety. Such
types of data were available because the patient himself could be inter¬
viewed after the event.
This investigation was supported in part by
Public Health Service program grant MH 11668 and contract PH 43-68-1331 from the National Heart and Lung Institutes.
Eastman Kodak Company participated in this study. Eastman Kodak Company visiting nurses gathered data and obtained information. Carol D. Daley assisted with technical data analysis.
