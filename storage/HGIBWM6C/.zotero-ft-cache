Abstract 
 
OBJECTIVE: The effects of topiramate (TPM) on components of energy balance were tested in male and female rats that were (i) left intact, (ii) castrated or (iii) castrated with replacement therapies consisting of testosterone administration in orchidectomized (OCX) rats and of estradiol or progesterone treatments in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. 
 
METHODS: TPM was mixed into the diet and administered at a dose of 60 mg per kg of body weight. Male and female rats were treated for 28 and 35 days, respectively. At the end of the treatment period, variables of energy balance and determinants of lipid and glucose metabolism were assessed. 
 
RESULTS: TPM reduced energy and fat gains in both male and female rats either in the absence or in the presence of hormone replacement therapies. In male rats, it also decreased food intake, protein gain and energetic efficiency. In female animals, TPM reduced energetic efficiency while it stimulated lipoprotein lipase activity in brown adipose tissue. TPM also reduced plasma glucose and plasma leptin levels in female rats as well as plasma insulin and liver triglycerides in male animals. As expected, castration and sex hormones also strongly influenced energy balance. In male rats, OCX led to a decrease in energy and protein gains that was blocked by treatment with testosterone. In female rats, OVX caused increases in energy, fat and protein gains that were prevented by treatment with estradiol. 
 
CONCLUSION: In female rats, the effects of TPM on fat and energy gains were clearly not influenced by the sex hormone status of the rats. In male animals, there was also no interaction of TPM and the status of sex hormones on energy balance, suggesting that OCX and testosterone minimally interfere with the action of TPM on energy balance. The effects of TPM on energy balance were accounted for by a decrease in energetic efficiency, resulting from an effect exerted by the drug on both energy intake and thermogenesis. The present results also suggest that TPM can enhance insulin sensitivity.
