The rate of progression and risk factors for progression are not clearly defined.\nMethods\n\nThe Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (CARAF) enrolled patients from 6 Canadian cities at the time of their first electrocardiographic diagnosis of AF. Comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic data were collected and patients were followed annually, carefully documenting clinical outcomes, recurrence of paroxysmal AF, and progression to CAF. Baseline clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic variables were evaluated by univariate Cox proportionate hazards analysis. A stepwise approach was used to model the association between echocardiographic and clinical variables with progression to CAF.\nResults\n\nA total of 757 patients with a baseline diagnosis of paroxysmal AF were evaluated. Median follow-up was 8.0 years (range 2 days to 11.1 years). The probability of progression to CAF by 1 year was 8.6% and thereafter there was a slow but steady progression to 24.7% by 5 years. By 5 years, the probability of documented recurrence of any AF (chronic or paroxysmal) was 63.2%. Increasing age, significant aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, and diagnosis of cardiomyopathy were independently associated with progression to CAF. A more rapid heart rate during AF was associated with decreased risk of progression.\nConclusions\n\nAfter the initial diagnosis of paroxysmal AF, there is a slow but steady progression to CAF. Baseline echocardiographic variables, age, cardiomyopathy, and heart rate were independently associated with progression to CAF.\n\n    Previous article in issue\n    Next article in issue \n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, the prevalence of which increases with age, being relatively uncommon under the age of 50 but occurring in 2% to 4% of the population after the age of 65, 1. , 2. , 3. , 4. with doubling of the risk of AF with each advancing decade of life 5 Once considered a benign condition, AF is now recognized to be associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality, particularly from embolism and stroke. 6. , 7. , 8. , 9. , 10. Furthermore, AF can significantly impair quality of life due to symptoms of palpitations and decreased cardiac output. 11. , 12.\n\nPatients with AF are heterogeneous. 1. , 13. , 14. Atrial fibrillation may be associated with significant underlying heart disease, such as heart failure, valvular disease, and hypertension, but may also occur in the absence of any demonstrable disease. Furthermore, AF may range from infrequent paroxysmal recurrences to CAF.\n\nPrevious studies have evaluated different groups of patients with AF, and conclusions regarding the clinical profiles and long-term outcomes are clouded because of the heterogeneity of the patient population studied. 1. , 2. , 13. , 14. , 15. , 16. These studies enrolled patients at different times in their disease course and did not provide detailed baseline data from which to assess risk factors for progression to chronic (permanent) AF and recurrence of paroxysmal AF.\n\nThe Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (CARAF) commenced enrollment in 1990 of patients at their first electrocardiographically diagnosed episode of AF. Detailed data were collected at the time of enrollment and during regular follow-up. Thus, CARAF provides a unique opportunity to follow a large cohort of patients at the time of their entry into the medical care system for AF and provides the opportunity to assess the long-term outcome in a nondirected follow-up design.\nMethods\nCanadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation population\n\nThe CARAF enrolled 1097 patients between 1990 and 1996 at 7 centers in 6 cities across Canada. 17 Patients were enrolled at the time of their initial electrocardiographically confirmed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Patients were enrolled from offices of family physicians and specialists, emergency rooms, and during hospitalization for other diagnoses. Screening took place in the hospitals of the investigators in a continuous fashion by evaluating emergency room logs and screening inpatient electrocardiograms. Outpatient referrals were received from physicians' offices that had been notified of the nature of the study and attempted to refer all patients who were considered to have a new diagnosis of AF.\nStudy population\n\nAll patients were presumed to have paroxysmal AF at the time of diagnosis. To reduce the chances of misclassification, those patients who were observed to be in AF up to the 3-month visit without documentation of return to sinus rhythm were considered to be in CAF and were excluded (142 subjects). Those who developed AF during hospitalization for heart surgery were excluded (198 subjects), leaving a cohort of 757 subjects.\nData collection\n\nAt the time of enrolment, within 3 months of the index episode of AF, trained study nurses performed a comprehensive baseline evaluation at the study centers. All data forms were sent to the Vancouver coordinating center for data entry and data verification. Baseline data included a comprehensive history, including a past medical history of cardiovascular, central nervous system, and endocrine disorders as well as a history of precipitating events. Baseline laboratory data included an electrocardiogram during AF as well as during sinus rhythm, if sinus rhythm was restored. Chemical laboratory evaluation included T4 and/or TSH measurements. Echocardiograms were done on all patients, with specific attention to cavity dimension, ventricular function, myocardial thickness, and valvular disease. All medications were carefully documented and any interventions at the time of presentation were recorded.\n\nPatients' care was not directed by the study cardiologist but by their own physicians. No restrictions to therapy or protocols for treatment were imposed. A telephone interview was conducted at 3 months. Follow-up visits were performed by the research nurse at 1 year and then yearly. At each visit, a comprehensive follow-up form was completed, carefully chronicling major clinical events, interventions, and changes in medications. Electrocardiograms were obtained within a month of each annual visit and read by the study investigator. Echocardiograms were repeated at 2, 4, 7, and 10 years. If episodes of AF were reported, source documents were obtained, when possible, from physicians' offices or hospital medical records. Serious events (myocardial infarction, stroke, death) were adjudicated by 2 CARAF investigators.\nDefinitions\n\nRecurrent paroxysmal AF was defined as an episode of AF by history or electrocardiographic (ECG) documentation with subsequent demonstration of reversion to sinus rhythm. Chronic AF was defined as the ECG documentation of AF on 2 consecutive electrocardiograms separated by a minimum of 1 week. For the purposes of the analysis, we classified patients as CAF patients at visit t if they were determined to be in CAF at visit t and were classified as having ongoing CAF for the next annual visit with no documentation of sinus rhythm in the interim. If death or withdrawal occurred after the patient was classified as chronic, but before the next annual visit, the patient was considered chronic for purposes of the analysis. Where CAF was reported without a date of onset, we assumed the progression occurred at the midpoint of the 2 visits. Therefore, patients with CAF in our cohort correspond to those referred to as permanent AF by the more recent definition. 18\nAnalyses\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, the time of the first ECG recording of AF was considered as the beginning of the follow-up period. All patients had completed 6 years of follow-up, which, according to the definition of CAF above, permitted complete analysis of the status of patients at 5 years. To evaluate factors associated with progression from initial diagnosis of paroxysmal AF to CAF, clinical parameters (including cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, endocrine, smoking and alcohol history; TSH, T4; blood pressure, heart rate) and echocardiographic parameters (atrial and ventricular dimensions, wall thickness, valve status) collected at baseline were examined. Categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 test and continuous variables were compared using the Student t test. All significance tests were 2-sided and P < .05 was chosen as the cut-off for statistical significance.\n\nCox proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate potential factors associated with progression to CAF. Based on a review of the literature and clinical experience, a subset of variables was chosen for univariate analysis. Variables selected for inclusion in the multivariate model either met statistical significance ( P < .25) in the univariate analysis or were deemed to be clinically important. Clinically important variables (sex, hypertension, congestive heart failure [CHF], left ventricular hypertrophy by echo, β-blocker, or antiarrhythmic use at baseline) were included in the model regardless of statistical significance and then forward and backward stepwise methods were used to develop the multivariate model.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\n\nOf the 757 patients in the cohort, 290 were female (38.3%). The age ranged from 14 to 91 years at the time of enrollment, with a median age of 64 years (first quartile = 53; third quartile = 71; mean = 61.2 + 14.2 years). Mean blood pressures were systolic 133.7 + 24.9 mm Hg and diastolic 81.6 + 15.8 mm Hg. The mean heart rate, during the initial presentation with AF, was 124.4 + 34.0 beats/min. β-Blockers were used by 12.3% of patients, whereas 41.0% patients were on antiarrhythmic medication after diagnosis of AF. Symptoms (including palpitations, breathlessness, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, or fatigue) were reported at the time of presentation in AF in 86.0% of patients, whereas the remaining 14.0% had no symptoms and were identified on the basis of ECG findings alone. Only 14.1% of the patients were current smokers at baseline and 42.0% had never smoked. Alcohol consumption was documented with 14.7% consuming more than 7 units/week, 40.6% consuming 1 to 7 units/week, and 44.7% none. The baseline medical history of this study cohort is summarized in Table I .\n\nTable I .

Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 14.4%, and 26.2% had left ventricular systolic dysfunction: 11.8% dyskinetic, 4.1% hyperkinetic, and 84.1% hypokinetic. Mitral valve disease was present in 52.8% of subjects with mitral regurgitation as the most common presentation (86.2%). Moderate or severe regurgitation was considered to be significant and was present in 21.7% of those with mitral regurgitation. Mitral stenosis was uncommon, seen in only 10 patients. Aortic valve disease was identified in 36.6% of subjects with aortic insufficiency comprising 49.5% (only 7.4% of this group were moderate or severe) and aortic stenosis comprising 10.0%. Only 10 patients had moderate or severe aortic stenosis, representing 1.4% of the total cohort. Thickening of the aortic leaflets was identified in the remaining patients with aortic valve disease. Only moderate to severe valve disease was considered in the following analyses.\n\nTable II reports continuous variables obtained from the baseline echocardiograms. Baseline echocardiographic characteristics were compared for patients who progressed to CAF (n = 169) and those who did not (n = 588). Not all echocardiographic measurements were available in all subjects. Left atrial dimension (LAD), left ventricular systolic dimension, and septal and posterior wall thickness were all significantly greater in the group that progressed to CAF. Fractional shortening was less in the group that progressed.\n\nTable II .

Mitral valve disease was present in 69.1% of those who progressed to CAF and in 48.0% of those who did not ( P < .0001). Significant mitral regurgitation was more frequently seen in those who progressed (18.5%) vs those who did not (7.3%; P < .0001). All aortic valve disease was more prevalent in those who progressed (50.0% vs 32.6%, P < .0001). Although the incidence of significant aortic stenosis was low, there was a higher frequency in those who progressed (3.6% vs 0.7%, P = .012). There were no significant differences in the frequency of mitral stenosis or aortic regurgitation, although the incidence of mitral stenosis and significant aortic regurgitation were low.\nProgression of AF\n\nThe median follow-up was 8.0 years, ranging from 2 days to 11.1 years. At 5 years, 169 patients had progressed to CAF. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probability of progression to CAF by 1 year was 8.6% and thereafter there was a slow but steady progression such that by 5 years the probability of progression increased to 24.7% ( Figure 1 ). Of the 169 subjects who progressed to CAF, 36.7% had at least one episode of documented paroxysmal AF before progressing to CAF. As illustrated, the incidence of documented recurrence (paroxysmal or chronic) was 63.2% by 5 years. Only 15.5% of the patients were free of symptoms compatible with AF or documented AF throughout the 5 years of follow-up; the remainder reported symptoms consistent with AF that were undocumented by electrocardiogram.

Proportions of documented and undocumented paroxysmal AF: by visit.\nFactors associated with progression to CAF\n\nTo examine the factors associated with progression to CAF, we univariately examined potential covariates in a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age and sex. The results are summarized in Table III . A total of 9 factors were associated with progression to CAF, 8 of them increasing the likelihood of progression and 1 reducing the likelihood of progression (increased heart rate during AF negatively associated with progression). Left atrial dimension was an important factor associated with progression to CAF both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable with 3 levels (% of total cohort in each group shown in parenthesis): <40 mm (48.6%), 40 to 45 mm (29.5%), and >45 mm (15.9%). These cutpoints were chosen to reflect clinical impressions of normal, mildly enlarged, and significantly enlarged, respectively. In 6.1% of the cohort, technical difficulty prevented accurate assessment of LAD.\n\nTable III .

We tested the proportional hazards assumption, which was not violated ( P = .54). In the multivariate model, 6 of 9 factors suggested to be significant in the univariate model remained significant ( Table IV ). As in the univariate model, age, diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, significant aortic stenosis, significant mitral regurgitation, and left atrial enlargement were associated with increased risk of progression to CAF. Risk of progression increased by 40% for every 10-year increase in age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; CI 1.21-1.63). History of cardiomyopathy had a HR of 2.41 (CI 1.02-5.70). Moderate to severe aortic stenosis (HR, 3.0; CI 1.29-7.19) and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (HR, 1.69; CI 1.10-2.57) were also associated with an increased risk of progression. Even mild enlargement of the left atrium, at sizes often considered at the upper range of normal, increases the risk of progression to CAF. The left atria of intermediate dimension (40-45 mm) showed a risk of progression only slightly less than that in the left atria of the greater dimensions ( Figure 3 ).\n\nTable IV .

Cumulative incidence of chronic AF: by LAD.\n\nA more rapid heart rate during AF at baseline was associated with a lower risk of developing CAF. Each 5 beat/min increase in heart rate during AF was associated with a 6% decreased risk of progression (HR, 0.94; CI 0.91-0.96).\nDiscussion\n\nThe CARAF provides a unique opportunity to follow the undirected observational follow-up of patients presenting with paroxysmal AF. It is unique because it enrolls patients at the time they engage the health care system with AF and is the first large study to evaluate the progression to CAF in this population. Because CARAF physician investigators did not direct the care of enrolled patients, CARAF also provides an opportunity to monitor patterns of practice. Other studies have evaluated the epidemiology of AF in population studies. The Framingham Heart Study 1. , 5. and the Cardiovascular Health Study 19 have both provided illuminating data on the prevalence of AF in a population as well as the incidence of paroxysmal AF. They have evaluated risk factors for the development of AF, and the Framingham Heart Study has evaluated the echocardiographic predictors of development of AF. 20. , 21. The CARAF is complementary and provides important information from a larger cohort of patients with incident AF and comprehensive follow-up.\n\nThe CARAF has demonstrated that progression to CAF is most rapid in the first year after initial diagnosis (8.6%) and then rises more slowly to 24.7% by 5 years. At each visit, a high percentage of patients reported symptoms consistent with recurrent paroxysmal AF, although fewer had these episodes documented by electrocardiogram. The frequency of symptoms consistent with AF may, indeed, overestimate the recurrence rate. Bhandari et al found that 70% of transtelephonic transmissions during symptoms compatible with AF showed AF whereas the remainder showed no arrhythmia or another rhythm disturbance. 22 On the other hand, many episodes of AF may be asymptomatic, leading to an underestimation of recurrence. In a follow-up of patients with AF using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, Page et al estimated that asymptomatic episodes of AF occurred 12 times more frequently than symptomatic events. 23 Only 15.5% of our cohort remained free of recurrence, either documented or by a history of suggestive symptoms without documentation.\n\nThe factors associated with progression to CAF are of interest to the practicing physician. Enlargement of the left atrium has previously been shown to be a risk factor for the development of AF. The Framingham Heart Study demonstrated a 42% increased risk for development of AF with every 5-mm increment in left atrial size. The CARAF demonstrates an increased risk of progressing to CAF with LADs in the upper range of normal or minimally enlarged (40-45 mm) and that this risk increases further with larger diameters. Whether left atrial size is a marker for scar formation and thus an increased propensity for AF or whether the left atrium may become enlarged due to more significant episodes of AF is unclear. Increasing age, understandably, predicts a greater risk of progression to CAF. This would support previous data from epidemiological studies that have demonstrated an increased incidence of development of AF with advancing age. Both mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis of moderate to severe degree were associated with an increased probability of progression. Both valvular lesions would be expected to increase left atrial pressure and stretch and would increase the propensity for AF. A diagnosis of cardiomyopathy may reflect a variety of etiologies, including hypertension, which is not independently associated with a higher probability of progression. Cardiomyopathies will result in increased left atrial pressure and wall stress. A surprising feature was the lower probability of progression in those with more rapid ventricular heart rates during AF. The reason for this association is uncertain but this patient group may have better atrioventricular conduction, which, in turn, may reflect better intracardiac conduction, including conduction through the atrium.\nLimitations\n\nThe CARAF cohort is not population based, and, as such, generalizability of our findings may be limited. Nonetheless, the patients enrolled were screened in a consistent manner from their various sources of referral and, thus, may reasonably represent a population of patients presenting for the first time with AF. The CARAF was designed in the late 1980s when paroxysmal and chronic were the terms used to describe AF. The newer designations of permanent, persistent, and paroxysmal AF allow a clearer differentiation of patients. Using the CARAF definitions, nondifferential misclassification of persistent and permanent is thus possible. To adjust for this, we required 2 consecutive annual visits with ECG evidence of “chronic” AF before the patient was designated as “chronic” for this analysis, making it likely that most patients with CAF would fit the newer definition of permanent AF. 17\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the CARAF Coordinators—Cheryl McIlroy, RN, Diane Skippen, Vancouver; Debbie Ritchie, RN, Calgary; Bonnie Spindler, RN, London; Loree Morrison, RN, Hamilton; Marilynn Luce, RN, Ottawa; and Danielle Beaudoin, RN, Montreal—for their dedication to this study.
