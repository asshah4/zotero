Abstract 
Recognizing oneself as the owner of a body and the agent of actions requires specific mechanisms which have been elucidated only recently. One of these mechanisms is the monitoring of signals arising from bodily movements, i.e. the central signals which contribute to the generation of the movements and the sensory signals which arise from their execution. The congruence between these two sets of signals is a strong index for determining the experiences of ownership and agency, which are the main constituents of the experience of being an independent self. This mechanism, however, does not account from the frequent cases where an intention is generated but the corresponding action is not executed. In this paper, it is postulated that such covert actions are internally simulated by activating specific cortical networks or representations of the intended actions. This process of action simulation is also extended to the observation and the recognition of actions performed or intended by other agents. The problem of disentangling representations that pertain to self-intended actions from those that pertain to actions executed or intended by others, is a critical one for attributing actions to their respective agents. Failure to recognize one’s own actions and misattribution of actions may result from pathological conditions which alter the readability of these representations.

Abstract 
Self–other discrimination was investigated with point-light displays in which actions were presented with or without additional auditory information. Participants first executed different actions (dancing, walking and clapping) in time with music. In two subsequent experiments, they watched point-light displays of their own or another participant’s recorded actions, and were asked to identify the agent (self vs. other). Manipulations were applied to the visual information (actions differing in complexity, and degradation from 15 to 2 point-lights within the same clapping action) and to the auditory information (self-generated vs. externally-generated vs. none). Results indicate that self-recognition was better than chance in all conditions and was highest when observing relatively unconstrained patterns of movement. Auditory information did not increase accuracy even with the most ambiguous visual displays, suggesting that judgments of agent identity depend much more on motor cues than on auditory (action-generated) or audiovisual (synchronization) information.

Abstract 
Embodied cognition (EC) underlines that cognition is constrained by the kind of body we possess, and stresses the importance of action for cognition. In this perspective the body is always considered as an acting body. Here, we review EC literature discussing studies that show that body parts are not considered independent of their involvement in action. We propose to extend EC perspective through studying the body independently from its direct involvement in goal-directed action. Through this we aim to avoid the risk of limiting the notion of “sense of the body” to the restricted boundaries of the flesh of brain–body system. In our extended perspective language is considered as a form of action too. We propose that: (a) internal language (i.e. social language used as an internal medium for thought and planning) can contribute to form a unitary sense of our body, and (b) language can help to reshape the way we implicitly perceive our own body. Namely, it can modify our sense of body by extending its boundaries beyond the boundaries of the anatomical body. We argue for an integrated notion of bodily self-suggesting that the internal sense and the boundaries of the human body coincide with the extensions that linguistic tools allow. In sum, the basic idea we hold is that human body is a social entity.

Abstract 
We investigated the specific contribution of efferent information in a self-recognition task. Subjects experienced a passive extension of the right index finger, either as an effect of moving their left hand via a lever (‘self-generated action’), or imposed externally by the experimenter (‘externally-generated action’). The visual feedback was manipulated so that subjects saw either their own right hand (‘view own hand’ condition) or someone else's right hand (‘view other's hand condition) during the passive extension of the index finger. Both hands were covered with identical gloves, so that discrimination on the basis of morphological differences was not possible. Participants judged whether the right hand they saw was theirs or not. Self-recognition was significantly more accurate when subjects were themselves the authors of the action, even though visual and proprioceptive information always specified the same posture, and despite the fact that subjects judged the effect and not the action per se. When the passive displacement of the participants right index finger was externally generated, and only afferent information was available, self-recognition performance dropped to near-chance levels. Differences in performance across conditions reflect the distinctive contribution of efferent information to self-recognition, and argue against a dominant role of proprioception in self-recognition.

The team-mate identification (TM-ID) test: Effect of participant and situation familiarity on response accuracy and latency 
International Journal of Sports Science and Coaching , Volume 5, Issue 2, 1 June 2010, Pages 281-290 
 
Abstract 
In field and pool sports, players' running or swimming motor patterns appear to characterise them, and these 'gait signatures' may aid in identifying players as team-mates. If this identification process was sufficiently brief to be relevant in ball sports, training to improve familiarity with team-mates' movement patterns may improve team performance. We examined time for Team-Mate Identification (TM-ID) decisions under different circumstances. 6 water-polo players (team-mate participants) and 6 club swimmers (unknown distractors) were filmed sprint swimming past two video cameras, one above and one below the water surface. The resulting footage was edited into two randomised series of video-clips. The water-polo players then viewed the clips and determined whether each observed swimmer was a team-mate or not, in the fastest possible time. Participants were faster with an overwater than an underwater view, significantly better than chance at identifying their team-mates, and did so in a mean time of 381 ms, which is within the normal window of time where expert sports people might be required to make time-stressed decisions.

Keeping in touch with one's self: Multisensory mechanisms of self-consciousness 
PLoS ONE , Volume 4, Issue 8, 5 August 2009 
 
Abstract 
Background: The spatial unity between self and body can be disrupted by employing conflicting visual-somatosensory bodily input, thereby bringing neurological observations on bodily self-consciousness under scientific scrutiny. Here we designed a novel paradigm linking the study of bodily self-consciousness to the spatial representation of visuo-tactile stimuli by measuring crossmodal congruency effects (CCEs) for the full body. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured full body CCEs by attaching four vibrator-light pairs to the trunks (backs) of subjects who viewed their bodies from behind via a camera and a head mounted display (HMD). Subjects made speeded elevation (up/down) judgments of the tactile stimuli while ignoring light stimuli. To modulate self-identification for the seen body subjects were stroked on their backs with a stick and the felt stroking was either synchronous or asynchronous with the stroking that could be seen via the HMD. We found that (1) tactile stimuli were mislocalized towards the seen body (2) CCEs were modulated systematically during visual-somatosensory conflict when subjects viewed their body but not when they viewed a body-sized object, i.e. CCEs were larger during synchronous than during asynchronous stroking of the body and (3) these changes in the mapping of tactile stimuli were induced in the same experimental condition in which predictable changes in bodily self-consciousness occurred. Conclusions/Significance: These data reveal that systematic alterations in the mapping of tactile stimuli occur in a full body illusion and thus establish CCE magnitude as an online performance proxy for subjective changes in global bodily self-consciousness. © 2009 Aspell et al.

Abstract 
 
How do I know it was me who moved? A recent experimental study illustrates the contribution of one's body schema and awareness of one's own actions to self-recognition. The results provide evidence that bodily cues and action cues are important in self-recognition, and they demonstrate that action cues overrule bodily cues. 
Abstract 
 
A recent study by Esther van den Bos and Marc Jeannerod demonstrates that bodily cues and action cues contribute to self-recognition and that the latter overrule the former.

How do we recognize ourselves? The first intuition is that self-recognition has something to do with recognizing our own face and other features that characterize us, as when we look in a mirror. Previous research has shown that our own face is indeed an important cue for self-recognition and that specific neural circuits are dedicated to its processing [ 1 and 2 ]. Mirror self-recognition has been considered a benchmark for self-recognition in general [ 3 ]. However, developmental and comparative studies suggest that this benchmark is not easily met: toddlers do not recognize themselves in the mirror before the age of 15 months [ 4 ] and, apart from humans, this ability has only been observed in great apes [ 5 ]. 
Self-recognition of body and action 
 
There is good reason to believe that mirror self-recognition is only one particular aspect of self-recognition. Observing ourselves in mirrors is not representative of the way in which we normally perceive and recognize our body and our actions. Most of the time, we have only some parts of our body in our field of view; for example, our hands, forearms, belly, legs and feet. Moreover, we also continuously receive tactile and proprioceptive information about our body that is integrated with this visual information. The correlations between these different sources of information lead to the formation, from early childhood, of an inter-modal representation of our body often referred to as ‘body image’ [ 6 ]. It is likely that the body image plays an important role in self-recognition because it provides information about which parts of the visual input might belong to our own body, given a certain tactile and proprioceptive input. 
 
An equally important aspect of self-recognition is related to the fact that some of our body parts frequently move. If we are lucky enough not to suffer from neurological syndromes like the anarchic hand [ 7 ], these movements follow our intentions. In order to assure that they do, we need to compare our intentions with the events that follow them [ 8 and 9 ]. For instance, when intending to move our index finger we would be very surprised to see our thumb move. Thus, anticipation of events accompanying or resulting from intended actions can also contribute to self-recognition because one can attribute the intended events to oneself [ 10 , 11 and 12 ]. 
Alien hands 
 
Until recently, only few empirical studies addressed self-recognition. One reason might be that it is very difficult to think of situations in which healthy adults fail to recognize themselves. However, in a recently published study, Esther van den Bos and Marc Jeannerod [ 13 ] successfully created an experimental setting that allowed them to assess the relative contributions of bodily and action cues to self-recognition. They used a modified version of the alien hand paradigm, originally developed by Elena Daprati and her colleagues [ 14 ] to investigate disorders of self-recognition in schizophrenic patients [ 15 , 16 and 17 ]. 
 
The setting in van den Bos and Jeannerod's experiment was as follows (see Fig. 1 ). The participant and the experimenter sat at opposite sides of a table. Both wore gloves on their right hands to remove cues to identity. Each of them placed his or her right hand on the table so that the hands faced each other. The participant's hand was hidden below a screen mounted on the table and inclined by 45°. A mirror was attached to the back side of the screen so that it reflected both hands. A video camera filmed the mirror image that was displayed on the screen. For the participant, this created the impression of looking directly at the table on which the two hands were placed.

Fig. 1. Experimental set-up in van den Bos and Jeannerod's experiment [ 13 ]. The participant and the experimenter sit opposite each other and place their right hands on a table. The participant's hand is hidden below a screen. A video camera films the image reflected by a mirror attached to the back of the screen, and the image on the screen creates the impression for the participant of looking directly at the table.

Each trial began with the participant's and experimenter's hands held in a fist. While the screen was still switched off a signal indicated to the participant to move either the thumb or the index finger. The screen was then switched on and after another auditory signal the participant and the experimenter simultaneously initiated their movements. In a ‘same-movement’ condition, the experimenter moved the same finger as the participant, whereas in a ‘different-movement’ condition, the experimenter moved another finger (see Fig. 2 a). After 1 second, the screen was switched off again and an arrow appeared pointing to the location on the screen where one of the two hands had been displayed. The participant's task was to judge whether the hand he or she had seen at this location was his or her own.

Fig. 2. Experimental conditions used by van den Bos and Jeannerod. (a) The experimenter simultaneously carried out either the same or a different movement from the participant. For instance, in the same-movement condition (left), both moved their index finger; in the different-movement condition (right) the experimenter moved the thumb when the participant moved the index finger. (b) In addition, the image displayed on the screen was rotated by 0°, 90°, −90°, or 180°. In the 0° degree condition, the orientation of the participants’ hand (P) was congruent with their body orientation. When the image was rotated by 90° or −90°, the orientation of both hands was incongruent. When the image was rotated by 180°, the orientation of the experimenter's hand (E) was congruent with the participant's body orientation.

In addition, the image on the screen was either rotated by 90°, −90°, 180°, or not rotated (see Fig. 2 b). Image rotation was pre-programmed and did not create noticeable temporal delays. With no rotation, the spatial orientation of the participant's own hand was of course congruent with the orientation of her or his body. When the image was rotated by 90° or −90°, the orientation of the participant's as well as the experimenter's hand was incongruent with the participant's body orientation, that is, both hands were seen as ‘alien’. When the image was rotated by 180°, the experimenter's hand orientation was congruent with the participant's body orientation and the participant's hand orientation was congruent with the experimenter's body orientation. In other words, the experimenter's hand was seen as if it belonged to the participant's body and the participant's own hand was seen as if it belonged to the experimenter's body. 
 
Using this set-up, van den Bos and Jeannerod first assessed the effect of action cues on self-recognition by comparing error rates in the different-movement (DM) and the same-movement (SM) conditions (chance level is at 50%). The participants almost always recognized their own hand in the DM condition (1% error rate). However, they had much more difficulty recognizing their own hand when the experimenter carried out the same movement (24% error rate in the SM condition). This result indicates that the participants used action cues because self-recognition became more difficult when fewer action cues were present. 
 
In a next step, van den Bos and Jeannerod assessed the effects of bodily cues on self-recognition by comparing error rates for different rotations. In the DM condition, bodily cues did not affect the error rates. Thus, non-ambiguous action cues completely overruled bodily cues. However, in the SM condition (when action cues were therefore ambiguous) bodily cues affected the error rates. They were lowest (15%) when participants’ hand orientation was congruent with their body orientation (0° rotation), intermediate (24%) when the orientation of both hands was incongruent with body orientation (−90° and 90° rotation), and highest (35%) when the experimenter's hand orientation was congruent with the participants’ body orientation (180° rotation). The result that the error rate in the 180° condition was higher than in all other conditions clearly indicates that the body schema contributes to self-recognition, at least when non-ambiguous action cues are unavailable. 
Future research 
 
One question not fully answered by the experiment is which action cues allowed the participants to distinguish their own actions from those of the experimenter despite their carrying out the same movement. There are several potential differences between the two movements that might have been detected, including spatial deviations [ 18 ], differences in the temporal onset [ 19 ], or other differences in the movement kinematics [ 20 ]. Disentangling the contributions of different action cues to self-recognition would be well worth investgating in future research. 
 
In conclusion, van den Bos and Jeannerod's study provides new evidence that helps to clarify the relative contributions of body schema and awareness of action to self-recognition. The results show that bodily cues are used when action cues are ambiguous. The technique they have developed could also be used to study distortions of self-recognition in different groups of neuropsychological and psychiatric patients. Such studies could help elucidate which specific neural systems underlie self-recognition. 
 
Similar techniques could also be applied to address further aspects of self-recognition in healthy adults. In van den Bos and Jeannerod's study the movement itself was the action goal. In many situations, however, the action goal consists of manipulating objects, either directly or with the help of tools – for example, when hammering a nail. It is to be hoped that future studies will address the question of whether the same or different cues are used for these and other types of actions. Such studies could make an important contribution to the the scientific understanding and demystification of the self.
