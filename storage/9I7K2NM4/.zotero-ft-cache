Abstract 
Gas chromatographic analysis of the secretion of the Nassanoff gland of worker honey bees within 4 min of its collection indicates the presence of both isomers of citral to the combined extentof about 3 pet cent of the amount of geraniol present. Field tests show that citral is the most attractive single compound in the secretion to honey bees. It is more attractive when tested alone (0·39 μg) against a combination of the other known components of the secretion (geraniol, 100 μg, with geranic and nerolic acids, 100 μg). Citral (0·77 μg) + geraniol (0·20 to 0·39 μg) was almost as attractive to bees as the odour of Nassanoff secretion collected from ten foraging bees.

Abstract 
The amount of geraniol obtained by a standard procedure from the Nassanoff gland of the honey bee varied from zero to 1·5 μg per bee, depending on the age of the bees. Newly emerged bees had no geraniol. Guard bees produced ca. 0·3 μg per bee and a marked increase to ca. 1·0 μg per bee occurred when the bees began to forage.

Abstract 
In vitro tests showed that citral and geraniol inhibited the fungus Ascosphaera apis which causes chalkbrood disease in the honeybee, Apis mellifera . The vapors of 5 μl of citral or 10 μl of geraniol per culture dish prevented vegetative growth. Daily applications of 30 μl of citral per dish killed sporulated cultures within 48 hr. However, A. apis spores in dried larval remains (mummies) survived 96-hr exposure to the vapors of 30 μl of citral per dish per day. 
 
Vapors of a geranic and nerolic acid mixture, 2-heptanone, isopentyl acetate, octanoic acid, and citronella and melissa oils were less inhibitory than citral or geraniol. Potassium sorbate, sodium propionate, and tetracycline had no inhibitory effect when placed on the culture medium. Remains of larvae killed by American foulbrood disease caused only a slight reduction in the growth of A. apis .

Abstract 
The mandibular gland secretion of workers of the stingless bee Trigona subterranea is dominated by geranial and neral, the two stereoisomers of citral. This terpene is a powerful attractant for workers of T. subterranea and is the primary trail-following compound utilized by this species. Workers are either repelled or they exhibit attack and alarm behaviour in the presence of very high concentrations of citral. 
 
Citral is also produced by the robbing bee Lestrimelitta limao . Workers of Melipona and Trigona species, which are normally robbed by L. limao , appear to be completely disoriented by high concentrations of citral. The behaviour of species of bees which are not attacked by L. limao is not drastically altered in the presence of this terpene aldehyde. Citral is identified as the probable key factor responsible for the successful robbing activities of L. limao workers. The rôle of exocrine products which are employed as allomones by robbing bees and ants is discussed.

Abstract 
Citral (I) is cyclized by UV irradiation 1 to 2-isopropenyl-5-methylcyclopentane-carboxaldehyde (II), containing the carbon skeleton of the monoterpenes of ants and catmint. 1,6,6-Trimethylbicyclo[2,1,1]hexane-2α-carboxaldehyde (XII, R = H), produced in lesser amount at the same time, was synthesized from camphor. The two photocitrals may, perhaps, come from a common intermediate containing the cyclopentane ring.

Abstract 
 
Citral is identified as a minor component of the Nassanoff pheromone. Although not present initially in the exocrine secretions of the Nassanoff gland, citral is found in secretions kept at room temperature. Citral increases to a maximum of about 8 per cent after 15 to 20 hr at 23°C and then decreases, but it is still present after 30 hr. Citral is attractive to foraging honey bees, as are geraniol and nerolic acid, the major components of the Nassanoff pheromone.
