INTRODUCTION

elective surgery of eight different indices of the extent

of coronary artery disease: the number of diseased
vessels, two indices using the number of proximal ar-
terial segments diseased, two empirically generated indices from the CASS data, and the published indices of Friesinger, Gensini, and the National Heart and
Chest Hospital, London. All had considerable prognostic information. Typically 80% of the prognostic
information in one index was also contained in another. Our analysis shows that good prediction from angiographic data results from a combination of left ven-
tricular function and arteriographic extent of disease. Prognosis may reasonably be obtained from three simple indices: the number of vessels diseased, the number of proximal arterial segments diseased, and a left ven-
tricular wall motion score. These three indices account

Interventions such as bypass surgery and the use of potent drugs emphasize the need for a thorough understanding of the natural history of coronary artery disease. Identification of high risk groups of patients who may benefit from certain treatments depends
upon adequate evaluation of the characteristics that influence survival. Analysis of high quality coronary arteriograms and ventriculograms offers a good assessment of the anatomical consequence of coronary artery disease and left ventricular function. Since the introduction of coronary angiography many different arteriographic indices have been developed to predict survival in subsets of patients (1-5). In addition, it has been earlier shown (6-8) that left ventricular function has an important effect on prognosis even if the patients are grouped into different arteriographic classes.

This study was undertaken to: (a) compare the prog-

CASS carried out under the auspices of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute contains a registry of 24,959 patients enrolled from August 1975 to June 1979. At the 15 cooperative centers, all patients who were studied angiographically for suspected or proven coronary artery disease were enrolled in the registry (subject to their informed con-
sent). Angiographic findings were recorded on standardized forms, and readings were quality controlled. The percentage narrowing of arterial segments was estimated by visual assessment. Vital status is known in 99.8% of the registry patients. A detailed description of CASS has been previously published (9). This study is based on analysis of 8,773 registry patients with at least minimal coronary artery disease who did not have surgery, or who had very late surgery.

of myocardium are more heavily weighted. For example, the left main coronary artery receives the heaviest weight. For each segment the two weights are multiplied. The sum of the products is the modified Gensini score.
6. National Heart and Chest Hospital (NHCH) index. Feuerlicht et al. (5) presented an index from the National Heart and Chest Hospital, London, based on a schematic diagram of the coronary artery tree. The product of the fraction luminal openings of the segments on each path on the coronary tree is calculated. The sum of these products, normalized to lie between 0 and 100, gives the index.
7. Modified NHCH index. This index uses the product of the luminal opening fractions as in the NHCH index. Before summation, each of the products is weighted by a factor that reflects the relative importance for myocardial

For purposes of this study, medically treated patients are defined as those who did not have surgery, or who had very late surgery. The number of days after enrollment within which 95% of the first year bypass surgeries occurred was determined for each clinic. Patients with surgery within this period were excluded from this study. An alternative method was used wherein all 16,286 patients with at least minimal coronary artery disease were used. In this analysis, patients treated surgically were also included, but considered as lost

to follow-up at the time of their bypass surgery.

To estimate the ability of each index to predict survival,
each index was used to categorize patients into risk groups. The risk groups for an index were compared in a life table

The results of the comparison by stepwise Cox analysis are shown in Table IV. Five indices were selected by the stepwise procedure. Each of the five indices gives additional statistically significant predictive information in the presence of the other four. When left ventricular score was included it was selected first by
the stepwise procedure as being most predictive. Ventricular score was followed by the arterial segment score, the NHCH index, the Friesinger index, and the proximal segments score.
The information content of the overall index constructed from the stepwise Cox analysis of all the angiographic indices is compared with several other indices in Table V. The overall index, which was selected as the most predictive linear combination of the single indices, is computed from the left ventricular score, arterial segments score, NHCH index, Friesinger Index, and proximal segments score. The other combination indices were constructed by Cox analyses restricted to subgroups of indices. The left ventricular score alone had 63% of the information joint with the

It is important to note that no consideration was taken of the influence of anthropometric, clinical, or
laboratory variables. Such data were not considered in the development of the predictive angiographic indices. It has recently been shown that in patients with coronary artery disease, subgroups with low, middle, and high risk can be delineated using only clinical variables (14).

suggests that several of the indices measure different characteristics affecting the prognosis. However, the number of indices chosen by the stepwise procedure is large in part because of the statistical power afforded by the large number of patients in CASS.

In summary, analysis of mortality in nonsurgically treated patients in the CASS registry using life table analysis and the stepwise Cox proportional hazards survival model has shown that: (a) Several commonly used indices of the extent of arterial disease have

roughly the same amount of prognostic information for nonoperative survival. (b) The various prognostic indices do have differences and contain independent information. Often 20% or more of the joint prognostic information in a pair of variables is lost by using only one variable. (c) To characterize survival optimally it is important to include a measure of left ventricular function together with arteriographic findings. (d) We suggest that a simple useful set of prognostic indices that are easily obtained from the angiography consists of left ventricular wall motion score, the number of vessels diseased, and the number of proximal arterial segments diseased. These indices provide good discrimination of patients with coronary artery disease who are at high and low risk.
APPENDIX I
Computation of the arteriographic indices
This appendix defines the eight arteriographic indices studied. The 27 possible segments with associated numbers, mnemonics, and brief descriptions are described first:
1. PRXRCA (proximal right coronary artery). Main stem of RCA from the ostium to one half the distance to the acute margin of the heart.
2. MIDRCA (middle RCA). Main stem of RCA from end of above segment to acute margin of the heart.
3. DSTRCA (distal RCA). Main stem of RCA usually running along the posterior right atrioventricular groove, from the acute margin of the heart to the origin of the posterior descending artery (PDA).
4. RPDA (right PDA). Artery of the posterior interventricular groove, which gives off septal perforators and is supplied by the distal right (90%).
5. RPLS (right posterolateral segment). Continuation of the distal right beyond the origin of the posterior descending artery. This segment is situated in the posterior atrioventricular groove, in the region of the crux of the heart, and may have an inverted U-shaped configuration. It usually gives off the A-V node artery and a variable number of branches, which run parallel to the PDA, on the posterolateral surface (or inferior surface) of the left ventricle.
6. RPL1 (first RPLS branch). First branch off the RPLS and often the only branch; synonym, left ventricular branch.
7. RPL2 (second RPLS branch). Usually not present. 8. RPL3 (third RPLS branch). Usually not present. 9. Inf Septal (inferior septal). Posterior descending septal arteries are the septal perforator arteries originating from the PDA then extending into the inferior septunm. 10. AC MARG (acute marginal vessels). A large branch or branches supplying the acute marginal wall of the right ventricle. The origin of the largest of these vessels may be variable, but usually coincides with the acute margin of the heart. These vessels are often an important source of collateral circulation. 11. LMCA (left main coronary artery). Aortic ostium to bifurcation. 12. PRXLAD (proximal left anterior descending). Extends from its origin off the left coronary artery to the first visible septal no matter how small this vessel is. In some cases there will be a major septal proceeded by one or more small septals. In this instance, the definition should still be rigidly adhered to and the first visible septal, no matter what size, should be used to indicate the end of the proximal segment of the LAD. 13. MIDLAD (middle LAD). LAD immediately distal to the origin of the first major septal branch and extending to a point where the LAD forms an angle (Right anterior oblique [RAO] view), often, but not always, coinciding or close to the origin of the second diagonal branch. If said angle or branch is not identifiable, the segment ends one half the distance from the first major septal to the apex of the heart. 14. DSTLAD (distal LAD). Terminal segment of the LAD running along the interventricular sulcus, beginning with the end of the previous segment, and usually extending beyond the apex.

15. Ist DIAG (first diagonal; D-1). The largest, and usually the first, diagonal branch having its origin from the proximal segment of the LAD and supplying the anterior wall. Occasionally, a separate branch of the main left coronary artery. If there is no diagonal with its origin from the proximal LAD, then D-1 should be coded with a -5" under morphology of distal vessel to
signify anatomically not present. 16. 2nd DIAG (second diagonal; D-2). The second diagonal branch, which
often has its origin at the angle of the anterior descending when visualized in the RAO projection. Origin is usually near junction of middle and distal thirds
of LAD, but may come off higher, from MIDLAD.
17. Ist Ant Septal (first anterior septal). This vessel is designated as the first large branch of the LAD to penetrate into the anterior interventricular
septum.
18. PRXCX (proximal circumflex). That portion of the circumflex artery from its origin off the main left coronary artery to and including the origin of the first obtuse marginal branch (No. 20). The distal circumflex (No. 19)
may originate before the first marginal but the proximal circumflex continues
until the origin of the first marginal. 19. DSTCX (distal circumflex). Begins from the proximal portion of the
circumflex as the circumflex runs along or close to the posterior left atrioventricular groove. In right dominant circulation, the distal circumflex may be
very small or absent. Marginal circumflex branches that are very small or "twigs" are not to be
counted as marginals or described. The first marginal branch (No. 20) may sometimes be a very large branch with the second marginal (No. 21) appearing as a division of the first marginal. All branches that come off the distal cir-
cumflex will be labeled marginals (Nos. 20, 21, and 22 below), and all branches that come off the left atrioventricular artery will be labeled left posterolateral branches (No. 24, 25, and 26 below).
20. Ist OB MARC (first obtuse marginal). The first major branch of the circumflex artery supplying the lateral left ventricular wall, in the general
area of the obtuse margin of the heart. 21. 2nd OB MARC (second obtuse marginal). The second branch of the
circumflex distributing to the lateral surface of the ventricle. Sometimes smaller in caliber than the first obtuse marginal. May be absent or may be a division of the first obtuse marginal branch.
22. 3rd OB MARC (third obtuse marginal). The third branch of the cir-
cumflex supplying the posterolateral left ventricular wall (often absent). Runs
parallel to the LPDA in the left predominant pattern. 23. LAV (left atrial ventricular artery). The left atrial ventricular artery
is present only in a left dominant or balanced circulation. This artery is a continuation of the distal circumflex and has been arbitrarily defined as the distal half of the remainder of the circumflex after the take-off of the first marginal. The proximal half of the circumflex after the take-off of the first marginal will be defined as the distal circumflex (No. 19). Note that this definition is appropriate only for left dominant or balanced circulation.
Left posterolateral branches that are very small or "twigs" are not to be counted as branches or described. The first left posterolateral branch (No. 24) may sometimes be a very large branch with the second left posterolateral branch (No. 25) appearing as a division of the first branch. All branches that come off the distal circumflex will be labeled marginals (No. 20, 21, and 22), and all branches that come off the left atrioventricular artery will be labeled left posterolateral branches (Nos. 24, 25, and 26).
24. 1st LPL (first left posterolateral branch). First branch off the LPL segment and often the only branch; synonym, left ventricular branch.
25. 2nd LPL (second left posterolateral branch). Second branch off the
LPL segment. 26. 3rd LPL (third left posterolateral branch). Third branch off the LPL
segment. Usually not present. 27. LPDA (left PDA). Posterior descending when present as a branch of
the circumflex in the predominant left coronary artery. The pattern of dominance in the circulatory system is defined as follows. 1. Left. The left atrioventricular and posterior descending arteries origi-
nate from the left circumflex coronary artery. Thus, segments Nos. 23 and 27 must be present and segments Nos. 4 and 5 should not be present.
2. Right. The posterior descending and the right posterolateral segments originate from the right coronary artery. Thus, segment Nos. 4 and 5 must be present and segment Nos. 23 and 27 should not be present.
3. Balanced. The right coronary artery gives a posterior descending artery, which does not extend beyond the crux. The left circumflex gives the posterolateral branches and rarely a second posterior descending as well. Thus, segment Nos. 4 and 23 will always be present, segment No. 27 may rarely be present, but segment No. 5 should not be present.
The eight indices and their computation follow.

1. NUMBER OF VESSELS DISEASED
The number of diseased vessels is a measure of the extent of disease in the three major branches of the coronary arteries. The three major vessels referred to by single, double, and triple vessel disease are determined by dominance. In a right dominant, balanced, or unknown system, these three branches include the RCA, the LAD, and the left circumflex arteries. In a left dominant circulation, they include the left anterior descending artery, the proximal left circumflex and its marginal branches, and the distal left circumflex and its posterolateral branches. The LMCA is equivalent to three vessels in a left dominant circulation and two vessels in a right dominant, balanced, or unknown circulation.
In a right dominant, balanced, or unknown circulation, the number of diseased vessels is determined in the following manner. The right coronary artery is considered diseased if there is a 270% stenosis in the proximal, mid, or distal right coronary arteries, or the RPDA; this constitutes one diseased vessel. If the LMCA has a 50% or greater stenosis, this constitutes an additional two diseased vessels. If the LMCA is not diseased or has <50% stenosis and there exists a stenosis of 70% or greater in the proximal, mid, or distal LAD or the first or second diagonal, there is one diseased vessel. If there is a stenosis of 70% or greater in the PRX or DSTCX, or in one of the three OB MARG, then the left circumflex is diseased; this constitutes one diseased vessel.
In left dominance, the number of diseased vessels is determined in the following fashion. If the left main coronary artery has a stenosis 2 50%, this constitutes three vessel disease. The remaining arteries are considered only if the LMCA has <50% stenosis. The criteria for defining disease in the LAD are the same as in a right dominant circulation. If there is a stenosis of 70% or greater in the proximal or distal circumflex arteries, this counts as two vessel disease. The remaining arteries are considered only if the PRX or DSTCX arteries are not diseased. If there is a stenosis of 70% or greater in the first, second, or third OB MARG, there is one diseased vessel. Finally, if there is a stenosis of 70% or greater in the left atrial ventricular artery, the first, second, or third posterolateral branches, or the LPDA, this constitutes an additional diseased vessel.
2. NUMBER OF PROXIMAL ARTERIAL
SEGMENTS DISEASED
In a right, balanced, or unknown dominance system, a LMCA that is 270% counts as two proximal segments diseased. If in addition the PRXRCA is .70% there are three proximal segments diseased. If LMCA is <70%, the number of proximal segments diseased is the number of the PRXRCA, PRXLAD, and PRXCX with 270% stenosis.
In a left dominant system, LMCA that are 270% count as three proximal segments diseased. If the LMCA is <70%, PRXLAD that are 270% count as one diseased proximal segment; if the PRXCX is 709% two diseased proximal segments are counted. If PRXCX is <70%, then one proximal segment diseased is counted if DSTCX is 270%.

RCA. For the RCA to obtain this score, segments PRXRCA, MIDRCA, DSTRCA, and RPDA must all have 0% stenosis.
LAD. For the LAD to obtain this score, segments LMCA, PRXLAD, MIDLAD, DSTLAD, DIAGI, and DIAG2 must all have 0% stenosis.
CX. For the CX to obtain this score, segments LMCA, PRXCX, DISTCX, OBMRG1, OBMRG2, and OBMRG3 must all have 0% stenosis.
1: Trivial irregularity(ies) in luminal diameter. RCA. At least one of segments PRXRCA, MIDRCA, DSTRCA, or RPDA
has stenosis 1-29%, all have <30% stenosis. LAD. At least one of segments LMCA, PRXLAD, MIDLAD, DSTLAD,
DIAGI, or DIAG2 has stenosis 1-29%, all have <30% stenosis. CX. At least one of segments LMCA, PRXCX, DISTCX, OBMRG1,
OBMRG2, or OBMRG3 has stenosis 1-29%, all have <30% stenosis.
2: Localized narrowing estimated to be >50% but <90% of the luminal (crosssectional) area (i.e., stenosis 30-68%).
RCA. At least one of segments PRXRCA, MIDRCA, DSTRCA, or RPDA has stenosis 30-68%, all have <69% stenosis.
LAD. At least one of segments LMCA, PRXLAD, MIDLAD, DSTLAD, DIAGI, or DIAG2 has stenosis 30-68%, all have <69% stenosis.
CX. At least one of segments LMCA, PRXCX, DISTCX, OBMRG1, OBMRG2, or OBMRG3 has stenosis 30-68%, all have <69% stenosis.
3: Multiple narrowing in the same vessel estimated to be >50% and <90% in cross-sectional area. The segment has a lesion with morphology coded as multiple, diffuse, or tubular lesion(s); or two segments with stenosis 30-68%.
RCA. The algorithm looks at segments PRXRCA, MIDRCA, DSTRCA, and RPDA to see if the above conditions are met.
LAD. The algorithm looks at segments LMCA, PRXLAD, MIDLAD, DSTLAD, DIAGI, and DIAG2.
CX. The algorithm looks at segments LMCA, PRXCX, DISTCX, OBMRG1, OBMRG2, and OBMRG3.
4: Narrowing or narrowings estimated to be >90% of the luminal cross section
area.
RCA. At least one of segments PRXRCA, MIDRCA, DSTRCA, or RPDA has stenosis 69-100% and PRXRCA <100%.
LAD. At least one of segments LMCA, PRXLAD, MIDLAD, DSTLAD, DIAGI, or DIAG2 has stenosis 69-100% and LMCA <100% and PRXLAD <100%.
CX. At least one of segments LMCA, PRXCX, DISTCX, OBMRG1, OBMRG2, or OBMRG3 has stenosis 69-100% and LMCA <100% and PRXCX
<100%.
5: Total obstruction of a vessel without any filling of the distal segment from the proximal portion.
RCA. Segment PRXRCA = 100%. LAD. Segment LMCA or PRXLAD = 100%. CX. Segment LMCA or PRXCX = 100%.

3. PROXIMAL ARTERIAL SEGMENT SCORE
The score ranges from 1-7. The criteria for reduction of the internal diameters were the same as for the number of vessels diseased (Index 1). The definitions of the proximal segments of the coronary arteries were the same as for number of proximal vessel segments diseased.
Score 1. No proximal segment diseased. Score 2. One proximal segment diseased, either the circumflex coronary artery, CX, or RCA. Score 3. Proximal segment of LAD diseased. Score 4. Proximal segments diseased in both the CX and RCA. Score 5. Proximal segment diseased in LAD and in CX or RCA. Score 6. LMCA diseased. Score 7. Three proximal segments diseased with or without a diseased LMCA.
4. FRIESINGER INDEX
The Friesinger Index is a score ranging from 0 to 15. Each of the three main arteries of the heart is scored separately receiving a score from zero to five.
0: An artery will obtain a score of 0 if there are no arteriographic abnormalities seen.

Note: In 5 above only the proximal segments were used, unlike 0-4 which use the whole vessel. Note: In 3 above, segments with stenosis of 30-49% were considered to have a single lesion only. This was necessary because the morphology variable is not filled out for this group in the CASS study.
5. MODIFIED GENSINI INDEX
Each arterial segment is weighted by a value from 0.5 to 5.0. (The weight for segments 1 through 4 is changed to 0.5 if the system is left dominant.) The stenosis is weighted from 2 to 64. The product of these two weights is the total weight for each arterial segment. The modified Gensini index is the sum of the total weights for each segment.
The segment weights are (segment, weight): 1 PRXRCA, 1.0; 2 MIDRCA, 1.0; 3 DSTRCA, 1.0; 4 RPDA, 1.0; 5 RPLS, 0.5; 6 RPL1, 0.5; 7 RPL2, 0.5; 9 8 RPL3, 0.5; 10 AC MARG, 0.5; 11 LMCA, 5.0; 12 PRXLAD, 2.5; 13 MIDLAD, 1.5; 14 DSTLAD, 1.0; 15 1st DIAG, 1.0; 16 2nd DIAG, 0.5; 17 1st Ant Septal, 0.5; 18 PRXCX, 2.5; 19 DSTCX, 1.0; 20 1st OB Marg, 1.0; 21 2nd OB Marg, 0.5; 22 3rd OB Marg, 0.5; 23 LAV, 0.5; 24 1st LPL, 0.5; 25 2nd LPL, 0.5; 26 3rd LPL, 0.5; 27 LPDA, 1.0.
The stenosis weights are (percentage stenosis, weight): 0-25, 2; 26-50, 4; 51-75, 8; 76-90, 16; 91-99, 32; 100, 64.

For each path in the diagram, calculate the product of the W, and sum the products for each path. The sum is then multiplied by a constant to normalize the values to fall between 0 and 100.

7. MODIFIED NHCH INDEX
The Modified NHCH index uses empirically derived weights. The products associated with different paths in Figs. 3 and 4 were used as potential covariates in a stepwise Cox survival analysis. Cases with left dominant coronary systems were analyzed separately from the cases with right, balanced, or unknown dominance. Using the notation of the NHCH index, for right, balanced and unknown dominance the resulting index is:
Modified NU1C'I = 0.096(W,W,W3W4) + 0.134(W,,W,2W,3W,4)
+ 0.045(W,,W,,W,,) + 0.031(W,,W,sW,) + 0.022(W,,W1sW21)-
For left dominance,
Modified NHCII = 0.109(W IW 12W W 4) + 0.120(W,I W IIsW WW )
8. ARTERIAL SEGMENT SCORE
The percent stenoses in each segment 1-27 were used as potential covariates in a stepwise Cox survival analysis. The cases with left dominant coronary systems were analyzed separately from the cases with right, balanced, or unkriown dominance. The segments selected by the stepwise procedure and their estimated coefficients are given below. For right, balanced and unknown dominance,
Score = 0.086(% LMCA) + 0.090(% PRXLAD) + 0.060(% PRXRCA) + 0.044(% PRXCX) + 0.046(% MIDLAD) + 0.039(% DSTCX) + 0.019(% MIDRCA) + 0.034(% OBMRG1) + 0.019(% OBMARG2) + 0.030(% OBMARG3).
For left dominance,
Score = 0.071(% PRXLAD) + 0.094(% PRXCX) + 0.066(% DISTCX).
APPENDIX II
Quantification of the predictive information (13)
If each patient can belong to one of two populations (in this case, alive or dead), let X and Y be discrete variables related to the two populations. Let P,(i, j) be the proportion or probability of dead (r = 1) or alive (r = 2) cases with X = i and Y = j. The joint information in X and Y for distinguishing between populations 1 and 2 is:
I.,, In (P,(i, j)/P2(i, j))(P,(i, j) -P2(c, j))
(In this expression In is the natural logarithm.) The information in X alone for distinguishing between dead or alive is given by:
1. = z In (P,(i)/Ps(i)(P,(i) -P20)),

where P,(i) is the proportion of population r cases with X = i. A similar expression gives I,, the Y information. The percentage of the joint XY infor-
mation contained in variable X is defined to be 100(1,/I,,).
To estimate the probabilities P from the data, each of two indices was used to group the cases into approximate quintiles of risk. (Instead of quintiles, categories for number of vessels diseased, number of proximal vessel segments diseased, and the proximal vessel segment score were simply formed by the different values of the index.) The life table method was used to estimate 6-y survival in each cell. Let S(i, j) be the estimated 6-yr survival in cell i, j. Let n,1 be the number of individuals in the i, j cell at time zero. The probabilities P,(i, j) and P2(i, j) are estimated by
P,(i, j) = n,(l - S(i, j))/2 nk,-(l - S(k, in))
PO(l, J) = ni,S(i, j)/ nk,,,,S(k, m), L-
