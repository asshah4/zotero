    Abstract 
    Brain injury following transient or permanent focal cerebral ischaemia (stroke) develops from a complex series of pathophysiological events that evolve in time and space. In this article, the relevance of excitotoxicity, peri-infarct depolarizations, inflammation and apoptosis to delayed mechanisms of damage within the peri-infarct zone or ischaemic penumbra are discussed. While focusing on potentially new avenues of treatment, the issue of why many clinical stroke trials have so far proved disappointing is addressed. This article provides a framework that can be used to generate testable hypotheses and treatment strategies that are linked to the appearance of specific pathophysiological events within the ischaemic brain.

    Adaptation to myocardial stress in disease states: is preconditioning a healthy heart phenomenon?

    Abstract 
    Effective therapeutic strategies for protecting the ischaemic myocardium are much sought after. Ischaemic heart disease in humans is a complex disorder, often associated with other systemic diseases such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes that exert multiple biochemical effects on the heart, independently of ischaemia. Ischaemic preconditioning of myocardium is a well-described adaptive response in which brief exposure to ischaemia markedly enhances the ability of the heart to withstand a subsequent ischaemic insult. The underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon have been extensively investigated in the hope of identifying new rational approaches to therapeutic protection of the ischaemic myocardium. However, most studies have been undertaken in animal models in which ischaemia is imposed in the absence of other disease processes. In this article, Peter Ferdinandy, Zoltan Szilvassy and Gary Baxter review the ways in which systemic diseases might modify the preconditioning response and they emphasize the importance of further preclinical studies that specifically examine preconditioning in relation to complicating disease states.

    Animal models of stroke: do they have value for discovering neuroprotective agents?

    Abstract 
    There has been a series of high-profile failures of drugs in clinical trials of acute ischaemic stroke that were designed to meet criteria necessary for drug regulatory approval. This has, again, called into question the value of animal models for identifying effective neuroprotective agents. Here, we review evidence that physiological changes (reperfusion, hyperglycaemia, hypothermia and blood pressure) produce comparable changes in outcome in both animal models and human stroke patients, which indicates that the models should identify clinically effective neuroprotective agents. We suggest that most clinical failures have occurred because compounds were administered differently in animal and clinical studies. We review earlier guidelines on the information that is necessary from preclinical studies before a compound enters clinical trials, and propose modifications to these guidelines.

Abstract 
 
A general consensus is being reached on the use of a combination of mortality and functional end-points in clinical trials of neuroprotective agents. However, to date, few preclinical studies have examined the effects of putative neuroprotective agents on functional outcome after ischaemia. The data described in this review show the importance of combining both histopathological and neurobehavioural studies when evaluating the neuroprotective efficacy of anti-ischaemic agents in animal models of cerebral ischaemia. Here, Jackie Hunter, Ken Mackay and Derek Rogers argue that measures of functional improvement in models of ischaemia should be incorporated to characterize further the neuroprotection afforded by a compound that could aid the selection of doses and end-point measures in early clinical trials.
