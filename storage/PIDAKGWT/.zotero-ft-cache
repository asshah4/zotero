Abstract 
In Mandarin Chinese, speakers benefit from fore-knowledge of what the first syllable but not of what the first phonemic segment of a disyllabic word will be (Chen, Chen, & Dell, 2002), contrasting with findings in English, Dutch, and other Indo-European languages, and challenging the generality of current theories of word production. In this article, we extend the evidence for the language difference by showing that failure to prepare onsets in Mandarin (Experiment 1) applies even to simple monosyllables (Experiments 2–4), and confirm the contrast with English for comparable materials (Experiments 5 and 6). We also provide new evidence that Mandarin speakers do reliably prepare tonally unspecified phonological syllables (Experiment 7). To account for these patterns, we propose a language general proximate units principle whereby intentional preparation for speech as well as phonological–lexical coordination are grounded at the first phonological level below the word at which explicit unit selection occurs. The language difference arises because syllables are proximate units in Mandarin Chinese, whereas segments are proximate in English and other Indo-European languages. The proximate units perspective reconciles the aspiration toward a language general account of word production with the reality of substantial cross-linguistic differences.

Abstract 
Summary 
Evidence regarding visually guided limb movements suggests that the motor system learns and maintains neural maps between motor commands and sensory feedback [1, 2 and 3]. Such systems are hypothesized to be used in a feed-forward control strategy that permits precision and stability without the delays of direct feedback control [4]. Human vocalizations involve precise control over vocal and respiratory muscles. However, little is known about the sensorimotor representations underlying speech production. Here, we manipulated the heard fundamental frequency of the voice during speech to demonstrate learning of auditory-motor maps. Mandarin speakers repeatedly produced words with specific pitch patterns (tone categories). On each successive utterance, the frequency of their auditory feedback was increased by 1/100 of a semitone until they heard their feedback one full semitone above their true pitch. Subjects automatically compensated for these changes by lowering their vocal pitch. When feedback was unexpectedly returned to normal, speakers significantly increased the pitch of their productions beyond their initial baseline frequency. This adaptation was found to generalize to the production of another tone category. However, results indicate that a more robust adaptation was produced for the tone that was spoken during feedback alteration. The immediate aftereffects suggest a global remapping of the auditory-motor relationship after an extremely brief training period. However, this learning does not represent a complete transformation of the mapping; rather, it is in part target dependent.

Abstract 
The goal of this study is to investigate whether different types of structures and lexical tones of Chinese characters cause different processing fluency. In Experiment 1, participants’ explicit affective assessments of Chinese characters with different structures, frequencies, and lexical tones were analyzed. Results indicated that participants showed explicit preferences and dispreferences to different structures and lexical tones. In Experiment 2, participants’ implicit responses to different structures and lexical tones were investigated using a metaphor experimental paradigm. Results were consistent with the major findings of Experiment 1. In Experiments 3 and 4, participants’ recognition of words of different structures and lexical tones were analyzed. Results revealed that participants had a better memory for Surround structure characters when stimuli were visually presented and for Tone 3 when stimuli were auditorily presented. Finally, the significance and implications of this study are discussed.

Realisation of two adjacent high tones: Acoustic evidence from Northern Sotho 
Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies , Volume 28, Issue 2, 2010, Pages 101-121 
 
Abstract 
We present findings of a multi-speaker production study that was undertaken to investigate the realisation of two adjacent high tones within the verb word in Northern Sotho, a Southern Bantu language. Experimental tokens are selected to ensure that the high tones originate from different combinations of morphosyntactic constituents. It is found that the morphosyntactic constituency determines how the adjacent high tones are realised. When both high tones originate within either the inflectional stem or the macrostem constituents, a single pitch peak is realised. Additionally, when the macrostem contains two high tones, the tone of the object concord is absorbed into the stem. Two adjacent high tones, of which one stems from the inflectional stem and the other from the macrostem, produce two pitch peaks, with the latter of the two delayed in order to satisfy the Obligatory Contour Principle. These generalisations are supported by acoustic data. A set of rules is formulated that describes the surface realisation of adjacent high tones in the verbal domain of Northern Sotho (with the exception of one unresolved issue). © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

Prosodic encoding of topic and focus and its influence on speech perception in split sentences of Chinese Putonghua 
Shengxue Xuebao/Acta Acustica , Volume 35, Issue 6, November 2010, Pages 694-700 
 
Abstract 
The present study is an investigation of the prosodic encoding of split noun sentences in Putonghua, for instance, `shu, wo mai le san ben (Book, I have bought three).' in which the split noun is to highlight the corresponding information. The question and answer paradigm was used to induce contexts where the split noun was either topic or focus of the sentence. The speech production results of 280 split sentences read by 7 speakers show that: (1) In the two conditions, the split noun itself does not differ in either F0 or duration, (2) Compared to the intonational contours of the focus context, those of the topic context have higher maximum F0 in the base parts and shorter silence after the split noun. The prosodic domain of topic is within itself, whereas that of focus is the whole sentence. The perception experiment shows that the difference of prosody between the two conditions is perceivable, as matched question and statement is preferred.

Abstract 
We report data on post-focus realization of lexical tones in Standard Chinese, comparing them to their counterparts in the pre-focus and on-focus conditions reported in Chen and Gussenhoven (2008). While post-focus lexical tones are often realized with a compressed F0 range as observed in prior studies, in some tonal contexts, their F0 range is expanded. In addition, some post-focus tones also show a long-lasting effect of the preceding tone, but with a pattern different from the usual tonal co-articulation effect. What consistently differentiates the post-focus from the on-focus condition is the degree of distinctiveness in the lexical tonal contours, in particular when the preceding focused tone is High. These data suggest that F0 range compression is not the only and primary characteristic of post-focus tonal realization. Rather, the observed post-focus effects may be viewed as the multifaceted manifestations of weak implementation of post-focus tonal targets, as they are associated with prosodically non-prominent constituents. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract 
Connected discourse has a number of substantial effects on tone. First, the ideal form of tone is routinely compromised due to articulatory sluggishness. Second, the underlying tonal target is sometimes changed. Third, the surface tonal form is further distorted by other linguistic functions that also change pitch either deliberately or inadvertently. This article discusses how the surface acoustic form of tone can be understood in terms of the interaction between tone and these relatively independent processes.

Abstract 
Tone is the linguistic use of pitch to distinguish the meanings of words. It is used in some 70% of the world's languages. It is controlled by the larynx and arose historically from the influence of laryngeal contrasts (such as voicing) in consonants. Languages may contrast at least four levels, and at least two different rises or falls. In phonology, tone acts largely independently of the segments of the word, showing remarkable mobility and stability under segmental deletion. Rising and falling tones are not indivisible but arise when two different level tones appear on the same syllable. Conversely, one tone can spread over several syllables, creating a tonal plateau.

Abstract 
This article reviews the range of syllable types in the world's languages in relation to sound patterns or properties typically associated with syllables. These include sonority, general phonotactics, feature-based phonotactics, and weight. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the extent to which syllable types vary crosslinguistically, and to highlight crosslinguistic generalizations. Exceptions to universal tendencies are noted, as are languages with sound patterns at the typological extremes.

Abstract 
When seen from the point of view of the phonology, the suprasegmental features (i.e., pitch, duration, intensity) are involved in the realization of the prosodic structure of languages. This structure consists of the prosodic hierarchy and an autosegmental tonal structure. The prosodic hierarchy consists of a set of hierarchical constituents: mora, syllable, foot, phonological word, phonological phrase, intonational phrase, utterance, while additionally clitic group and accentual phrase have been argued for. These constituents may define the context of segmental or prosodic processes like consonant assimilation and stress shift, while the higher ones are characterized by preboundary lengthening. The tonal structure is a string of tones parallel to the segmental string. If tone enters into the specification of (also segmentally specified) morphemes, the language is a tone language. Languages vary in tonal density, or the number of locations where tone is specified. Pitch accent languages specify one location in the word for lexical tone. Focus, the marking of information status, is frequently expressed prosodically, for example, through phrasing, special pitch accents, or deaccentuation. The tonal phonology of languages will leave speakers free to use pitch variation for the expression of universal, ethologically developed meanings in the phonetic implementation.

Abstract 
Speech is reviewed as an inherently multidisciplinary subject embracing aspects of the life sciences, the social sciences, and the physical sciences. Topics addressed in this article include questions concerning why people study speech, how speech evolved, the functions of speech, the scope of phonetic theory, and the nature of variation and change in speech. Functional equivalences between different motor actions in speech, and between different perceptual apprehensions in listening to speech, are considered. The integration of speech with other channels of communication, such as gesture, is described. Finally, the partial success of speech technology is assessed.
