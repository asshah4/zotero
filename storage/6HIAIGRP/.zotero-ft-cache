Abstract 
In this paper, we explore how observers of a reach-to-grasp action can identify and distinguish between the agent and patient (i.e. target) of the action. We investigate the hypothesis that there is a characteristic sequential structure to the observer’s pattern of saccades, with the agent being fixated first, and then the target. We report an experiment which indicates that this sequence of saccades, while not ubiquitous, is overwhelmingly more likely than chance. The experiment also sheds some light on the mechanisms which allow the observer to saccade from the agent of the action to the target.

Abstract 
This paper reviews the role of vision in controlling pointing and reaching movements in man. Studies of visuomotor behaviour in normal subjects allow the identification of several levels for describing organization of visuomotor control. (1) The relative contribution of central (programming) and peripheral (feedback) mechanisms; (2) the role of the eye-head coordinated position as a reference for controlling accuracy and direction of movements; and (3) the relative independence of input-output channels in controlling proximal and distal segments of the musculature. These levels represent a useful framework for understanding pathological disruption of visuomotor control produced by cortical lesions.

Abstract 
This study aimed at evaluating the role of proprioception in the process of matching the final position of one’s limbs with an intentional movement. Two experiments were realised with the same paradigm of conscious recognition of one’s own limb position from a distorted position. In the first experiment, 22 healthy subjects performed the task in an active and in a passive condition. In the latter condition, proprioception was the only available information since the central signals related to the motor command were likely to be absent. The second experiment was realised with a deafferented patient who suffers from a complete haptic deafferentation, including loss of proprioception. The results first argue in favour of a dominant role of proprioception in action recognition, but they also stress the possible role of central signals. The process of matching the final position of one’s limbs with an intended movement and thus of action recognition would be achieved through a comparison process between the predicted sensory consequences of the action, which are stored in its internal model, and the actual sensory consequences of that action.

Abstract 
The end positions of eye and hand movements were both drawn towards a distracter that was presented nearby the target. They thus showed a so-called global effect. In contrast, perception was not influenced by the presence of a distracter. These results are discussed with regard to the question whether eye, hand, and perception are based on shared or separate target representations and readout triggers. We conclude that separate representations and readout triggers for eye and hand are the most likely case.

Abstract 
Action recognition has become a very important topic in computer vision, with many fundamental applications, in robotics, video surveillance, human–computer interaction, and multimedia retrieval among others and a large variety of approaches have been described. The purpose of this survey is to give an overview and categorization of the approaches used. We concentrate on approaches that aim on classification of full-body motions, such as kicking, punching, and waving, and we categorize them according to how they represent the spatial and temporal structure of actions; how they segment actions from an input stream of visual data; and how they learn a view-invariant representation of actions.

First person experience of body transfer in virtual reality 
PLoS ONE , Volume 5, Issue 5, 2010 
 
Abstract 
Background: Altering the normal association between touch and its visual correlate can result in the illusory perception of a fake limb as part of our own body. Thus, when touch is seen to be applied to a rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding hidden real hand, an illusion of ownership of the rubber hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand. This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution illusions. However, such studies have only ever manipulated a single factor and although they used a form of virtual reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual reality (IVR) to produce radical transformations in body ownership. Principal Findings: Here we show that a first person perspective of a life-sized virtual human female body that appears to substitute the male subjects' own bodies was sufficient to generate a body transfer illusion. This was demonstrated subjectively by questionnaire and physiologically through heart-rate deceleration in response to a threat to the virtual body. This finding is in contrast to earlier experimental studies that assume visuotactile synchrony to be the critical contributory factor in ownership illusions. Our finding was possible because IVR allowed us to use a novel experimental design for this type of problem with three independent binary factors: (i) perspective position (first or third), (ii) synchronous or asynchronous mirror reflections and (iii) synchrony or asynchrony between felt and seen touch. Conclusions: The results support the notion that bottom-up perceptual mechanisms can temporarily override top down knowledge resulting in a radical illusion of transfer of body ownership. The research also illustrates immersive virtual reality as a powerful tool in the study of body representation and experience, since it supports experimental manipulations that would otherwise be infeasible, with the technology being mature enough to represent human bodies and their motion. © 2010 Slater et al.

Virtual hand illusion induced by visuomotor correlations 
PLoS ONE , Volume 5, Issue 4, 2010 
 
Abstract 
Background: Our body schema gives the subjective impression of being highly stable. However, a number of easily-evoked illusions illustrate its remarkable malleability. In the rubber-hand illusion, illusory ownership of a rubber-hand is evoked by synchronous visual and tactile stimulation on a visible rubber arm and on the hidden real arm. Ownership is concurrent with a proprioceptive illusion of displacement of the arm position towards the fake arm. We have previously shown that this illusion of ownership plus the proprioceptive displacement also occurs towards a virtual 3D projection of an arm when the appropriate synchronous visuotactile stimulation is provided. Our objective here was to explore whether these illusions (ownership and proprioceptive displacement) can be induced by only synchr
