Aortic valve calcium (AVC) is a strong predictor of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and is typically calculated by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). We propose a novel method using pixel density quantiﬁcation software to objectively quantify AVC by twodimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and distinguish severe from nonsevere AS. A total of 90 patients (mean age 76 § 10 years, 75% male, mean AV gradient 32 § 11 mmHg, peak AV velocity 3.6 § 0.6 m/s, AV area (AVA) 1.0 § 0.3 cm2, dimensionless index (DI) 0.27 § 0.08) with suspected severe aortic stenosis undergoing 2D echocardiography were retrospectively evaluated. Parasternal short axis aortic valve views were used to calculate a gain-independent ratio between the average pixel density of the entire aortic valve in short axis at end diastole and the average pixel density of the aortic annulus in short axis (2D-AVC ratio). The 2D-AVC ratio was compared to echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters associated with AS, MDCT AVC quantiﬁcation, and expert reader interpretation of AS severity based on echocardiographic AVC interpretation. The 2D-AVC ratio exhibited strong correlations with mean AV gradient (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), peak AV velocity (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), AVC quantiﬁed by MDCT (r = 0.71, p <0.001) and excellent accuracy in distinguishing severe from non-severe AS (area under the curve = 0.93). Conversely, expert reader interpretation of AS severity based on echocardiographic AVC was not signiﬁcantly related to AV mean gradient (t = 0.23, p = 0.64), AVA (t = 2.94, p = 0.11), peak velocity (t = 0.59, p = 0.46), or DI (t = 0.02, p = 0.89). In conclusion, these data suggest that the 2D-AVC ratio may be a complementary method for AS severity adjudication that is readily quantiﬁable at time of TTE. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a degenerative inﬂammatory process driven largely by ﬁbrosis and changes in calcium homeostasis leading to aortic valve (AV) calcium, thickening, and outﬂow obstruction.1,2 Stenosis severity is most commonly adjudicated via echocardiography using the peak aortic jet tract obstruction velocity, mean pressure gradient, aortic valve area (AVA), and dimensionless index (DI).3 Aortic valve calcium (AVC) is also utilized to adjudicate AS severity, and it is most commonly quantiﬁed by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT).4-8 Analogous transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) methods have been proposed previously to allow for real time AVC data similar to what MDCT provides.9 However, this method relies on three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic techniques which may require additional training to incorporate into practice. We propose a simple, novel two-dimensional (2D) TTE method for AVC quantiﬁcation using a publicly

available pixel density software. This study compares AVC quantiﬁcation using pixel density with MDCT calcium quantiﬁcation and echocardiographic hemodynamic criteria for AS, and examines this method’s ability to distinguish severe from non-severe AS.
Methods
Patients with suspected severe aortic stenosis undergoing 2D echocardiography for work up were retrospectively evaluated at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Hospital in Chicago, IL between 2017 and 2020. This study was approved by the institutional review board. Of the 100 patients initially evaluated for inclusion, 90 had adequate short axis TTE images for analysis. Ten patients were excluded due to excessive acoustic shadowing on short axis TTE images of the AV that precluded accurate AV pixel density analysis and AVC quantiﬁcation.
Echocardiography studies were performed at our institution by trained sonographers using a commercially available echocardiography system. A standardized, comprehensive imaging protocol that included detailed assessments of valvular and ventricular function was employed according to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines.

with echocardiographic image interpretation to decrease reader to reader variability. To meet inclusion criteria, patients were required to have echocardiographic evidence of severe AS which was deﬁned as at least one of the following: mean transvalvular gradient ≥40 mmHg, peak transvalvular velocity ≥ 4 m/s, AVA ≤ 1 cm2, DI ≤ 0.25, or suspected severe AS with likely low ﬂow states or poor Doppler windows. Only patients with a majority of the annulus visible on short axis images were included to allow for an adequate gain baseline and those with acoustic shadowing limiting annulus visualization were excluded. A ratio between the average pixel density of the AV and that of the aortic annulus itself was calculated to produce a gain and gray-scale independent ratio (2D-AVC ratio, Figure 1).
Two expert readers independently analyzed the 2D short axis AV TTE images to assess for the presence of severe or non-severe AS based on a qualitative interpretation of AVC severity by TTE. The expert readers were blinded to MDCT calcium score and TTE hemodynamic data.
Brightness or luminance of the light emitted by an LCD display corresponding to AVC was measured using the free, publicly available pixel density quantiﬁcation software, ImageJ (developed by the National Institute of Health- http://imagej.nih.gov./ij/docs/guide). Single parasternal short axis still frames of the AV in end-diastole in which the entire aortic annulus and leaﬂet tips were visible were chosen for each patient and analyzed using ImageJ. The average pixel density of the short axis AV was measured and recorded as the mean grayscale value, with 0 representing a black pixel and 255 representing a white pixel. The AV was deﬁned as the entire area contained within the roughly triangular geometric shape that resulted from tracing the aortic annulus in short axis with the “polygon” tool in ImageJ. The average pixel density of the aortic annulus itself was similarly measured using the “segmented line” tool in ImageJ. The “segmented line” tool measures the average pixel density only within the line itself that was traced around the aortic annulus (as opposed to the area of the entire roughly triangular shape obtained with the “polygon” tool).
Electrocardiographically-gated contrast enhanced MDCT (Revolution Evo CT 750HG; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) was used to quantify MDCT AV calcium score. A standardized acquisition protocol was used, acquiring 64 contiguous transverse slices (thickness 2.5 mm, 120 keV, 5

mAs, rotation time 0.35 s, ﬁeld of view = 25 cm). AVC measurements were performed ofﬂine on a dedicated workstation (Osirix version 12.0.0). All contrast enhanced computed tomography scans were performed within 3 months of TTE imaging for consideration of TAVR. MDCT calcium score is most typically obtained with non-contrast CT imaging, however alternative methods for contrast CT imaging have been published which we utilized in this study as only contrast enhanced imaging was available in our population.10 To subtract the contrast enhancement, a region of interest was obtained in the ascending aorta excluding valvular calcium to determine the mean Hounsﬁeld Unit (HU) value of the contrast enhancement. A calciﬁed AV lesion was deﬁned as more than three contiguous pixels with a peak of attenuation of the mean HU + 100 HU. MDCT calcium score was calculated by using the Agatston (AU) method, by adding up the score on each slice of the MDCT AV image. Extravalvular calcium (e.g., from the mitral valve annulus, the ascending aorta, and coronary arteries) was excluded.
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS (version 26, Armonk, New York) and R (version 4.0.3, Vienna, Austria). Data are presented as mean § SD or as percentages. 2D-AVC ratio and MDCT scores were compared with echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters using simple linear regression. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the accuracy of 2D-AVC ratio for identifying severe AS. Expert reader analysis was compared using Cohen’s Kappa statistic. Intraclass correlation was used to evaluate reproducibility of 2DAVC ratio measurements and MDCT calcium scoring. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
A total of 90 of the 100 screened patients with suspected severe aortic stenosis undergoing 2D echocardiography for work up met inclusion criteria and were retrospectively evaluated (10 patients excluded due to poor short axis images not amenable to 2D-AVC ratio quantiﬁcation). Baseline demographic, echocardiographic, and MDCT characteristics are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. MDCT calcium score averages were based on the 47 patients with CT angiography available for CT calcium score quantiﬁcation. The 2D-AVC ratio exhibited excellent correlation

with AVC quantiﬁed by MDCT (r = 0.71, p <0.001, Figure 2) and excellent accuracy in distinguishing severe from nonsevere AS (area under the curve = 0.93, Figure 3). The ideal cutoff value for 2D-AVC ratio to distinguish severe from non-severe AS was 0.96 (89% speciﬁcity, 89% sensitivity, Figure 3) for the overall population. Similar cutoffs were found when stratiﬁed by sex (0.95 cutoff, 83% sensitivity, 86% speciﬁcity for females; 0.97 cut off, 90% sensitivity, 87% speciﬁcity for males). AVC quantiﬁcation by 2D- AVC ratio and MDCT correlated well with multiple echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters including mean gradient (r = 0.72, p < 0.001 for 2D-AVC ratio and r = 0.66, p <0.001 for MDCT, Figure 4) and peak velocity (r = 0.74, p < 0.001 for 2D-AVC ratio and r = 0.68, p <0.001 for MDCT, Figure 4). There were less robust correlations with AVA (r = -0.23, p = 0.03 for 2D-AVC ratio and r = -0.12, p = 0.4 for MDCT) and dimensionless index (r = -0.23, r = 0.04 for

2D-AVC ratio and r = -0.20, p = 0.2 for MDCT). Univariate and multivariate regressions yielded no signiﬁcant relationships with demographic and baseline risk factor variables (age, sex, race, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or coronary artery disease) and the 2D-AVC ratio (r = 0.22, p = 0.64).
Expert reader analysis of AS severity based solely on qualitative TTE AVC assessment was also evaluated and compared to echocardiographic parameters associated with AS. Our expert reader assessment was not signiﬁcantly related to AV mean gradient (t = 0.23, p = 0.64), AVA (t = 2.94, p = 0.11), peak velocity (t = 0.59, p = 0.46) and DI (t = 0.02, p = 0.89). Similarly, we compared two independent expert reader analyses of AS severity based on qualitative AVC TTE assessment which revealed signiﬁcant disagreement (Kappa = 0.12). Additionally, expert reader analysis was not signiﬁcantly related to 2D-AVC ratio (t = 1.12, p = 0.31).

Intraclass correlation (ICC) was used to evaluate reproducibility of 2D-AVC ratio measurements in 10 random patients and demonstrated excellent reproducibility (ICC = 0.95, p <0.001 for intra-rater reliability and ICC = 0.71, p = 0.04 for inter-rater reliability).
Discussion
Our study revealed that the described 2D-AVC ratio correlates with MDCT calcium score and echocardiographic hemodynamic measures of AS. Consequently, the 2D-AVC ratio may provide a simple, gain-independent, quantitative bedside assessment of AVC that predicts AS severity. AVC as measured by both echocardiography and MDCT has previously been shown to predict progression of outcomes in patients with AS including death, need for AV replacement, and prosthetic valve regurgitation.6,11 In terms of AVC quantiﬁcation, TTE and more recently MDCT have been utilized. TTE techniques have ranged from visual estimation of AVC to more sophisticated techniques such as

integrated backscatter and 3D echocardiography calcium scoring.9,11,12 The more sophisticated methods such as integrated backscatter and 3D echocardiographic reconstruction require complex ofﬂine image analysis.9,12 These factors have limited these echocardiographic quantiﬁcation modalities from becoming routine measurements.9,11,12
In contrast to the limitations noted with echocardiography, AVC quantiﬁcation by MDCT allows for 3D visualization of the calcium contained within the AV and accurately discriminates AV from non-AV calcium. These previous MDCT studies were validated with non-contrast CT studies given the increased difﬁculty in distinguishing calcium from intravenous contrast by CT.6,13 Despite this difﬁculty, recent studies have established methods for determining AVC quantiﬁcation with contrast CT angiography which have been shown to correlate with non-contrast MDCT AVC quantiﬁcation.10,14 We employed AVC quantiﬁcation from our patients’ contrast pre-TAVR CT angiography to compare to the 2D-AVC ratio which did not include noncontrast studies. Although CT angiography based AVC

scores have been shown to correlate with non-contrast quantiﬁcation, we must emphasize that CT angiography is not the recommended method for AVC quantiﬁcation which is why we did not use this as a gold standard for AS severity in our study. The Agatston scores calculated in our study are generally higher than non-contrast studies (due to the contrast elevating the baseline Hounsﬁeld units) and must be interpreted with caution.
The 2D-AVC ratio exhibited a strong correlation with hemodynamic echocardiographic markers of AS and AVC as measured by MDCT calcium score. Pixel density as measured from ultrasound images of plated calcium has been shown to strongly correlate to both calcium weight and CT calcium score which is why this measurement was chosen to derive the 2D-AVC ratio.15 Pixel density quantiﬁcation has also previously been utilized in echocardiographic studies of aortic stenosis by measuring echocardiographic Doppler signals.16 Although previous echocardiographic techniques have been developed to quantify AVC, they require ofﬂine 3D image analysis and the authors do not supply a precise methodology for replicating their AVC quantiﬁcation9,12 This is not the case for our method which involves only two measurements from the short axis view of the aortic valve that we have given detailed instructions for obtaining previously in this article. Additionally, methods previously published regarding 3D echocardiographic AVC quantiﬁcation require preset gains. This is in contrast to the 2D-AVC ratio which is gain independent. Furthermore, the 2D-AVC ratio outperforms expert reader analysis of AS severity based on echocardiographic AVC assessment.
Although the 2D-AVC ratio exhibited strong correlations with echocardiographic measures of severe AS (mean gradient and peak velocity) and AVC as measured by MDCT, there were less robust with AVA and DI. We suspect the less robust correlation is due to the increased number of measurements needed to obtain AVA by the continuity equation and DI as opposed to single measurements need to mean gradient and peak velocity which may lead to more variability in measurements. Additionally, no signiﬁcant relationship was found between demographic and clinical characteristics (age, race, sex, presence of cardiovascular comorbidities) and the 2D-AVC ratio. In contrast to MDCT which shows a clear distinction in calcium score cut-offs for severe AS for males and females, we found a very similar 2D-AVC ratio cut off for males and females in our study. We suspect a larger cohort of patients is necessary to fully delineate these demographic relationships with the 2D-AVC ratio.
This study was limited by its retrospective nature and relatively small sample size (although this sample size is comparable to previous studies evaluating echocardiographic quantiﬁcation of AVC). The 2D-AVC ratio also relies on excellent short axis AV echocardiographic images with a clearly delineated annulus to serve as an echocardiographic gain baseline which may be difﬁcult to obtain in some patients due to body habitus. Additionally, this method needs to be evaluated in larger cohorts of patients utilizing multiple echocardiographic systems. The present study did not address clinical scenarios such as low-ﬂow, low-gradient AS but may be further explored in future studies similar to what has already been shown with MDCT.17

Additionally, acoustic shadowing limited us from performing a cusp by cusp echocardiographic calcium quantiﬁcation, which has been shown to be additive in the MDCT literature.18 Finally, this method needs to be validated in a wider spectrum of AS severity given the smaller number of non-severe AS patients in this study (38%) to better characterize the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of detecting severe AS with the 2D-AVC ratio.
In conclusion, the 2D-AVC ratio exhibits excellent correlations with MDCT calcium score, outperforms expert reader echocardiographic AVC interpretation, and can discriminate severe from non-severe AS. Our study suggests that the 2D-AVC ratio may be a complementary method for AS severity adjudication that is readily quantiﬁable at time of TTE.
