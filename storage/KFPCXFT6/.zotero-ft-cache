Abstract 
Many people have argued that natural categories are organized in terms of a family resemblance principle. Members of family resemblance categories tend to share properties with each other but have no properties that are singly necessary and jointly sufficient (defining) for category membership. This paper reports seven experiments using a sorting task to evaluate the conditions under which people prefer to construct categories according to a family resemblance principle. The first set of studies followed the typical practice of defining family resemblance in terms of independent sets of matching and mismatching values. Across a variety of stimulus materials, instructions, procedures, and category structures, family resemblance sorting was almost never observed. Despite procedures designed to prevent it, participants persisted in sorting on the basis of a single dimension. The second set of studies explored the idea that interproperty relationships rather than independent features serve to organize categories. We found that people will abandon unidimensional sorting in favor of sorting by correlated properties, especially when they can be causally connected. In addition, when conceptual knowledge is added which makes interproperty relationships salient, family resemblance sorting becomes fairly common. Implications of the results for the development of family resemblance categories and the practice of treating properties or features as additive and independent are discussed.

Abstract 
We invoke concepts from the theory of hypergraphs to give a measure of the closeness of family resemblance, and to make precise the idea of a composite likeness. It is shown that for any positive integer m , for any general term possessing any extent of family resemblance strictly greater than m , there is a taxonomical representation of the term whereby each subordinate taxon has an extent of family resemblance strictly greater than m .

Abstract 
Subsystems of category learning have been identified on the basis of general domains of content (e.g., tools, faces). The present study examined categories from the standpoint of internal structure and determined brain topography associated with expressing two fundamentally different category rule structures (criterion attribute, CA, and family resemblance, FR). CA category learning involves processing stimuli by isolated features and classifying by properties held by all members. FR learning involves processing stimuli by integral wholes and classifying on overall similarity among members without sharing identical features. fMRI BOLD response to CA and FR categorization was measured with pseudowords as stimuli. Category knowledge for both tasks was mastered prior to brain imaging. Areas of activation emerged unique to the structure of each category and followed from the nature of the rule abstraction procedure. CA categorization was implemented by strong target monitoring and expectation (medial parietal), rule maintenance in working memory, feature selection processes (inferior frontal), and a sensitivity to high frequency components of the stimulus such as isolated features (anterior temporal). FR categorization, consistent with its multi-featural nature, involved word-level processing (left extrastriate) that evoked articulatory rehearsal (medial cerebellar). The data suggest category structure is an important determinant of brain response during categorization. For instance, anterior temporal structures may help attune visual processing systems to high frequency components to support the learning of criterial, highly predictive rules.

Abstract 
Research on categorization indicates that 1 level of abstraction is "basic" in cognition. The concept of cue validity has been proposed as a quantitative measure of category differentiation that picks out basic categories. The author attempts to show that cue validity is not able to pick out the basic level because it can only increase for more inclusive categories. The value of quantitative measures in categorization research is discussed, and suggestions are made for research in this area.

Abstract 
A previous experiment (S. Wayland & J. E. Taplin, 1982, Brain and Language , 16 , 87–108) demonstrated that aphasic subjects had particular difficulty performing a categorization task, which for normals involves abstraction of a prototype from a set of patterns and sorting of other patterns with reference to this prototype. This study extended the investigation to a recognition memory task similarly organized in categorical structure. The aim was to replicate the previous findings and to delineate the precise nature of aphasics' difficulties with such tasks. Aphasics were again found to be aberrant in performing this task in comparison with normal subjects, nonaphasic brain-injured control subjects also demonstrating a departure from normality. The results suggest that the problem for brain-injured subjects is one of overselectivity in terms of the features of the stimuli to which they respond rather than a difficulty with prototype abstraction itself.

Food Quality and Preference , Volume 22, Issue 4, June 2011, Pages 371-383 
 
Abstract 
New meat substitutes need to be recognized as alternatives to meat. We therefore investigated which category representations consumers have of meat and meat substitutes. Thirty-four non-vegetarian participants performed a free sorting task with 17 meat products and 19 commercially available meat substitutes, followed by similarity and typicality ratings. Results indicated that categorization was largely influenced by the taxonomic classification of meat, so by categories that refer to the animal source like 'pork', 'beef' etc. Hence, meat substitutes were grouped separately from non-processed meat products. However, there were categories (e.g. 'pieces' and 'sausages') that contained both meat substitutes and processed meat products, as these products were perceived to be very similar.New meat substitutes should have a certain resemblance to meat in order to replace meat on the plate. This can be achieved by either similarity in appearance or by referring to shared scripts/goals, such as a similar application in meals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Category induction in autism: Slower, perhaps different, but certainly possible 
Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology , Volume 64, Issue 2, February 2011, Pages 311-327 
 
Abstract 
Available studies on categorization in autism indicate possibly intact category formation, performed through atypical processes. Category learning was investigated in 16 high-functioning autistic and 16 IQ-matched nonautistic participants, using a category structure that could generate a conflict between the application of a rule and exemplar memory. Same-different and matching-to-sample tasks allowed us to verify discrimination abilities for the stimuli to be used in category learning. Participants were then trained to distinguish between two categories of imaginary animals, using categorization tests early in the training and at the end (160 trials). A recognition test followed, in order to evaluate explicit exemplar memory. Similar discrimination performance was found in control tasks for both groups. For the categorization task, autistic participants did not use any identifiable strategy early in the training, but used strategies similar to those of the nonautistic participants by the end, with the same level of accuracy. Memory for the exemplars was poor in both groups. Our findings confirm that categorization may be successfully performed by autistics, but may necessitate longer exposure to material, as the top-down use of rules may be only secondary to a guessing strategy in autistics. © 2010 The Experimental Psychology Society.

Abstract 
Concepts form the building blocks of thought and this article demonstrates that concept learning is dynamic and complex. Various theories of concept representation and learning are reviewed, including classical, prototype, exemplar, and theory theories. Research suggests that the nature of conceptual organization changes as a function of expertise and cultural experience. Furthermore, research shows that individual goals influence the construction of concepts and that predisposed constraints on concept formation are specific to content domain. To illustrate the interaction between various factors in concept learning, we examine the domains of folk biology and mathematics and consider developmental and cross-cultural research.

Abstract 
‘Experiment’ is a category of study that has long stood at the heart of much work in science and technology studies. Its meaning, however, has changed over time, depending upon the overall analytical setting within which it has been invoked and provided with its significance for the understanding of science. This article follows the development of ideas about ‘experiment’ from its role in the mainstream Anglo-American philosophy of science of the 1950s and 1960s through to its reconsideration in the sociologically oriented work of the 1970s and 1980s, until its new, nuanced place in the understandings of science as practice and process that were developed during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s.

Abstract 
Concept and category learning is critical for intelligent thought and action. However, much of the laboratory work has focused only on classification learning, how people learn to assign category membership. This chapter attempts to integrate concept and category learning to the many cases in which it is critical in three ways. First, we examine other ways of learning, in which the categories are used to accomplish a goal. Second, we investigate more complex concepts and the use of prior knowledge. Third, we briefly consider the role of concept and category learning in problem solving and language use.

Abstract 
A concept is a mental representation of a class of entities. Natural concepts are the mental representations of classes that are found in nature, such as robins or sapphires. Concepts are critical for intelligent action—they allow us to treat some entities as equivalent with respect to some purpose. Concepts provide knowledge of how to classify new entities, plus are important for problem solving, explanation, prediction, and understanding. Three views of classification are contrasted: a definitional view, one in which a category is represented by a prototype, a summary representation of the most typical feature values, and one in which concepts are viewed as embedded in larger explanatory structures. The focus is then on how concepts are related in a hierarchy. Evidence is presented that one level of the hierarchy, the basic level (e.g., apple, rather than fruit or Granny Smith apple), is psychologically privileged. This level appears to be a compromise between informativeness and distinctiveness. The article ends with a consideration of the role of concepts in making inferences.
