Some scholars hold (or held up to early 2008, before young adults galvanized in support of Barack Obama's candidacy) that there is a pervasive, and perhaps even unprecedented, culture of political apathy among young adults in the U.S. (e.g., <a href="#b9" rel="references:#b9" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Bauerlein 2009</a>; <a href="#b30" rel="references:#b30" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Mindich 2005</a>). Others claim that the digital generation is pioneering the future of real participatory democracy (e.g., <a href="#b6" rel="references:#b6" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Barnard and Campbell 2003</a>; <a href="#b31" rel="references:#b31" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Mossberger 2007</a>). Most likely, the truth is somewhere at both of these poles, as well as in between them, and completely elsewhere. Developing barometers for measuring engagement quantitatively and then comparing it across generations is a complex task, equally as challenging as trying to tackle the qualitative side of this problem.</p></div><div class="para"><p>I argue here that the core issue is not one of weighing in on engagement versus disengagement writ large, but attempting to track the microprocesses through which people feel (or seem to be) connected with news stories, current events, and issues, and what might be called a wider national public sphere. Along these lines, my own work aims to answer: What does engagement or disengagement look like in young peoples' lives? What does it feel like? How do they describe it? And how do their various forms of talk indicate, or even construct, their (dis)engagements with different arenas of public life? In this article I focus on the discourse of young adults such as Alicia who express disconnection from and critique of mainstream television newscasting.</p></div><div class="para"><p>In examining the conditions of the possibility for this discourse and its implications, my central concerns are twofold: (1) to examine how this discourse draws upon and activates certain language and media ideologies and (2) to highlight the implications of this kind of analysis for an anthropology of public spheres. Crucially, the ideologies&mdash;or more precisely, the evaluative frames, expectations, and assumptions&mdash;at play in young people's talk about news media do not come out of thin air, rather, they play off and are entangled with the semiotics of newscasting's participation frames, other dimensions of news media production, and more general mainstream American cultural values about newscasting, ideal communication, and citizenship. They are also tied up with a particular moment in U.S. history which commentators have characterized as the rise of &ldquo;digital natives&rdquo; and the end of &ldquo;conventional journalism&rdquo; (<a href="#b28" rel="references:#b28" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">McChesney and Nichols 2010</a>; <a href="#b32" rel="references:#b32" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Palfrey and Gasser 2008</a>). This period is evidenced by an increased role of both social media and the Internet in young adults' news consumption patterns (<a href="#b34" rel="references:#b34" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Pew 2008</a>), as well as by a heightened solicitation by news media outlets of viewer contributed content and new forms of audience participation (<a href="#b29" rel="references:#b29" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">McKinney and Rill 2009</a>).</p></div><div class="para"><p>It is in this historical context that remarks like Alicia's &ldquo;And shouldn't we be focusing on what is happening?&rdquo; can be seen as foreshadowing and echoing iReport's solicitation (quoted above) for &ldquo;people [to] take part in the news with CNN.&rdquo; In this millennial and Web 2.0 moment&mdash;and possibly a new moment in public sphere articulation (<a href="#b42" rel="references:#b42" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Warner 2002</a>)&mdash;such statements bring to the fore questions such as, Who is the &ldquo;we&rdquo; that is producing news and that is consuming news? Who is &ldquo;the public&rdquo; that is normatively held to be responsible for understanding and being responsive to &ldquo;matters of common concern&rdquo; (<a href="#b13" rel="references:#b13" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Couldry et&nbsp;al. 2007</a>)? And how do different social actors at the levels of media production and media reception create expectations for and render judgments about these &ldquo;whos&rdquo;? A critical anthropology that examines the semiotic processes involved in contemporary forms of mediation is essential for this line of analysis. I suggest below that even as these relations shift (or, come under increased scrutiny) in the Web 2.0 context, there is still significant continuity in the semiotics of news genres' participation frameworks as well as the media and language ideologies that are engaged by both news producers and news consumers, despite the pervasive perception of newness and radical difference.</p></div><div class="para"><p>The material discussed here, while limited to a subset of discursive practices, illustrates how the story of millennial encounters with mainstream television newscasting is more than a story of remediation (<a href="#b11" rel="references:#b11" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Bolter and Grusin 1999</a>), understood as a bidirectional processes of old media informing new media and vice versa. The remediation concept is potentially misguiding as it tends to frame the issue as primarily about relations between media, as if media are actors independent of people, rather than about the interpretive work of social actors who use and produce media. Recasting remediation along the lines suggested by Gershon (this volume), remediation relations are fundamentally about the continuities and frictions of certain media and language ideologies as they are engaged by social actors who are evaluating, using, and producing a range of media and communication modalities within their complexly media-saturated and mediated lives.</p></div><div class="para"><p>To explore these relations, my analysis tacks back and forth across different dimensions of media reception, media textuality, and media production, as well as media history and sociocultural context. While the production-text-reception dimensions of mediated communication are often separated in the communication and media studies literature, I make a case here for their deep and necessary interconnections. Production, textuality, and reception are tied together by commonly circulating and mutually informing media and language ideologies, as well as by wider culturally-specific and historically-specific conditions and modes of being-in-the-world (see <a href="#b1" rel="references:#b1" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Abu-Lughod 2005</a>; <a href="#b17" rel="references:#b17" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ginsburg et&nbsp;al. 2002</a>; <a href="#b39" rel="references:#b39" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Spitulnik 1993</a>). As several scholars have argued in quite different ways, this point extends more broadly to the anthropology of mediation, as well as to media anthropology and the ethnography of communication (e.g., <a href="#b3" rel="references:#b3" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Agha 2007</a>; <a href="#b37" rel="references:#b37" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Silverstein 1993</a>; <a href="#b39" rel="references:#b39" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Spitulnik 1993</a>). Looking forward, such work also suggests that this is where an anthropology of public spheres is headed, simultaneously aiming to explain microprocesses of mediation, including the discursive practices in and around moments of media production and consumption, as well as the broader historical and cultural contexts that render these processes meaningful, and even possible.</p></div><div class="para"><p>The discussion which follows is organized into five sections. In the first, I provide an overview of my media reception research with young adults, emphasizing how their wide-ranging news media consumption practices complicate stereotyped notions of engagement and apathy. Following this, I move outward from this data to interrogate the theorization of public sphere engagement and explore possibilities for cataloguing different types of (dis)engagement stances and their rationalizations. The third section introduces the concept of generic personhood as a key operator in processes of public connection and examines the encoding of generic personhood of the interested viewer within the semiotics of mainstream television newscasting. The fourth section tracks the presence of these ideologies of news media consumption and production within young adults' discourses of critique and (dis)engagement. And finally, before concluding, a final section explores possible shifts in mainstream news media ideologies and the projected personhood of the interested viewer with the increased use of Web 2.0 platforms by conventional news outlets and in light of young adults' disaffections.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="ss2"><div class="headingCont"><h3>Conversations with Young Adults: Complications of Stereotyped Engagement and &ldquo;Apathy&rdquo;</h3></div><ol class="jumpList"><li><a href="#leftBorder" shape="rect">Top of page</a></li><li><a href="#abstract" shape="rect">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#ss2" shape="rect">Conversations with Young Adults: Complications of Stereotyped Engagement and &ldquo;Apathy&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href="#ss3" shape="rect">Points of Engagement</a></li><li><a href="#ss4" shape="rect">Generic Personhood and the Semiotics of Audience Construction and Involvement</a></li><li><a href="#ss5" shape="rect">Young People's Disaffections with Mainstream News Media</a></li><li><a href="#ss6" shape="rect">CNN Television News Media Ideologies in a Web 2.0 Environment</a></li><li><a href="#ss7" shape="rect">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#ss9" shape="rect">References</a></li></ol><div class="para"><p>The media reception material discussed here stems from research conducted between 2006 and 2008 among young adults (ages 18&ndash;25) from all walks of life in Atlanta. In late 2006 and early 2007, my research team constructed and audio recorded 15 different peer group conversations with 51 young people at Emory University about their news media consumption habits and their views about media's relation to politics in general.<a href="#en1" rel="references:#en1" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>1</sup></a> Then in mid-2007 and through late 2008, the study expanded to individual interviews with many of these same Emory students as well as other non-Emory young adults living in the wider Atlanta area who had either never attended college or who were at other colleges and universities in the region.<a href="#en2" rel="references:#en2" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>2</sup></a> In total, 78 individuals in the Atlanta area have been audiorecorded in interviews and in peer group conversations, producing over 60 hours of recorded material. Recruitment was nonrandom. We used convenience sampling and snowball sampling, relying mainly on the social networks and social settings of four different research assistants and those of their peers. I also used convenience sampling with my social networks and in public places around the city. In selection and recruitment an attempt was made to balance and diversify the study population along the lines of gender, class, race, age, educational level, political orientation, and levels of news media consumption. That being said, the discussion presented here does not aim for sweeping generalizations about &ldquo;young adults in Atlanta,&rdquo; nor it is pitched at making claims about the Emory University student body. The analysis focuses on a theme that runs through some, but not all of the data: young people's apparent disengagements from the genre of mainstream news broadcasting.</p></div><div class="para"><p>In the larger study, people's orientations to media, news, and politics ranged across the spectrum from compulsive news junkies to profoundly apathetic tuned-out individuals, from card-carrying bleeding heart liberals to Bible belt conservatives. At the time, Facebook, reality shows, iPods, cell phones, and <em>The Daily Show</em> figured prominently in most people's regular media consumption routines, particularly those of the college students. In line with what has been reported for this age group nationally (<a href="#b5" rel="references:#b5" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Annenberg Public Policy Center 2004</a>; <a href="#b34" rel="references:#b34" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Pew 2008</a>), a considerable number of those who were frequent news consumers used the Internet and especially video on demand, not television or conventional print media, as their primary news sources. Few listened to radio, and even fewer read hardcopy newspapers.<a href="#en3" rel="references:#en3" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>3</sup></a> Importantly, many of the frequent Internet news consumers gravitated toward news stories sent to them by their friends via social media such as Facebook or e-mail (cf. <a href="#b12" rel="references:#b12" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Boyd 2008</a>). Thus their news consumption was primarily what I would call selective, episodic, and often referral driven, rather than broad, routine and outlet driven. I return to this crucial fact in a later section, as it significantly informs young people's discourses of disaffection from mainstream television news media in subtle ways.</p></div><div class="para"><p>A tiny minority regularly used mainstream Internet news outlets (e.g., CNN, BBC) more systematically to read the day's stories and follow &ldquo;the news&rdquo; in a manner analogous to the classical ideal of reading through a daily print newspaper. A small number could be considered on the other side of the digital divide, with minimal to no cell phone and Internet usage, due primarily to economic reasons and in one case due to deliberate parental control. Most of the study was conducted before Twitter took off, and when news blogging was not yet popular among this age group.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Significantly, many young people in the study like Alicia were cynical about both the excesses and voids of mainstream television news. Some were aware of the contradictions between their critiques of mainstream media and their habitual consumption of it regardless. Strikingly, many expressed, as Alicia does in the opening quote above, what could be seen as a Baudrillardian critique about mainstream television news spectacles, simulations, and overload, while simultaneously invoking almost Habermasian normative frames about the importance of clear communication and ideal citizenship (<a href="#b8" rel="references:#b8" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baudrillard 1980</a>; <a href="#b20" rel="references:#b20" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Habermas 1989</a>). Taken together the two stances&mdash;through Alicia, not the theorists&mdash;are not necessarily incompatible. In some ways they read like Habermas' laments (or those of other mass culture theorists) about how marketing and publicity have taken over the public sphere (<a href="#b2" rel="references:#b2" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Adorno and Horkheimer 1972</a>).</p></div><div class="para"><p>Such commentary presents serious complications for received notions of engagement, disengagement, apathy, and the absence of agency as they pertain to young media users. For example, contrary to popular characterizations that tend to flatten the young disaffected as &ldquo;apathetic&rdquo; and &ldquo;unaware,&rdquo; I found that young people who are disaffected with mainstream news media are not necessarily disengaged or apathetic. Rather, as I explain in the following sections, their disaffection&mdash;as it filters through their talk about media&mdash;is highly charged and complexly layered. As <a href="#b15" rel="references:#b15" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Nina Eliasoph (1998</a>) has so forcefully argued in her ethnography of political (in)action among older adults, &ldquo;apathy&rdquo; is rarely a straightforward lack of engagement or shutting down: it is actively produced. Further, is it better understood as a form of engagement, in the sense that people develop elaborate practices, routines, and rationales around the fact that they are not engaged according to normative standards.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="ss3"><div class="headingCont"><h3>Points of Engagement</h3></div><ol class="jumpList"><li><a href="#leftBorder" shape="rect">Top of page</a></li><li><a href="#abstract" shape="rect">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#ss2" shape="rect">Conversations with Young Adults: Complications of Stereotyped Engagement and &ldquo;Apathy&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href="#ss3" shape="rect">Points of Engagement</a></li><li><a href="#ss4" shape="rect">Generic Personhood and the Semiotics of Audience Construction and Involvement</a></li><li><a href="#ss5" shape="rect">Young People's Disaffections with Mainstream News Media</a></li><li><a href="#ss6" shape="rect">CNN Television News Media Ideologies in a Web 2.0 Environment</a></li><li><a href="#ss7" shape="rect">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#ss9" shape="rect">References</a></li></ol><div class="para"><p>The need for such nuances points to a broader theoretical problem, one which is just beginning to rear its head in the wake of recent critiques and elaborations of the Habermasian concept of the public sphere. Put simply, the problem is: Just what does it mean to be engaged in the (or a) public sphere? How do we document and theorize from a person-centered, phenomenological perspective what it means to connect with the (or a) public sphere? And how does the theorization of bottom-up forms of connection relate to the theorization of institution-based or circulation-based public sphere formation and functioning? These are weighty questions, currently skirting around the edges of recent research and not yet being asked or answered with much rigor. They weigh on me as I work through my material, and force me, for the time being, to use the terms <em>engagement</em> and <em>disengagement</em> in very qualified ways, and certainly not as analytical primes.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Important breakthroughs in scholarship include the casting of engagement in terms of forms of &ldquo;public connection&rdquo; that are not necessarily stable or consistent, but instead episodic or phased (<a href="#b13" rel="references:#b13" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Couldry et&nbsp;al. 2007</a>). The current vocabulary in the media studies and social survey research for labeling these various stances, however, is itself fairly uncritical and underspecified; it often imports cultural assumptions and levels important nuances. An ontology of measurement (e.g., scale and degree) is often tacitly, if not explicitly, present. In my own work, <em>disengagement</em> ends up being a cover term for a wide range of stances. The expression of these &ldquo;disengaged&rdquo; stances manifests as everything from affectless habitual indifference or laughter-infused confession to very angry or cynical refusal. Degree is sometimes helpful in comparing these different stances, but not completely. Let's consider some of them below.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Consistent with the findings of <a href="#b15" rel="references:#b15" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Eliasoph (1998</a>) for older adults in the U.S., stances of true apathy are rare and hard to maintain. Apathy is actively produced and complexly rationalized. I found that typically those who self-label along these lines are also people who describe themselves as lazy and indifferent. They say they do not care and that it is too much work to be informed. Take for example college sophomore Michelle (group 212)<a href="#en4" rel="references:#en4" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>4</sup></a> who, unprompted, affirms a classic generational indictment: &ldquo;[W]e are so lazy, like we're only gonna know something if it's like in our face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;So if we have to work to find stuff out, it's gonna be even less likely that we're gonna be politically active and like know what's going on.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="para"><p>Such seemingly pure indifference can be contrasted with a second type of stance found among those who sometimes worry about their indifference. They might have some active news-seeking practices, but this is coupled with a nagging social conscience that they should care more. Witness Amy (group 131): &ldquo;Occasionally there will be a story I read in the news and like &lsquo;Oh God, this is something.&rsquo; Like some cause is annoying. Or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&lsquo;The government, you know, is pissing me off. I should like really, really do something about it&rsquo;. But I never actually do.&rdquo; Unlike Michelle who bundles her lack of connection with a generic generational &ldquo;we,&rdquo; Amy uses a very personal and split consciousness &ldquo;I&rdquo; to explain her disconnect. Through direct speech that represents her internal thought processes, Amy voices temporary moments of connection and concern. There are &ldquo;causes,&rdquo;&ldquo;the government&rdquo; and feelings of being pissed off or annoyed. While one &ldquo;I&rdquo; self-evaluates against a normative standard of &ldquo;do[ing] something,&rdquo; the other glibly self-reports about inaction.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Both Michelle's and Amy's remarks revolve around a media ideology that news media outlets deliver something that people should know about (&ldquo;what's going on&rdquo;), care about, and act on. This theme also appears in a third stance, one of passive engagement or &ldquo;happenstance consumption.&rdquo; This characterizes those who do seem interested in news and current events, but who do not actively seek it out on a regular basis. In the words of Rachel (group 142), an 18-year-old college student, &ldquo;It's like when a lot of people are talking about something, I don't feel the need to read it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if I just come out of a situation where everyone's talking about one issue, I'm not gonna like go seek out more information on it, &lsquo;cause I feel like I've covered it.&rdquo; A fourth type of stance, one that appears frequently in the U.K. research (<a href="#b13" rel="references:#b13" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Couldry et&nbsp;al. 2007</a>), involves rationalizing limited news consumption in terms of not having enough time or having other priorities. This is a compartmentalization of involvement, or what might be called a pragmatically rationalized disengagement. And finally, a fifth kind of stance emerges with those who describe their disenchantments and disengagements in emotionally charged terms. Like Alicia, they blame news outlets for bias, story overkill, manipulative framing, and misplaced priorities. As discussed more fully in a later section, they explain themselves as angry and frustrated, or emotionally exhausted. For many, it appears that their news filtering and avoidance is experienced as a strategy that makes their moral and emotional worlds manageable.</p></div><div class="para"><p>While this quick catalog of &ldquo;types&rdquo; of stances provides a snapshot of a range of expressions of disaffection, disconnection, streamlined consumption, and avoidance, there are other ways to approach and even catalog the data. Themes of work and effort, for example, figure prominently in many remarks. Michelle (&ldquo;So if we have to work to find stuff out&rdquo;), Rachel (&ldquo;I'm not gonna like go seek out more information on it, &lsquo;cause I feel like I've covered it&rdquo;), and many others who simply say they have better things to do than keep up with the news, rationalize their media use (or nonuse) in terms of an economy of mental labor and personal time allocation. None of these rationalizations or reactions occurs in a vacuum. One area of particular concern to me is how mainstream news media broadcasts themselves set up points and ideologies of possible engagement, including ideas about what kind of &ldquo;work&rdquo; the viewer is supposed to do. The next section turns to this topic directly, particularly as it relates to concepts of the person. Following this I return to a closer look at discourses of disaffection.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="ss4"><div class="headingCont"><h3>Generic Personhood and the Semiotics of Audience Construction and Involvement</h3></div><ol class="jumpList"><li><a href="#leftBorder" shape="rect">Top of page</a></li><li><a href="#abstract" shape="rect">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#ss2" shape="rect">Conversations with Young Adults: Complications of Stereotyped Engagement and &ldquo;Apathy&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href="#ss3" shape="rect">Points of Engagement</a></li><li><a href="#ss4" shape="rect">Generic Personhood and the Semiotics of Audience Construction and Involvement</a></li><li><a href="#ss5" shape="rect">Young People's Disaffections with Mainstream News Media</a></li><li><a href="#ss6" shape="rect">CNN Television News Media Ideologies in a Web 2.0 Environment</a></li><li><a href="#ss7" shape="rect">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#ss9" shape="rect">References</a></li></ol><div class="para"><p>Media as texts, encountered by media users and created by media producers, have numerous points at which there are projected preferred readings, and projected points of possible engagement (cf. <a href="#b21" rel="references:#b21" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Hall 1973</a>). Importantly, many of these involve the semiotic construction of what could be termed &ldquo;the generic addressee&rdquo; or &ldquo;the generic person.&rdquo; This is the case in both pre- and post-Web 2.0 formats.<a href="#en5" rel="references:#en5" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>5</sup></a> I propose that for the television newscast genre, these processes collectively build up I call the &ldquo;generic personhood of the interested viewer,&rdquo; a type of personhood that rests on an intertwined set of media and language ideologies. These ideologies are linked to the culturally-specific meanings of news journalism in the U.S., the participation frameworks of the broadcast news genre, and very specific American ideologies of true and faithful communication. More on these shortly.</p></div><div class="para"><p>As indicated in some of the data considered above, many young American adults' (dis)engagements with mainstream news media are tangled up with an unspoken acceptance of the normativity of interest and attention when it comes to mainstream news media consumption. The attentive audience hailed by mainstream news media is often taken seriously, and becomes a measure of self &ldquo;normalness&rdquo; or &ldquo;deviance&rdquo; vis-&agrave;-vis media consumption and citizenship. With these media and language ideologies, there are projected &ldquo;preferred readings&rdquo; for how one is to place oneself as a receiver of the mass media news genre.</p></div><div class="para"><p>So how does the semiotics of audience address and reference in news and current affairs broadcasting work? It is complex and multilayered. It goes far beyond issues of pronouns, but we can begin there. Various &ldquo;we,&rdquo;&ldquo;we-you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;you&rdquo; constructions in newscasting produce a generic idea of the listening or viewing audience as everyone-but-no-one-in-particular (<a href="#b35" rel="references:#b35 #b36" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citations" shape="rect">Scannell 1996, 2000</a>; <a href="#b40" rel="references:#b40" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Tolson 2006</a>). A wide range of expressions do this. For example, imperatives such as &ldquo;stay tuned for more on that story&rdquo; urge a generic &ldquo;you&rdquo; to remain attentive. And further, they implicitly promise this generic &ldquo;you&rdquo; that valuable communication is forthcoming. As is well known from the work of <a href="#b4" rel="references:#b4" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ang (1991</a>), genericness and &ldquo;taxonomic collectives&rdquo; are at the heart of broadcasting media ideologies and practices.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Statements such as &ldquo;This is CNN. We're so glad you're here with us today,&rdquo; still remain at the level of the generic &ldquo;you,&rdquo; but they personalize the communication with the expression of warm affect and various deictic expressions that structure a dyadic &ldquo;we-you&rdquo; co-presence. Other modes of producing a generic idea of the listening or viewing audience as everyone-but-no-one-in-particular can be found in the participation frameworks set up via the relay of anchor-correspondent communications, such as this: [Anchor to correspondent]&ldquo;Jim, can you tell us what you've seen today on the steps of Capitol Hill?&rdquo; Here, anchor and correspondent collude, to place the anchor and the viewer on the same side, a &ldquo;we&rdquo; who is learning something from a &ldquo;you,&rdquo; their interlocutor placed on location (cf. <a href="#b18" rel="references:#b18" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Goffman 1981</a>).</p></div><div class="para"><p>Analogous structures play out in anchor-commentator participation frameworks, for example when an anchor says in closing to a commentator: &ldquo;Thank you so much for your insights, we really appreciate it.&rdquo; With this &ldquo;we&rdquo; she places viewers on the same side with her: They will continue in a communication event together, while taking leave of the guest who just popped in for a few comments. Not only are they placed together in the same deictic frame, the anchor and viewer apparently share the same feelings: &ldquo;really appreciating&rdquo; the contributions of the person who just talked with them. In these complex participation frameworks, viewers are seamlessly shifted from being bystanders or witnesses in what <a href="#b24" rel="references:#b24" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Irvine (1996</a>) would call &ldquo;shadow conversations&rdquo; as they watch anchor-commentator exchanges, to being close partners aligned with the anchor who continues the program.</p></div><div class="para"><p>In the literature on these processes, much emphasis is placed on the indexical functions of pronouns or collective noun forms, and the genre structures themselves. For example, in the work on public construction, <a href="#b42" rel="references:#b42" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Warner</a> proposes that such kinds of linguistic projections construct an &ldquo;imaginary reference point of the public&rdquo; (2002). <a href="#b26" rel="references:#b26 #b27" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citations" shape="rect">Lee (1998, 2001</a>) argues that in many cases it is a matter of &ldquo;performing the people,&rdquo; for example, a creative act of self-reference which authoritatively states the existence of a &ldquo;we.&rdquo; Crucially, this act must occur in a legitimate linguistic variety and in a legitimate genre, for it to have any power. Thus, public construction depends on certain &ldquo;forms of sociolinguistically created authority,&rdquo; according to <a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Gal and Woolard (2001</a>:5). For it to have an effect, any utterance of <em>we</em>&mdash;or any other mode of address denoting a general collectivity, for that matter&mdash;needs to occur within a type of speech event, from a type of speaker, and in a linguistic variety, all of which are valorized as the most appropriate for naming such collectivities.</p></div><div class="para"><p>In addition to all this, I propose that in the case of U.S. news and current affairs broadcasting&mdash;and perhaps also in most other forms of authoritative/mainstream public discourse in the U.S.&mdash;audience construction and public construction also hinge on two things: (1) the creation of the listener/viewer as a particular kind of experiencing subject and (2) the creation of a normative model of sincere and felicitious communication. One might say that this is a place where Gricean (<a href="#b19" rel="references:#b19" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Grice 1975</a>) maxims seem to reign supreme, with the following normative ideologies:</p></div><div class="para"><blockquote class="quote"><div class="para"><p>Everything that is said is relevant.</p></div><div class="para"><p>No one lies.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Speakers are clear. And they say no more than is necessary.</p></div><div class="para"><p>People are attentive.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Uptake is assumed and expected.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Attention does not wane.</p></div><div class="para"><p>The communication works out well for all concerned.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="para"><p>Applying ethnomethodology to the tube, the significance of the discourse that is there can be thrown into bold relief by contrasting it with the discourse that is not there. For example, imagine the anchor who says: &ldquo;You might be about to change the channel, but I've been told by my bosses that I need to promise you it will be worth your time to watch what we've got next.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Maybe you didn't understand what I just said, so I'll repeat it and give a bit more context to the story as well.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;This next story is particularly for Rose Sinclair in Cleveland, but the rest of you can watch it too.&rdquo; These things do not happen because expectations of generic attention, interest, and relevance are all there and need to be relatively unsaid.</p></div><div class="para"><p>So within the discursive flow of mainstream broadcast news, the experiencing subjectivity of the listener or viewer is taken as an unproblematic part of this media and communication ideology frame: everyone is on board in a genuine way, everyone is well intentioned and cooperative. The anchor can act as spokesperson for shared feelings of appreciation, concern, and interest. It is all genuine and moving along quite smoothly (cf. Kunreuther, this volume). The generically addressed person is the good citizen-news consumer, interested, always ready and available to tune in, always able to understand and process.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Of course we know this is not the case&mdash;media communication is a vast land of uncertainty where individuals might be invited to be genuine interested addressees, but there is no guarantee that they will take it on. As is well known from the work of <a href="#b18" rel="references:#b18" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Goffman (1981</a>), <a href="#b22" rel="references:#b22" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Hall (1996</a>), and others, recruitment to subject position&mdash;what has been termed &ldquo;interpellation&rdquo; or &ldquo;hailing&rdquo; is tricky business. This is precisely where many young viewers do not get on board so to speak, and where they are allegedly &ldquo;disengaged&rdquo; or &ldquo;apathetic.&rdquo; In reality, this is rarely an absolute tuning out. In most cases it is better understood as a refusal (e.g., of the excess or void in mainstream news media) or a compartmentalization of involvement (e.g., a pragmatically measured and timed engagement). Regardless, however, the concept of generic personhood, complete with ideologies of attentiveness and responsibility, is a key operator in processes of public connection as it shapes both preferred and discordant readings.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="ss5"><div class="headingCont"><h3>Young People's Disaffections with Mainstream News Media</h3></div><ol class="jumpList"><li><a href="#leftBorder" shape="rect">Top of page</a></li><li><a href="#abstract" shape="rect">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#ss2" shape="rect">Conversations with Young Adults: Complications of Stereotyped Engagement and &ldquo;Apathy&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href="#ss3" shape="rect">Points of Engagement</a></li><li><a href="#ss4" shape="rect">Generic Personhood and the Semiotics of Audience Construction and Involvement</a></li><li><a href="#ss5" shape="rect">Young People's Disaffections with Mainstream News Media</a></li><li><a href="#ss6" shape="rect">CNN Television News Media Ideologies in a Web 2.0 Environment</a></li><li><a href="#ss7" shape="rect">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#ss9" shape="rect">References</a></li></ol><div class="para"><p>Returning then to the discourses of young adults as they talk about their disaffections with mainstream news media, how does this talk draw upon and activate certain themes and ideologies of the generic interested viewer? Some speak of pure apathy, as does Roxanne (group 221): &ldquo;Well I mean some issues&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that, like they're talking about in the news and I'm like, &lsquo;Wow, I don't ((laughter)) care about that&rsquo;.&rdquo; This seems to be a frontal rejection of the generic interested viewer. Laughter, however, plays a significant role here and in similar types of utterances, as a form of double-voicing or parallel commentary. While upfront Roxanne asserts disinterest with word choice (&ldquo;I don't care about that&rdquo;), the parallel channel of laughter indicates a sense of unease or irony, an evaluation that draws upon the ideology of normative interest which is the exact opposite of her upfront assertion.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Other young adults focus on the recruitment frame itself, particularly its sensationalist nature, as in Alicia's revoicing of media hype during a four-person peer group conversation (group 231):</p></div><div class="para"><blockquote class="quote"><div class="para"><p><em>Alicia</em>: What actually I don't like about that is how when the news people when they get their new story is they get all excited about it and they are like &ldquo;WE HAVE THE STORY FIRST, WE HAVE THE STORY FIRST. COME WATCH US. WE ARE BETTER THAN THE OTHER NEWS PEOPLE.&rdquo; And shouldn't we be focusing on what is happening?</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>Jackie</em>: Yeah.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>A</em>: But they are like &ldquo;NO, WE GOT THE STORY.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>All</em>: ((Laughter))</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>A</em>: It drives me insane.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>J</em>: They are all vicious in a way.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>A</em>: They are. Like their their whole thing is &ldquo;COME WATCH US, WE GOT THE STORY.&rdquo; And they spend all five seconds being like, &ldquo;Oh these people died, BUT BY THE WAY, WE GOT THE STORY. WE ARE BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONES.&rdquo;</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="para"><p>Here, the recruitment to attentive audience position and the alignment with the emotional stance performed by the announcer is rejected or mocked, along with a critique of corporate branding and the apparent priorities of the communication itself. As the conversation unfolds (with a rich amount of co-constructing), Alicia's revoicing of announcer hype is used as a counterpoint for self: As if to say &ldquo;I see through it. I won't fall for that sensationalism and manipulation.&rdquo; Or, in Alicia's own words, &ldquo;It drives me insane.&rdquo; Alicia develops her stance&mdash;and the drama of egregious media hype and competitive corporate branding&mdash;through a sequence of loud media quotes and repetitions, as well as through a sarcastic counterpoint: &ldquo;And they spend all five seconds being like, &lsquo;Oh these people died&rsquo;.&rdquo; Unlike Roxanne, Alicia does not overtly reject the ideology of the generic interested viewer. She upholds the ideologies of journalistic and listener responsibility and wishes to see the news void filled with more news coverage, and less hyped up framing about breaking a news story first: &ldquo;And shouldn't we be focusing on what is happening?&rdquo;</p></div><div class="para"><p>Still, one might read Alicia's and Jackie's talk as a subtle and perhaps not fully articulated commentary about realigning the locus of news media responsibility and production away from corporate control and toward a wider public commons.<a href="#en6" rel="references:#en6" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>6</sup></a> Thus, not only is there the direct critique of corporate branding (Jackie's &ldquo;they are all vicious in a way&rdquo; and Alicia's loudly repeated &ldquo;WE ARE BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONES&rdquo;), subtle pronoun shifts across this interaction indicate a possible alternative configuration of actors within the news media landscape. This is worth unpacking in detail.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Typically, counterpoint to self is a key rhetorical trope in young people's discourses of disaffection. Tropes of self versus other, expressed as &ldquo;I&rdquo; (and sometimes &ldquo;we&rdquo;) versus &ldquo;they&rdquo; and &ldquo;the media&rdquo; figure prominently in the discourse of Roxanne above, Amy's in an earlier section, and several others' in the examples below. In the passage above, Alicia activates these counterpoints and the received alignment of the relevant actors (the &ldquo;who's&rdquo;) within the public sphere. She starts with the common configuration of &ldquo;I&rdquo; versus &ldquo;they&rdquo; (&ldquo;the news people&rdquo;), and then voices this latter group as one that speaks as a &ldquo;we&rdquo; (&ldquo;WE HAVE THE STORY FIRST&rdquo;). This &ldquo;we&rdquo; does not include her. Alicia then seems to realign the entire relation by invoking a different &ldquo;we,&rdquo; one that does include her, and one that &ldquo;focus[es] on what is happening.&rdquo; Her words leave ambiguous just who this &ldquo;who&rdquo; is within the public sphere: Is it those on the &ldquo;us&rdquo; (vs. them) divide of Alicia et&nbsp;al. versus corporate media, or does it denote a new &ldquo;we,&rdquo; one that fuses this dichotomy?</p></div><div class="para"><p>Continuing with other critiques of media hype and story overkill, let us consider the exchange below between three first year students as they discuss CNN (group 111). Again, there is extensive discursive co-construction. Exhibiting a common pattern in talk about media excess, experiences of media overproduction and overconsumption are framed in terms of food and eating metaphors (&ldquo;eat it to death&rdquo;).</p></div><div class="para"><blockquote class="quote"><div class="para"><p><em>David</em>: Well when you watch like CNN, I mean it does get a little redundant, I'd have to say-</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>Ken</em>: Yeah, I mean like 24-hour news, they are making up news like at that point.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>Susan</em>: Yeah, shark attacks. [referring to her earlier example of hyped media stories]</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>K</em>: Or like, like &ldquo;A man raises huge rabbits to beat North Korea&rdquo; kind of thing. Eh-heh.</p></div><div class="para"><p>S: Eh-heh yeah, yeah I agree.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>D</em>: I mean I just feel like they'll take like one story and they're gonna just, oh man-</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>K</em>: Eat it to death.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>D</em>: Yeah, they will just eat it to death. They will cover every issue of it. And sometimes it's not always that important of a story to like general America, but they try and make it important&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[L]ike something that you would think would be just mentioned once, they make like a week long segment and then they dissect it from everybody's like angle.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="para"><p>Significantly while David, Ken, and Susan elaborate on CNN's rampant violations of Gricean maxims of quantity (&ldquo;eat it to death&rdquo;) and relevance (&ldquo;huge rabbits&rdquo;), they implicitly align themselves with &ldquo;general America,&rdquo; a generic audience who should be receiving a more felicitous form of communication. The ideal media-language ideology is one of rational, responsible, relevant, and true information, but they see this as disrupted by the irrationality of a 24-hour news cycle and sensationalist headlining. It is as if media producer and media consumer alike are victims of this voracious news cycle, with little or no attribution of alternative forms of responsibility akin to what Alicia explicitly asks for, and Jackie implicitly implies with the charge of &ldquo;vicious[ness].&rdquo;</p></div><div class="para"><p>A fourth type of response does not fault the communication priorities or the hyped up framing, rather it focuses on the fact that the felicitous communication does not work at the level of affective resonance. Put simply, an undue emotional burden is placed on the listener. Thus in the example below college junior Vanessa (group 231) who participated in the same conversation group as Alicia and Jackie, describes how there is &ldquo;so much coming at you at one time&rdquo;:</p></div><div class="para"><blockquote class="quote"><div class="para"><p><em>Vanessa</em>: um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I guess just because I think- this is gonna sound so na&iuml;ve and so um immature, but when I watch the real&mdash;ha&mdash;the real news, I guess in quotes. Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it seems like it's all so much coming at you at one time. And it's never anything good, it's always so heavy and so- I leave not feeling empowered, but feeling just like-</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>Kelly</em>: Depressed.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="para"><p>While divulging her own desire to disconnect, Vanessa prefaces these remarks with an auto-critique expressing normative expectations, and a perceived failure to live up them. Lingering behind the self-critique (&ldquo;this is gonna sound so na&iuml;ve and so um immature&rdquo;) is an ideology of the responsible citizen-news consumer, one who is always interested and always able to understand and process. Significantly, at the same time that she expresses a self-critique using this trope of normative viewership, Vanessa suggests, like her friend Alicia, that mainstream news media outlets do not live up to normative production expectations. Rather they manufacture an illusion of &ldquo;real news.&rdquo; Discursively this critique happens with minimalistic or forced laughter (&ldquo;ha&rdquo;) and a metalinguistic comment about placing her phrase &ldquo;real news&rdquo;&ldquo;in quotes.&rdquo; Though distinct in tenor from that of Roxanne above, Vanessa's laughter with the ironic quotes similarly signals a kind of split consciousness or double-layered assessment of the mediated connection process.</p></div><div class="para"><p>The question of whether they want &ldquo;real news&rdquo; or what &ldquo;real news&rdquo; without ironic quotes would look like remains unexplored. Vanessa's friend Kelly echoes the sentiment of being emotionally overwhelmed, as she too co-constructs the commentary, and finishes Vanessa's turn. The affective consequences of responsible citizenship and fully processing the news is too much to bear: &ldquo;it's always so heavy,&rdquo;&ldquo;I leave not feeling empowered,&rdquo;&ldquo;feeling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;depressed.&rdquo; It is unclear whether they perceive this to be the fault of the news producers, the news stories themselves, or their own &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; level. Vanessa and Kelly leave this ambiguous. Regardless, their commentary illustrates the exact opposite of disengagement: they argue for the emotional power of the news coverage and they state that they are <em>too</em> engaged by it.</p></div><div class="para"><p>For many, the alternatives to working to be informed (Michelle's &ldquo;hav[ing] to work to find stuff out&rdquo;) or to being too emotionally overburdened in &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; ways, is to be engaged in &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and light ways. Jon Stewart's <em>Daily Show</em> is one place where this can happen. For example, continuing with her trope of weight, Vanessa explains, &ldquo;I like <em>The Daily Show</em>, because it's ya know factual and it's true, but at the same time it's not like so heavy that you know your day is ruined from watching it.&rdquo; Like the &ldquo;ruin&rdquo;&ldquo;your day&rdquo; of Vanessa, the personal injury of &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; news is also expressed through metaphors of consumption and (in)digestion. In the words of James (group 141) a college senior, &ldquo;<em>The Daily Show</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;does tap, like hit on main issues that are going on, but it presents them in a light that's kinda fun to hear. Well, not fun to hear about them, but I mean it's, it's stomachable. Ya know it's not just sort of the doom and gloom kind of side of it.&rdquo; Notably, these comments contain normative evaluations that news should be serious, &ldquo;factual,&rdquo; important, and &ldquo;true,&rdquo; but that a freer range of modalities of engagement (including &ldquo;kinda fun&rdquo; ones) is preferable. James' careful midstream reframe about what he means by &ldquo;fun to hear&rdquo; highlights this division. For him, &ldquo;fun to hear&rdquo; pertains to modalities of reception, even though the news content itself can remain &ldquo;not fun.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="para"><p>While Vanessa disengages from conventional news coverage because she is overwhelmed by news stories and wants to minimize or make manageable its emotional impact on her life, other young adults talk about a different kind of charged disengagement where the content of the story and the quantity of the coverage are both overwhelming. So, for example, earlier in the same peer group conversation and before the material presented in the Alicia and Jackie exchange above, college junior Kelly describes her inability to keep up with the news on the Iraq war. Significantly, these remarks were made in October 2006, a time of peak story fatigue and war fatigue.</p></div><div class="para"><blockquote class="quote"><div class="para"><p><em>Kelly</em>: I'm so frustrated with what's going on over there [Iraq]. Well, I don't know, actually I don't know how I feel about it. But I don't even pay attention to it anymore. It's everyday, it's on everyday.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>Vanessa</em>: mhmmmm</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>K</em>: And I just can't follow it like that.</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>V</em>: And it seems like the more and more we get into it even though we have been over there I think I heard that like within a month, we will have been fighting this war as long as we were involved in WWII, which is crazy to think about to me, but like it seems like as much we talk about it we say the same thing over and over again..</p></div><div class="para"><p><em>K</em>: And whenever it comes on, I just, I don't pay attention.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="para"><p>Expressions of charged disengagement also focus directly on media bias. For example, Oliver (group 212) below rationalizes the fact he tunes out from time to time by saying that media are not as responsible as they should be. Again we see a blame-the-media stance like the ones expressed in most examples above. For Oliver, the media are not responsible, so why should he be?</p></div><div class="para"><blockquote class="quote"><div class="para"><p>I could get all the news I wanted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a part of it's my responsibility that I could find out whatever information's out there is available to me. But at the same time like, I think it's the responsibility of the source to try to give it to me as unbiased as possible. [Oliver, group 212]</p></div></blockquote></div><div class="para"><p>In contrast to people like Vanessa and Kelly, whose charged disengagement involves various strategies of emotional and moral world protection&mdash;that is, akin to saying &ldquo;DO NOT ENTER: stay away from my conscience and my feelings&rdquo;&mdash;people like Oliver project their standards outward, as if to say, &ldquo;I WON'T SHOW UP: you don't measure up; you don't have the same moral compass.&rdquo; In one fell swoop, Oliver makes explicit the same media-language ideology complex that undergirds the comments by Alicia, Jackie, Susan, David, and Ken. For all, the ideal news genre contains the ideologies of journalistic responsibility (&ldquo;the responsibility of the source&rdquo;), of asymmetric speaker-addressee relations (&ldquo;give it to me&rdquo;), and of truth and factuality (&ldquo;unbiased as possible&rdquo;).</p></div><div class="para"><p>Taking these different examples as a set of (partly developed) snapshots of the very complex relations that young adults have with the genre of television newscasting, we see that disengagement&mdash;or better, disaffection&mdash;from mainstream news media is rarely a lack of involvement. It is highly charged and complexly layered. Many young people fill in or recoil from the affectless generic personhood of the ideal responsible viewer with their own affect (&ldquo;depressed&rdquo;), sarcasm (&ldquo;COME WATCH US!&rdquo;), biting critique (&ldquo;they are all vicious&rdquo;), refusal (&ldquo;I don't even pay attention to it anymore&rdquo;), and anger. Simultaneously many still operate with the ideology (and dream) of a bias-free news media, and normatively measure themselves against an ideal of good citizenship. While much contemporary mainstream TV newscasting now aims to tell people like Alicia that their contributed content matters, that the named and quoted viewer is just as important as the generic viewer, and that asymmetric speaker-addressee relations are equally as important as multidirectional and alternating ones, it is now looking like people like Alicia are long gone as part of a stable &ldquo;desperately sought&rdquo; (<a href="#b4" rel="references:#b4" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ang 1991</a>) audience for this genre. At the same time, many continue to preserve some of its core attributes, precisely through their disengagement practices and discourses.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="ss6"><div class="headingCont"><h3>CNN Television News Media Ideologies in a Web 2.0 Environment</h3></div><ol class="jumpList"><li><a href="#leftBorder" shape="rect">Top of page</a></li><li><a href="#abstract" shape="rect">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#ss2" shape="rect">Conversations with Young Adults: Complications of Stereotyped Engagement and &ldquo;Apathy&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href="#ss3" shape="rect">Points of Engagement</a></li><li><a href="#ss4" shape="rect">Generic Personhood and the Semiotics of Audience Construction and Involvement</a></li><li><a href="#ss5" shape="rect">Young People's Disaffections with Mainstream News Media</a></li><li><a href="#ss6" shape="rect">CNN Television News Media Ideologies in a Web 2.0 Environment</a></li><li><a href="#ss7" shape="rect">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#ss9" shape="rect">References</a></li></ol><div class="para"><p>In mid-2007 and through 2008, not long after many of these conversations were recorded, mainstream news media outlets such as CNN began to integrate a variety of social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, blogs, e-mail) into regular newscasting formats. Many of these seem to herald a shift in mainstream news media ideologies and the projected personhood of the interested viewer. They are worth considering here briefly, in light of the discourses of disaffection discussed above. I focus just on CNN, both because it was a leader in this area and because I was able to speak with some Atlanta-based CNN producers outside of their workplace (under the agreement of confidentiality) through my personal networks in Atlanta. As the type of data and mode of analysis used in this section diverges somewhat from the previous sections, it might be viewed more as a sidebar or epigraph, in parallel and indirect relation to the story of mediated connections and discourses of disaffection above.</p></div><div class="para"><p>As the U.S. presidential election campaign heated up in mid-2007 and through 2008, the public face of CNN television news started to shift dramatically. Trying to catch up, in its own way, with the digital revolution and the explosion of social media platforms and genres, and trying to engage young viewers and head off the complete death of mainstream one-to-many broadcasting (anonymous producer), CNN introduced a number of participatory multimedia formats into its news and current events front end. In 2007, the network hosted the first CNN-YouTube presidential debates in which candidates fielded questions from groups interfacing with the event via YouTube feeds (<a href="#b29" rel="references:#b29" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">McKinney and Rill 2009</a>). Blogosphere segments and tweets were incorporated into CNN reporting in mid-2008, and in September 2008, CNN anchor Rick Sanchez, launched a new show (<em>Rick Sanchez Direct</em>) based on Twitter (<a href="#b14" rel="references:#b14" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Crum 2008</a>). In October 2008, CNN created <em>Facebook Connect</em> as a platform for posting comments on the presidential debates (<a href="#b38" rel="references:#b38" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Smith 2008</a>). As digital media moved into the CNN newsroom, CNN expanded into more and more digital media environments and platforms. For example, social media trend watcher <em>Mashable</em> stated in September 2008, &ldquo;CNN is one of the few broadcast networks with an expansive line of shining examples in the Web 2.0 space, from basic RSS and bookmarking options to embeddable videos, and its fully user generated content platform iReport.com&rdquo; (<a href="#b23" rel="references:#b23" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Hirsch 2008</a>). On January 20, 2009, CNN and Facebook teamed up for coverage of and participation in the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama (<a href="#b33" rel="references:#b33" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Perez 2009</a>). Facebook status updates were integrated as a constantly changing sidebar on CNN.com Live, so that viewers of live broadcast coverage on the web could also see a continuous flow of Facebook status updates of those watching.</p></div><div class="para"><p>During this period, CNN began to adopt more populist participatory formats in the studio as well, such as &ldquo;focus group&rdquo; and &ldquo;town hall&rdquo; formats. While the precedent for many of these participatory multi-media formats, CNN <em>Talk Back Live,</em> predates the entrance of Web 2.0 formats into mainstream journalism by nearly 15 years, this was a period of intense change and experimentation with media formats not just with one program, but on numerous newscasting fronts.<a href="#en7" rel="references:#en7" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>7</sup></a> Many of these changes were made not only because of newly available communication platforms, but also in response to declining ratings overall and hard evidence that young adults were increasingly moving toward online news sources (<a href="#b34" rel="references:#b34" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Pew 2008</a>; anonymous producer). While the back end (and much of the front end) retained the same mainstream ideologies and practices&mdash;speak to everyone in general and to no one in particular; cultivate viewers as intimate addressees (usually in the project of the nation); create captive viewers through titillation and promise; pronounce journalistic neutrality and perform journalistic authority while not offending sponsors; uphold (minimally left-of-center) status-quo oriented institutional purchase on truth, responsibility, and civic decency; if it bleeds it leads; and so on&mdash;the front end had visibly added a new media ideology, namely: viewer contributed content matters (cf. <a href="#b4" rel="references:#b4" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ang 1991</a>; <a href="#b25" rel="references:#b25" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Kerbel 2001</a>; <a href="#b36" rel="references:#b36" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Scannell 2000</a>).</p></div><div class="para"><p>CNN began to explicitly state in its own ads, slogans, and anchor exhortations, as well as in its very practices: You help make the news, you are the news, what you say matters, be part of us, we need your input, we want to hear and measure your opinions. And ultimately: We cannot communicate without your co-participation in acts of communication. CNN carried this campaign online, for example with iReport, which states on its front page: &ldquo;Welcome to iReport, where people take part in the news with CNN. Your voice, together with other iReporters, helps shape how and what CNN covers everyday. So you know: iReport is the way people like you report the news&rdquo; (<!--TODO: clickthrough URL--><a href="http://www.ireport.com" title="Link to external resource: http://www.ireport.com" shape="rect">http://www.ireport.com</a>).</p></div><div class="para"><p>A staple part of most CNN newscasts, there is now a near-constant stream of viewer-generated content (from e-mails, tweets, Facebook posts, instant messaging, and survey responses) that scrolls along the bottom of the screen, appears in side bars, and is projected and dissected by commentators during specific airtime segments. It is difficult, if not impossible to attribute these shifts to a single one-dimensional ideology. Rather, this ideological shift is better understood as a constellation of interconnected ideologies, defined by at least three axes: one about &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; participation, a second about a positively valued &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; and hipness attached to new media technologies and social networking platforms, and a third (more back end than front end) about viewer attention and engagement&mdash;and thus ratings and advertising dollars&mdash;being more safely secured via media interactivity. As numerous commentators have pointed out, there has been a steady trending away from classical broadcast journalism for at least a decade, with increased youth trending, anti-intellectual trending, informality trending, the 24-hour newscycle, and other factors driving mainstream television newscasting (<a href="#b28" rel="references:#b28" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">McChesney and Nichols 2010</a>; <a href="#b41" rel="references:#b41" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Vesperi 2010</a>).<a href="#en8" rel="references:#en8" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>8</sup></a> There is also a much longer media history to the importance of familiar and intimate broadcasting personalities (<a href="#b35" rel="references:#b35" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Scannell 1996</a>), intimate publics (<a href="#b42" rel="references:#b42" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Warner 2002</a>), and the prominent use of viewer and audience contributed content.<a href="#en9" rel="references:#en9" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>9</sup></a></p></div><div class="para"><p>In light of the material considered above, these new formats seem to play into the media ideologies expressed by the young critics in my recorded conversations.

They portend a different kind of public &ldquo;we,&rdquo; one of conjoined newsmakers/news consumers, that is, the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of Alicia's &ldquo;And shouldn't we be focusing on what is happening?&rdquo; At the same time, the dominant face of CNN, even with the Web 2.0 integrations, continues Habermasian ideals of seriousness and factuality, that is, ideals about being a public arena for presenting and discussing &ldquo;what's going on&rdquo; and what are matters of public concern, while it simultaneously erases the power relations behind its modes of production. And, still in line with ideals about genuine open communication, though with a slightly different alignment of participant roles, these new formats continue to project an ideal of the generic person (iReport's &ldquo;people like you&rdquo;) as the ideal engagement point for participation.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="ss7"><div class="headingCont"><h3>Conclusion</h3></div><ol class="jumpList"><li><a href="#leftBorder" shape="rect">Top of page</a></li><li><a href="#abstract" shape="rect">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#ss2" shape="rect">Conversations with Young Adults: Complications of Stereotyped Engagement and &ldquo;Apathy&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href="#ss3" shape="rect">Points of Engagement</a></li><li><a href="#ss4" shape="rect">Generic Personhood and the Semiotics of Audience Construction and Involvement</a></li><li><a href="#ss5" shape="rect">Young People's Disaffections with Mainstream News Media</a></li><li><a href="#ss6" shape="rect">CNN Television News Media Ideologies in a Web 2.0 Environment</a></li><li><a href="#ss7" shape="rect">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#ss9" shape="rect">References</a></li></ol><div class="para"><p>As an anthropological and phenomenological problem, media and public sphere &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; and &ldquo;disengagement&rdquo; is a conceptual minefield (cf. <a href="#b13" rel="references:#b13" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Couldry et&nbsp;al. 2007</a>), perhaps one that that is necessarily imprecise, as it involves sensibilities, experiences, and practices of connection and belongingness which are themselves far-ranging and sometimes ineffable. The complexities of subjectivity, responsibility, ideal citizenship, access, pleasure, and knowledge all cross-sect this arena, as well as issues of race, class, gender, family socialization, and peer socialization. In this article I have argued that investigations of engagement, like investigations about mediation, are most productively pitched as analyses at the intersection of production, textuality, and reception. Here, I have focused specifically on how ideologies and projections of generic personhood and genuine communication are key operators in processes of public connection, tracking how they appear within the semiotics of mainstream television newscasting, young adults' (dis)connections and critiques of this media genre, and both &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;old&rdquo; media ideologies and formats.</p></div><div class="para"><p>Significantly, many of the stances that people take as disengaged&mdash;or at least how this emerges in their discourse in the context of peer conversation groups and interviews&mdash;are articulated within a media and communication ideology frame that presupposes that genuine communication is taking place, or could take place, or should take place in the genre of newscasting. Their stances respond to the versions of generic personhood proffered to them, as &ldquo;real,&rdquo;&ldquo;attentive,&rdquo; and &ldquo;interested&rdquo; listeners or viewers in a mass audience. And sometimes and even perhaps most of the time, this reading of &ldquo;generic good audience member&rdquo; is undergirded with another layer of assumptions imported from the realm of interpersonal verbal communication, namely that on the receiving end, a set of interpersonal responsibilities ensue: to understand, process, and respond. Many people who disengage target some aspect of this ideal type and its internal set of equivalences. They say that they cannot or will not measure up; they measure their normativity in terms of it. Or, alternatively, they target the illusory ways in which these expectations have been set up by media producers.</p></div><div class="para"><p>When we put a linguistic lens on issues of public construction and public sphere engagement, there is much more work to be done beyond tracking the semiotics of audience address and reference. From both the production and the reception end, people are working with culturally-specific models of what communication is all about and what it should be, within particular known genres of communication. For the subset of young adults that I have discussed here, I have argued that encounters with the mainstream television newscast genre are shaped by a model of what sincere and felicitous communication looks like and feels like.<a href="#en10" rel="references:#en10" class="noteLink" title="Link to note" shape="rect"><sup>10</sup></a> Generic personhood and genuine personhood are a core part of this. This seems to be the case even with the young adults who exhibit a split consciousness or double-layered assessment of the mediated connection process, one that casts the reality of mainstream media outlets' &ldquo;real news&rdquo; as an irony and gravitates toward <em>The Daily Show,</em> but still embraces hegemonic ideals of genuine public communication, the importance of caring about &ldquo;what is going on,&rdquo; and the erasure (or downplaying) of power and interest. It seems then that even in very troubled times (and perhaps even in highly participatory Web 2.0 times), certain media production and consumption practices continue to hold ideologies of good journalism, plain talk, and everyman's America close on the horizon, as something desirable and obtainable. Perhaps these media ideologies are worth rethinking and even challenging, particularly in the Web 2.0 era alongside the possible dissemblance or distraction of participation as democracy. In short, I am suggesting that Alicia's cry to &ldquo;focus[] on what is happening&rdquo; is more than a millennial critique. It is an enduring story about public struggles and erasures in the construction of legitimate points of engagement.</p></div></div><div class="noteGroup"><span class="notesHeading">Notes</span><ul id="footnotes" class="noteGroup custom"><li id="en0"><div class="text"><p><div class="para"><p><em>Acknowledgments.</em> For their close readings and very insightful feedback, I wish to thank my anonymous <em>JLA</em> reviewers, the <em>JLA</em> editors Miyako Inoue and Paul Manning, Ilana Gershon, Asif Agha, John Jackson, Robert Moore, Michael Silverstein, Daymon Smith, Michael Warner, Stanton Worthman, and the students in my Spring 2010 ANT 512 class.

Fifty-one total people were involved (30 F, 21 M). The basic idea was to try to create as much as possible a naturally occurring conversation among friends and peers. The methodological principle behind this was to try to capture young people talking to each other, rather than to the researcher, but of course the reason for gathering was itself artificially constructed as was the fact that a researcher and an audiorecorder were there. Each group consisted of three to four people who knew each other, who were the same year in college and who shared the same general level of news media use. Thirteen groups were recruited and moderated by undergraduate research assistants; one group was recruited and moderated by a graduate research assistant, and one group was recruited and moderated by myself.</p></div></li><li id="en2"><span class="bullet">2</span><div class="text"><p>             Phase 2 consisted of individual interviews with both Phase 1 participants (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;9; 4 F, 5 M) and other young adults at Emory and in the Atlanta area (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;27; 11 F, 16 M), including students at other colleges and universities and individuals currently not attending college.
