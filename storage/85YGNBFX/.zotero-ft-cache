Association of Depression With Reduced Heart Rat& Variability in
Coronary Artery Disease

Decreased heart rate (HR) variability is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiac populations. Clinical depression has also been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study tests the hypothesis that depressed patients with CAD have decreased HR variability compared with nondepressed CAD patients. Nineteen patients with angiographically documented CAD and either major or minor depression were compared with a sample of nondepressed CAD patients according to age, sex, and

smoking status. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the standard deviation of all normalto-normal intervals was used as the prima index of HR variability. HR variability was significan 5 lower in depressed than nondepressed patients (90 + 35 vs 117 f 26 ms; p sO.Ol), even after adjustin for relevant covariates. Thus, decreased HR variabi Pity may help explain the increased risk for cardiac mortality and morbidity in depressed CAD patients.
