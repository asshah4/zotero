motor centres represent only movements of the eyes and head, and not movements of all parts of the body, as I do.

Delivered at the Royal College of Physicians,I March, 1884. By J. HUGHLINGS JACKSON, M.D., F.R.S., F.R. C. P.,

In further exposition, I shall speak, for the most part, of movements
only; for I believe that no one has ever denied that convolutions re-
present impressions (or, as is sometimes inaccurately said, sensations,

states and nervous states. I now pay particular regard to it. Here it ported by very different kinds of evidence.

'is well to remark that, as Spencer says, "the doctrine of evolution, 1. I postulate that in an epileptic seizure, since consciousness is lost

under its purely scientific form, does not involve materialism, though its opponents persistently represent it as doing so." He speaks of the materialistic hypothesis as being "utterly futile." To describe Spencer, Huxley, and Tyndall as materialists, is as absurd as speaking of Sir

A consideration of the facts of epileptic paroxysms leads, I submit, to the conclusion that the highest centres represent, through the intermediation of the middle and lowest

A man has both a mind and -a body. On the principle of doing one thing at a time, I shall, in this lecture, first, speak of the body only. A man, physically regarded, is

over the body; there are, in such cases, effects so various as spasm of ocular and hand muscles, pallor of the face, flow of saliva, perspiration, changes in the circulation (sometimes stopping of the heart's action, as Moxon has insisted), and arrest of respiration; there is often in, or just after, these slight fits, a discharge of feces and

Movements of the hands and eyes ; (3) articulatory lmovements and

conclusion froin this evidence, very imnperfectly and incompletely

stated I admiit, is that the highest centres represent, at any rate, very

many, and certainly most dillerent, parts of the )o(ly. The. two ultterly

different kinlds of evidence converge to the same con'lusioni. Taking

them together, we see that there is no incongruity in asserting that

both epilepsy and insanity arc diseases of the highest centres. In.

health, will, memory, reason, and emotion, or, in other words, a state

of consciousness, arise during slight sequent activities of sensori-motor

nervous arrangements of the highest centres, representing all parts of thle

body. Al epileptic seizure is owinig to a sudden and excessive discharge

of very many of these sensori-motor nervous arrangemenets iiearly simiul-

tneously. During such discharges, consciousness ceases, and from

them, taking into account secondary dlownward discharges of middle

iand tertiary discharges of lowest centres-there results that contention

of innumelrable movements of all parts of the body, which we call uni-

i'ersal convulsion. Taking a case of insanity which, like epilepsy, is

a disease of the highest centres, the averment is that thle negative

element, defect of consciousness, implies loss of, or loss of function of,

for illutstration, .the topmost layer of the highest centres. This,

onl the hypothesis that the highest centres are sensori-motolr, is causa-

tive pf somne trifling widely distributed paralysis. The positive ele-

meat (illusions, etc.) is mnentation or consciousness going onl during

activity of the lower level remaiLing, second layer. This, thle highest

mentation then possible, occurs during activities, stronger than nor-
