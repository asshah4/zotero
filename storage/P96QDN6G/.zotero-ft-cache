1961 .-The relationships

of changes in respiration

and brain

blood flow index to alterations venous blood pCO2, [HCO,],

in arterial and internal jugular
and plA were studied in normal

men. Observations during control of alveolar pCO2, first at 44 and then at 50 mm Hg, represented the effects of CO2 breathing, Intravenous infusion of NaHC03 solution (ca. 2.4

mEq/kg) while maintaining alveolar pC0z at 50 mm Hg revealed the responses to a lowering of blood [H+] without: concurrent change in arterial or internal jugular venous pCO2. Brain blood flow index varied directly with alteration

in blood pC0~ and was unaffected by changes in blood pH not produced by pC02 change. Respiratory measurements indicated a prominent relationship between respiration and

blood hydrogen ion concentration, the reversal of the acidemia normally associated with CO 2 administration removing approximately 4570 of respiratory stimulation induced by hyper-

capnia. The remaining 55% of the increased ventilation caused by CO2 breathing was not directly related to changes in arterial or internal jugular venous blood pH or [HCO,]. The residual

respiratory effect of CO2 administration was correlated, not only with alteration of pCO2, but with calculated changes in the pH of cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the total respiratory stimulation produced by CO2 breathing, and its diminution

by bicarbonate infusion, can be quantitatively described either in terms of a single stimulus index, hydrogen ion concentration, or in terms of two factors, pH and pCU2. Choice

between single and muItiple acid-base factors as indices of chemical stimuli in respiratory control remains arbitrary. However, the discussion re-emphasizes that, while respiratory changes do occur when blood pH is altered without: change of

blood or central pCO2, comparable stimulant effects of molecular CO2 cannot be demonstrated without somewhere producing concurrent modification of pH.

ment of the brain must depend largely upon the selective reactivity of respiratory neurons to minute chemical changes in their own local environment. This concept of response to local environment, often expressed (I, 2) and undoubtedly sound, appears also to apply to a secondary mechanism for central nervous system homeostasis, i.e., chemical regulation of the tone of brain vascular smooth muscle cells (3-5). In neither instance does this rational concept yet lend itself to definitive study, since in neither instance have there been established the mechanisms by which cellular excitation is affected by local chemical changes.
The exceptional potency of increased inspired COz as a respiratory stimulant and relaxant of brain vessels has led to extensive studies aimed at determining mechanisms whereby intrinsically produced CO2 might influence the activity of respiratory neurons and affect cerebral vascular tone. On the basis of these studies various investigators have expressed convictions concerning the individual or collective roles of such specific chemical factors as bicarbonate ion, hydrogen ion, and CO2 itself. The history of these important investigations is presented in several recent reviews which point to the continued uncertainty regarding the qualitative nature and even the site of action of chemical factors in normal respiratory and brain circulatory control (I, 2, 6, 7). Certainly the possibilities for quantitative appraisal of the independent influences of proposed stimuli have not yet been thoroughly explored.
The present study was carried out in an attempt to make a quantitative assessment in man of the relationships of changes in ventilation and in cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference to the alterations in blood acid-base variables produced by inhalation of carbon dioxide. Levels of hypercapnia in the region of the normal homeostatic adjustment of pCOz were chosen. The primary technical objective of the study to be reported was the experimental separation of the normally interdependent blood parameters pCO2 and pH in both
arterial and internal jugular venous blood. This was accomplished by intravenous infusion of sodium bicar-
bonate solution during artificial regulation of alveolar (arterial) pCOz at an essentially constant, selected level

above normal (8, g, IO). By this means an effort was made to determine responses of unnarcotized subjects to COZ-induced acidemia and the nearly exact reversal of acidemia during persistent hypercapnia.

METHODS
The experiments were conducted at the prevailing atmospheric pressure and room temperature (Table 2).

General Procedure

Each experiment consisted of four main parts, herein-

after called phases 1, 11, III, and W. In phase 1, measure-

ments were obtained when the subject’s alveolar pCO2

had been artificially adjusted to approximately 44 mm

Hg. Immediately thereafter, alveolar pCOs was adjusted

to approximately

50 mm Hg and measurements re-

peated (phase 11) to obtain indices of respiratory and

circulatory responses to simultaneous *increase in blood

pCO2 and cH. 2 A solution of sodium bicarbonate was

then infused intravenously to abolish the COZ-induced

acidemia, and while again maintaining alveolar pCOz at

50 mm Hg, measurements were repeated (phase III).

ln all but one subject a delayed duplication of sampling

was obtained after the sodium bicarbonate infusion

(phase IV).

Subjects
Table I shows the ages and body measurements of the five normal men used as subjects for this study. All these subjects were familiar with the sensations of carbon dioxide inhalation and intravenous infusion, but were not informed regarding the order of experimental procedures or the exact agent to be infused on a particular day. The subjects reported to the laboratory in the morning in a fasted state and rested in a supine position for approximately 20 minutes following completion of vaScular punctures and other preparations. The subjects were blindfolded throughout each phase of the experiments,

* For convenience the term cH will be used in figures and discussion to represent pH with reversal of the positive or negative sign. Thus, an increase in acidity will be considered an increase in cH rather than being cited as a fall in pH. Over the small range
of values in the present study AcH may be considered linearly related with A[H+], which may be substituted for AcH upon introduction of the appropriate constant.

Artijcial Control of Alveolar PC&

The method employed for regulation of end-tidal

pCO2 at supranatural levels has been described in detail

elsewhere (8). Pertinent to this study is that respiratory

measurements and blood sampling were carried out only

after the subject had been held stable at the desired

pCO2 for a minimum of 7 minutes. Gases employed

or pCO2 control throughout all phases of the study

consisted of water-pumped,

compressed air, and mix-

tures of CO2 and 2 I % 02 in Nf. A mouthpiece and nose

clip were employed in preference to a mask to minimize

lag time in alveolar pCO2 control. Since ventilation in

all phases was greater than normal, it was expected that

influences of change in ~02 upon chemoreceptor activity

would be negligible.

Infusion of Sodium Bicarbonate Solution

Prior to beginning measurements, an indwelling needle

was inserted into an antecubital vein and an intravenous

infusion of 5 % glucose in water was established at a

rate of approximately

0.5’ ml/min. The infusion con-

tinued during the first two phases of the study and pro-

vided a means for administering the solution of sodium

bicarbonate without disturbing the subject.

A dose of 2.4 mEq sodium bicarbonate/kg

body wt

was injected as a .8g molar solution into the tubing

of the infusion apparatus, beginning promptly after

completing the prebicarbonate measurements (phases 1

and 11). The injection of bicarbonate was accomplished

in an average time of 24 min (range I 5-33 min). The

dosages of bicarbonate were purposely matched to those

employed by Singer et al. (I I) to permit subsequent

intercomparisons of effects. Subsequent to the infusion

measurements were repeated, sometimes with a delay

for urination to assure subject comfort.

Respiratory Measurements

Expired gas was directed by means of low dead-space,

low resistance-breathing

valves and I -inch i.d. smooth-

bore tubing through a high capacity (I 42 liters/min),

rotary, wet-test gasometer. From measurements of gas

volume expired and the number of respirations over a

5-min sampling period, average rate, depth, and minute

volume of respiration were determined.

Blood Sampling and AnaZysis

Nineteen-gauge femoral arterial and internal jugular

venous blood sampling needles were inserted after

infiltrating the respective puncture sites with 3 ml of

2 % and I % procaine hydrochloride

solution. These

indwelling needles and the ~-mm bore plastic tubing

connecting them to manifolds of Luerlok stopcocks (12)

permitted blood to be sampled without the awareness

of the subject. A pair of specially designed, electrically

connected to the manifolds permitted a single individual to carry out simultaneous, constant-rate sampling of arterial and internal jugular venous blood over the entire 5-min period of respiratory measurements (I 3). All blood measurements except hemoglobin 02 capacity were performed upon anaerobically transferred aliquots of these integrated samples. The arterial blood sampled for 02 capacity was obtained in a separate, heparinized syringe after flushing the syringe dead space with 2 ml of blood prior to actual sampling. Blood samples for gas-content measurements were stored in ice-water slush prior to analysis; samples for pH determinations were not iced, but warmed to 37 C for immediate measurement.
All blood measurements were performed in duplicate. Blood CO2 and 02 contents were performed on ~-ml samples by the Van Slyke-Neil1 manometric method (I 4). Hemoglobin 02 capacity was determined by manometric measurement (I 5), after rotating a 6-ml blood sample at room temperature for I hour in a IOO-cc tonometer equipped to minimize evaporation of water.
Blood pH measurements were completed anaerobically within 15 min of sampling, using a McInnes-Belcher electrode system equilibrated to 37 C in a thermostatically controlled, shielded air bath, together with a Cambridge model R pH meter. Buffer checks were performed immediately before and after each blood pH measurement, using commercial buffers calibrated against National Bureau of Standards buffers. Actual temperature of blood pH measurement was checked to within &O.I C by means of a calibrated thermistor thermometer, the thermistor being mounted within the lumen of the tubular glass electrode. The subject’s deep body temperature was determined to within ho.1 C during each phase of the experiment, using for the purpose an indwelling rectal thermistor and the Wheatstone bridgegalvanometer circuit of the above-mentioned thermistor thermometer. Final pH and pCO2 values at the subject’s body temperature were obtained by the proced.ures outlined by Severinghaus et al. (I 6). In 26 consecutive pairs of pH measurements on samples of arterial and venous blood obtained in these experiments, the average difference and the standard deviation of the individual differences were ,003 & .002 pH units. Since the present study is based upon comparison of differences in pH and pCOz, error in duplicate pH measurements is more critical than is absolute error.
Calculations of percentage hemoglobin saturation and pOs were carried out in the normal manner (I 5)* For estimation of blood pCO2 and plasma bicarbonate a pK’ of 6.105 and a Bunsen solubility coefficient (15) of 0.501 were used. The values for pK’ and CO2 solubility in cerebrospinal fluid were those presented in a separate study (I 7).

Circulatory Measurements

Cerebral blood flow index is defined for the purposes

of this study as the ratio of the arterial-internal

jugular

venous 02 difference in phases II, III, or IV to the basic control arteriovenous 02 difference of phase I (44 mm pCO& As such, it differs but slightly in numerical value from previous usage in which the A-V 02 during air breathing at rest provided the denominator of the ratio (3, 18).
Mean arterial blood pressure was measured with an air-damped mercury manometer with zero pressure referred to a point IO cm anterior to the skin of the back. Pulse rate was counted during the period of respiratory measurements.
RESULTS
Mean measured and derived values obtained in the several phases of these experiments3 are presented in Table 2, and the significance of observed changes in Table 3.4
Fig. IA and B show the relationships of respiratory minute volume to arterial and internal jugular venous pCOz and pH during a) control of end-tidal pCOz at 44 mm Hg (phase I), b) systemic “respiratory” acidosis produced by elevating end-tidal pC02 to 50 mm Hg (phase 11), and c) reversal of the COs-induced acidosis by infusion of sodium bicarbonate intravenously while maintaining pCO2 at 50 mm Hg (phase 111)* The data of phase IV, obtained on only four subjects, is similar to that of phase 111, but is insufficient for statistical appraisal and will not be presented graphically. Relationships of blood pCOz and pH to tidal volume and to respiratory rate are essentially the same as illustrated for respiratory minute volume in Fig. IA and B. For ease of comparison, the figures are so scaled that the COz-induced change in pH is equivalent in size to the corresponding change in pCOz. The straight lines connecting the experimentally determined points of phases I (44 mm pCO2) and 11 (50 mm pCOz) represent only a convenience and an approximation over the short range to the actual COz-sensitivity curves for respiratory minute volume (19) and cerebral blood flow index (3, 18). In the lower regions of the normal COZ-response curves and with the small change in pCOz selected for this study, the illustrative use of straight connecting lines introduces no appreciable error.

to 50 mm Hg are closely paralleled by the pCOz and

pH changes of internal jugular venous blood. This

parallelism persisted when sodium bicarbonate solution

was infused. It is thus also evident that control of end-

tidal pCO2, through fixation of arterial CO2 tension,

provided a high degree of artificial control over central

levels of pCOz. This method of indirect, experimental

stabilization of central pC0~ would, of course, be

interfered with by any change in brain blood flow or

metabolism. Nevertheless, in this study, it was possible

to control internal jugular pC0~ so that the average

values observed before and after bicarbonate infusion

differed by only 0.5 mm Hg.

When alveolar pCOz was elevated, the expected rise

in arterial [HCO,] occurred, but brain venous [HCO,]

fell slightly. Thus, in COz-induced hyperventilation

as

in bicarbonate administration, respiratory changes were

negatively correlated with alterations of internal jugular

venous [HCO,].

Respiration
The data and Fig. r A and B indicate that the respiratory stimulation produced by a 6-mm Hg elevation of blood pCOz was considerably reduced, though not completely abolished, iYhen bicarbonate infusion lowered

blood cH. That the bicarbonate-induced

reduction of

rate, depth, and minute volume of respiration was

unrelated to change in the pCO2 of either arterial or

internal jugular venous blood is evident, since pre-

bicarbonate injection levels of blood pCO2 were closely

sustained during and after the infusion of base. It is

likewise evident that the residual respiratory stimulation

following bicarbonate infusion was unrelated to aci-

demia, since sufficient bicarbonate was administered to

more than reverse the original elevation of blood cH by

carbon dioxide. It should be noted that the figures

illustrate changes in respiratory minute volume rather

than alveolar ventilation, since in normal subjects the

former, like work of breathing (QO), is more represent-

ative of total respiratory drive than is alveolar ventila-

tion.

Circulation
Changes in cerebral blood flow index produced by hypercapnia and by bicarbonate infusion are shown in Fig. 2A and B. Since the changes in pCQ2 and pH produced in these experiments are known not to be associated with significant alterations of cerebral 02 consumption or CO2 production (5), the observed changes in cerebral blood flow index provide quantita-

tive expressions of alteration of cerebral blood flow.

Though of course only relative, the observed changes

should be, quantitatively, at least as precise as values

provided by the more complex nitrous oxide method for

absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow (I 2). The

figures show that the cerebral blood flow index was

elevated approximately

35 % by changing end-tidal

pC0~ from 44 to 50 mm Hg, and that reversal of the

COs-induced acidemia did not lower cerebral blood

flow below the level associated with 50 mm Hg end-tidal

pCO* prior to bicarbonate infusion. Thus, gross increase

in blood bicarbonate concentration and pH exerted no

significant effect upon CBF index when blood pCO2 was

not allowed to change (Table 3).

The small average changes in pulse rate and mean

arterial blood pressure associated with the induced

alterations in blood pCO2, [HCO:], and pH were not

statistically significant.

DISCUSSION
Much of the difficulty encountered in interpreting the extensive studies concerned with respiratory and brain circulatory control has been related to limited adaptability of data to quantitative appraisal. In the discussion which follows, emphasis will therefore be placed primarily upon quantitative aspects of the results obtained in the present experiments. Initially, it will be convenient for the relationships of acid-base factors to respiratory and brain circulatory control to be considered separately.
Respiratory Control
ArteriaZ and internal jugular venous blood. Of the conventionally considered chemical respiratory ‘<stimuli” in arterial or central venous blood, only cH fell when sodium bicarbonate was infused and pCOz held constant across the brain (phase 111). Assessment of the relationship of fall in blood cH to the concomitant lowering of respiratory rate, depth, and minute volume is somewhat complicated by the use of a dose of bicarbonate slightly in excess of that required for exact reversal of the acidemia produced by raising alveolar pCO2 from 44 to 50 mm Hg pCO2. Fig. 3 illustrates the approximate respiratory effect of more exact reversal of the COSinduced acidemia, using the values for cH and pCO2 obtained upon internal jugular venous blood. The dashed line connecting points LI and III indicates the pathway for the relationship of respiration to venous cH as increasing doses of sodium bicarbonate are administered and central pC02 is held essentially constant (in this case at about 5g mm Hg). This proposed pathway should pertain if infusion of base does not alter the slope of the respiratory response to COz-induced changes in cH. That this condition actually applies was verified by the results of a second series of experiments which will be reported separately in full (IO) and by the recent study of Loeschcke et al. (208). It further appears

that administration of HC1 in dogs (21) or production of acidosis with NH&l, CaC12, or acetazoleamide in man (22) fails to alter the slope of the pCOz-response curve.
Fig. 3 shows that reversal of acidemia (II to III’), while allowing hypercapnia to persist, removed approximately 45 % of the respiratory stimulation originally produced by elevating alveolar pCOz from 44 to 50 mm Hg. The remaining 55 % of the total increase in ventilation brought about by raising pCO:! must have been due to changes somehow connected with elevation of pCO2, but unrelated to alterations of the pH or [HCOr] of arterial or internal jugular venous blood (9, I 0). Similar proportionate association of respiration with changes of blood cH and pCOz in normal men can be derived (about 45%) f rom the equation of Gray (23) and from the data (about 43 %) of Loeschcke et aI. (24),
The change in pulmonary ventilation associated with change in blood cH observed in these and certain other studies in normal man (22-24) is large in comparison with the results of many experiments in animals and man (I, 2). In numerous instances, alteration of respiration during metabolic acidosis or acid infusion has been. slight, even in the face of gross change in arterial cH (I, 2) (25)* Usually in such experiments, the normal readjustments of blood pC0~ to change in alveolar ventilation have occurred as blood cH was altered. The
use of anesthetic agents in animal studies should further limit the respiratory response to acid infusion. Fig. 4. shows the magnitude of the association of changes in
ventilation with change in arterial cH found in three different situations. It is evident from the figure that the degree of respiratory stimulation per unit change in
blood cH, observed during pCO2 control in the unnarcotized normal subjects of the present study, is over 500 % greater than that described by Domizi et al. (26)
as a powerful effect of HCl infusion on the basis of a study also involving controlled alveolar pCOz, but using anesthetized dogs. It is noteworthy that the respiratory

response to an increase in cH produced by HCl in the

study by Domizi et al. (26) can, as in man, be shown

to average about 45 % of the response to an equivalent

acidemia induced by CO* administration.

In the normal

subjects, change in ventilation per unit increase in cH is

further seen to be more than ten times greater than that

found by Kety et al. (2 5) to accompany the severe

metabolic acidosis and hypocapnia of diabetes. The

finding in the present experiments, averaging approxi-

mately I. 7 liters/min/mz

for each .OI unit change in

blood cH, is in close quantitative agreement with the

observations made by Gray (23) and Loeschcke et al.

(24), using different methods for appraising the respira-

tory response to acidosis, and may be considered to

ExtravascuLar factors. While the change in ventilation

accompanying alterations of blood cH is large in normal

man as compared with the narcotized dog or the patient

in metabolic acidosis, it remains impossible to associate

more than about 45 % of COZ-induced hyperventilation

with alterations in the level of acidity in either arterial

or internal jugular venous blood. This effect is not

related to change in pCO2, hence it is not related to

changes in intracellular cH. The remaining 55 % of the

total ventilatory response to hypercapnia is distinctly

unassociated with change in the cH of circulating blood,

but does somehow relate to change in blood pCOz, or,

secondarily, to the cH or pCO2 of extravascular fluids

( 1, 2, 9). The present experiments do not provide the means for identifying either the nature or the actual

location of this latter effect of CO* administration.

Change in dissolved COX, as indicated by arterial pCO2

in Gray’s multiple factor equation (23, 27), could repre-

sent a stimulus distinct from change in cH and could

exert its effect centrally, at or within peripheral chemo-

receptors, or at both locations (I, 2). On the other hand,

recent studies by Loeschcke et al. (28) and Mitchel et

al. (zg) indicate that a respiratory response can be

elicited to changes in the cH of fluid perfusing the

fourth ventricle, even when the pCOz of the fluid remains

stable. These responses in cats (28) and dogs (2g), while

not gross in degree, suggest that at least some cells

concerned with respiratory control are so located

anatomically that they can be influenced in activity by

the composition of adjacent cerebrospinal fluid.

possible to employ the Henderson-Hasselbalch

equation

to calculate for these experiments the probable changes

in its acid-base composition during hypercapnia and the

subsequent intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate

dioxide (33), even into cerebrospinal fluid (a), it is

reasonable to expect that alteration of cerebrospinal

fluid cH in acute, stable-state experiments would be

determined almost exclusively by induced changes in

central pCO2 (2, 10, 31). To calculate the cH of cerebro-

spinal fluid in the present study, the pCOz of CSF was

considered to be essentially the same as that of internal

jugular venous blood [in dogs the pCOz of CSF appears

to be approximately 6 mm Hg higher that that of arterial

blood (3 I ), and in a study of this particular question in

man, no difference could be found between the pCO2 of

cisternal fluid and internal jugular venous blood (32)].

In addition to selection of reasonable values for pCO2,

and the assumption that [HCOJ of cerebrospinal fluid

was not appreciably altered throughout the several

phases of the study, calculation of cH in cerebrospinal

fluid required appropriate values for pK’ and solubility

of CO2 (I 7). Actually, estimation of the changes in-

duced in the cH of cerebrospinal fluid by administration

of CO* or NaHCO3 does not require knowledge of the

exact value for [HCOJ in CSF. For the purposes of this

study, the [HCOJ in cerebrospinal fluid was considered

to remain at 26.0 mEq/liter, close to that in the arterial

blood during air breathing at sea level (I 8). This may

be slightly in excess of the normal value for [HCOB] in

man (32).

Fig. 5A and B illustrate the relationships between

calculated values for the cH of CSF and the observed

values for respiration, and the pCO2 and cH of venous

blood in the three phases of the present study. In these

stable states, the respiratory stimulation produced by

raising alveolar CO2 tension should be accompanied by

increases of both pCO2 and cH both in the blood and

the cerebrospinal fluid. However, when bicarbonate is

infused to render the blood alkaline while the pCOz of

the blood and brain is held steady at the selected,

elevated level, the cerebrospinal fluid should remain in

the state of acidosis induced by CO* administration.

combined influences upon respiration of acid-base

during hypercapnia, unaffected by intravascular infusion

of different potential stimuli but, aside from identification

of a positive contribution of change in blood cH to

respiratory stimulation, offers no suggestion regarding

the nature or location of an effect of ApCOz. Neverthe-

less, like the original “multiple factor equation” (23)JJ

equation I is closely descriptive of a large number of

respiratory acid-base disturbances. Because sensitivity

to CO2 is extremely variable, the constants for this

Values for pH in cerebrospinal

fluid were calculated with the

equation, using values reported elsewhere

for the pK’ of cerebrospinal fluid (IT), an assumed stable cere-

[HCOJ of 26.0 mEq/liter and cerebrospinal fluid pCOz levels con-

sidered equal to those observed in internal jugular venous blood.

While A indicates that bicarbonate infusion lowered ventilation at

an essentially constant level of pCOz in blood, cerebrospinal fluid,

and brain, B suggests that reduction in ventilation accompanying

decreased acidemia occurred in spite of sustained acidosis of

cerebrospinal

fluid and, presumably,

intracellular

fluids of re-

Predictions of re@ratory change in acute acid-base imbalance.

In equations I and z the constants describing the degree

of respiratory response to change in blood cH and in

pCOz or CSF cH were obtained by employing the values,

summarized in Table 4, for elevation of pCO2 in the

present study (change from phase I to II). To compare

the effects of CO2 and sodium bicarbonate administra-

tion with various other forms of acute acid-base derange-

ment, constants for ARMV/.or AcHE in equation 3 were

derived for CO2 administration,

using the subjects of

this study and that of Loeschcke et al. (24), in which the

effects of COn breathing upon respiratory minute volume

and the pCO2 and pH of arterial blood were measured

as controls prior to administration of NH&l, CaC12 or

acetazoleamide (22, 24). The unreported values for pH

were kindly provided by these authors, The constants for

COP administration, together with the data from which

they were derived and the observed changes during acid-

base alteration, appear in Table 4, along with informa-

tion pertaining to the previously mentioned group of

patients in diabetic acidosis studied by Kety et al. (25).

Using the data summarized in Table 4, the experi-

mentally observed effects of the several acid-base dis-

turbances are compared with the values of ARMV

predicted from change in cH on the basis of the descrip-

tive equations 3 and 4. (Table 4, Fig. 6). No predicted

values appear in the table for CO2 breathing, since the

data for simple hypercapnia were the basis for deter-

mining the constants in the predictive equation. Fig. 6

shows that the concept of change in cH as a single index

of the chemical respiratory stimulus in regulation of

acid-base homeostasis provides striking agreement

between observed and predicted values for change in

ventilation in the normal subjects available for test.

Even the hyperventilation

of severe diabetic acidosis,

often cited as an example of the inadequacy of change in

[H+] as an index of the respiratory stimulus, is now seen

to be not grossly different from that calculated from

changes in blood and “CSF” cH. Actually, if the ex-

pected slight reduction of [HCO-1 in CSF occurred in

these patients, the discrepancy in Fig. 6 would be in part

erroneous. Similar close agreement between calculated

and observed values can be shown for respiratory rates

and tidal volumes in these conditions.

Relation to ’ ’multijde factor’ ’ and ccreuction” theories. The

preceding analysis relates, in normally oxygenated

individuals, both to the reaction theories of Winterstein

(I, 2) and the multiple factor theory of Gray (23). As

mentioned elsewhere (I, 2), the reaction theory has

successively emphasized the absolute influence upon

respiration of change in hydrogen ion concentration in

arterial blood, within the respiratory neurons and,

ultimately, at both central and chemoreflex receptors.

Whereas the support for the reaction theory has thus

far depended largely upon qualitative studies, the

present analysis indicates a quantitative correlation in

man between change in ventilation and change in

hydrogen ion concentration.

The present studies resemble the multiple factor theory

in that each provides a quantitative description of a

variety of acid-base disturbances, each attributes essen-

tially the same value to a respiratory effect of change in

blood cH, and each associates the remaining respiratory

drive to an action of CO2 not related to its effect upon

blood cH. Thus, the major differences between the

present interpretations and the multiple factor theory

include use in the latter of pCO2 as a factor separate

from the extravascular changes in cH which must be

induced by change in pCO2, and emphasis upon arterial

blood values for all indices of respiratory stimuli.

Limitations. Because of the extreme permeability of

cells and membranes to molecular CO2 (33), an acute

elevation of the physical pressure of CO2 in arterial blood

will result in an increase of cH both in intracellular and

extracellular fluids of the central nervous system. It is

for this well-known reason that unequivocal separate

appraisal of [Cog] and cH as potential respiratory

stimuli has not yet been accomplished, even when

techniques of direct injection into respiratory centers

have been used (35). In describing the respiratory

response to CO2 administration,

it therefore remains

necessary to select, on purely arbitrary grounds, either

change in CO2 tension, or extravascular change in cH,

as an index of the respiratory stimulus not related to

change in cH of the blood itself, With these limitations

clearly in mind, the chief objection to a multiple factor

concept and to the continued designation of arterial

pCO2 as a distinct factor in respiratory control is that

change in pCO2 (or [COJ) has never been shown to

affect respiration even qualitatively without the pC0~

change being somewhere accompanied by a corres-

ponding alteration of pH. Thus, respiratory effects

place of values for A cH and A pC0~ in arterial blood. In condition B, only arterial blood data were available. No predicted A RMV is

shown for simple CO2 breathing since observations of A RMV during CO2 inhalation were used to determine %ensitivity”

constants in

control equations ; for this reason observed and predicted values would be identical, In test of data for experimental

acidosis (22, 24), technique used for graphic equalization

of arterial pCO2 in 2 experimental

situations was considered as accom-

plishing the same fixation of central pCO2 as was achieved for the present study by artificial regulation of end-tidal pCOz (8). Pre-

diction of change in RMV during diabetic acidosis (25) was based on patients JS, MM, TH, C& and CC and the use of average response

to CO2 breathing of 4.07/.01 effective A cH in the 5 subjects of conditions A in this table.

designated as change in threshold to pCO2 (36) may in fact be related to change in stimulus level. Since change in pH of the blood (23, 26) or of the cerebrospinal fluid (28) does affect respiration without change in pCOz, it must be realized that, in selecting a stimulus index for respiration, the choice to be made remains between r) changes in a single chemical stimulus index which can be quantitatively correlated with changes in ventilation (Fig. 6) and z ) c h an g es in two different factors, one of which has not yet been demonstrated to have any independent respiratory stimulant properties* Whereas 2) appears unreasonable, there are situations such as simple CO2 breathing when, for practical purposes, it may be convenient and adequate to employ changes of pCO* as the sole index of the respiratory stimulus (19).
The descriptive expressions relating the single factor, cH, and respiration in the present study also have limitations. Even if it were presumed that CO2 breathing increases ventilation only via acidification of blood and other fluids, it remains uncertain how or even where the clearly demonstrable respiratory effects of changes in blood cH are effected. Central neurons are not directly exposed to circulating blood. Certainly equations z and 3, though expressing the quantitative adequacy of a singlestimulus index in the respiratory response to CO2 breathing, do not distinguish among a> the uniform influence of a single, composite cH change upon central respiratory neurons, b) actions of cH at different sites upon cells having perhaps different sensitivities to change in cH, c) integration of concurrent, but separate,

influences of blood and cerebrospinal fluid acid-base reaction upon nerve cells exposed both to blood and to cerebrospinal fluid, and d) possible direct or chemoreflex influences of change in blood cH upon the threshold of central respiratory neurons to changes in the cH of their own local environment.
There are further limitations which, while apparent, deserve mention here. In spite of the clear correlation of respiration with change in measureable factors such as cH, the mechanism by which any stimulant factor affects the activity either of central respiratory neurons or peripheral chemoreflex receptors is essentially unknown. Second, the quantitative relationships observed in the present study appear to pertain to conditions of acute respiratory stimulation and its removal; they do not necessarily relate to depression of breathing below the normal, eupneic level ( I I, 2oa, 37), or to some chronic alterations of acid-base balance (38, 39). Finally, there must be added the obvious fact that, in contrast to the responses in CO2 breathing, respiratory regulation in eupnea appears to involve fluctuations in reactivity of respiratory neurons to chemical stimuli, with inverse correlation between the magnitude of ventilation and the levels of cH or pCO2 in blood and central fluids.
Fig. 2 shows the increase in CBF index observed in the present study, with elevation of alveolar pCOz from 44 to 50 mm Hg. However, when arterial pCO% was

maintained at 50 mm Hg and the COZ-induced acidemia abolished by infusion of sodium bicarbonate, the CBF index remained as high as when pCO2 and cH were elevated together. Thus, in contrast to respiratory drive, the tone of cerebral vessels appears to be related almost quantitatively to change in pCO2 and to be unaffected by change in blood cH unless the latter is accompanied by alteration of CO2 tension. These findings in the region of normal acid-base balance may differ only in degree from those of severe metabolic acidosis (25), in which gross change in the acidity of blood is associated with a detectable diminution of cerebral vascular resistance, even though blood pCO2 is lower than normal.
The apparent relationship of cerebral blood flow index to change in the pCO2 and essential independence of change in the cH of blood perfusing the brain still does not assure a direct role for molecular CO:! in control of brain circulation. As in the case of part of the respiratory response to CO2 breathing, it is not yet possible to effect experimental separation of the roles of CO2 and H+ Therefore although the effects of increased CO2 tension in blodd upon the tone of brain vessels may be brought about by some primary action of the CO2 molecule (such as inert gas narcosis), the ready passage of CO2 into cells (33) may produce the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells indirectly, as through the changes this induced in intracellular cH.

the major link between the mechanisms of respiratory

control and those concerned with the regulation of over-

all brain circulation. Under normal circumstances,

breathing air, the linkage of respiratory and brain

circulatory control via arterial pCOz should tend to

regulation of the brain circulation and, hence, of the

internal environment of the brain can be considered in

large measure to be passive consequences of an active

response by respiratory neurons to acid-base changes in

their own local environment (40, 41). Even in a system

of interrelated respiratory and brain circulatory control,

the different effects upon respiration and cerebral blood

flow index resulting from change in cH and pCOz are

not surprising. While CO2 is prominently involved in the

regulation of each function, there is no reason to expect

that the ultimate biophysical mechanisms by which

change in pCOz produces relaxation and contraction of

smooth muscle cells in cerebral vessels are the same as

the mechanisms which increase and decrease the rate of

electrical discharge by the neurons of the respiratory

centers. The results of the present study offer no direct

information bearing upon this question. However, they

are quantitatively compatible with the possibilities that

[H+] may be intimately involved within each system

(perhaps extracellularly

for respiratory neurons and

intracellularly for smooth muscle cells), and that molecu-

lar COs has no direct role in either.
