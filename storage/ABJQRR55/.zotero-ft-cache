Function in Atrial Fibrillation

The validity and reproducibility of systolic function assessment in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) using cardiac magnetic resonance, echocardiography, nuclear imaging and computed tomography is unknown. A prospectively-registered systematic review was performed, including 24 published studies with patients in AF at the time of imaging and reporting validity or reproducibility data on left ventricular systolic parameters (PROSPERO: CRD42018091674). Data extraction and risk of bias were performed by 2 investigators independently and synthesized qualitatively. In 3 cardiac magnetic resonance studies (40 AF patients), left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume measurements correlated highly with catheter angiography (r ≥0.85), and intra- and/or interobserver variability were low. From 3 nuclear studies (171 AF patients), there were no external validation assessments but intra and/or interobserver and intersession variability were low. In 18 echocardiography studies (2,566 AF patients), 2 studies showed high external validity of global longitudinal strain and tissue Doppler s’ with angiography-derived dP/dt (r ≥0.88). Global longitudinal strain and myocardial performance index were both associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Reproducibility of echocardiography was better when selecting an index-beat (where 2 preceding R-to-R intervals are similar) compared to averaging of consecutive beats. There were no studies relating to computed tomography. Most studies were small and biased by selection of patients with good quality images, limiting clinical extrapolation of results. The validity of systolic function measurements in patients with AF remains unclear due to the paucity of good-quality data. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol 2021;139:40−49)

Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) prevalence is expected to rise considerably over the next few decades.1 To enable clinicians to provide appropriate therapy and improve prognosis, it is essential that systolic function can be accurately assessed.2 Echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), computed tomography (CT), invasive angiography, and nuclear scintigraphy are all used to assess systolic function. However, cardiac imaging in patients with AF is challenging due to R-to-R (RR) interval irregularity and/or elevated heart rate3 which impact on validity and reproducibility, causing difﬁculties in acquiring diagnostic-quality images and interpretation of results.4 The assumption that parameters used to quantify systolic dysfunction in patients with sinus rhythm have the same validity in AF may also be incorrect.5,6 The aim of this systematic review was to

determine if different modalities of systolic assessment have clinical value in patients with AF, to assist in the diagnosis of heart failure and guide optimal management for patients.
Methods
All studies reporting validity or reproducibility data on left ventricular (LV) systolic function in AF patients were examined. There was no restriction on study design, however only human populations with AF at the time of imaging were included. Exclusion criteria were case reports, studies that were only published in abstract form, and those in a language other than English. All editorials, commentaries and informal reviews of other literature were also excluded. An online search was performed of PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE through the OVID library (inception to February 2019), including the broad terms “atrial ﬁbrillation,” “angiography,” “computed tomography,” “cardiac magnetic resonance,” “nuclear imaging,” and “echocardiography” using MESH headings and title and/or abstract searches, including syntax variations (Supplementary Table 1). We also conducted manual screening of relevant reviews and reference lists. The review was prospectively published on PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php? RecordID=91674) and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
The primary outcomes of interest were the validity and reproducibility of LV systolic assessment in AF patients using different imaging modalities. For echocardiography,

these included LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (measured either by Simpson’s biplane method or three-dimensional [3D] volume assessment), fractional shortening, stroke volume derived from LV outﬂow tract pulsed wave Doppler, tissue Doppler velocities, pre-ejection period derived myocardial performance index (MPI), peak longitudinal systolic strain and global longitudinal strain (GLS). For CMR, this included volume-derived LVEF, GLS using either feature tracking or myocardial tagging, and stroke volume derived from ﬂow mapping in the aortic root. For nuclear medicine, this included measurements of LVEF derived from radionuclide equilibrium angiography, gated single photon positron emission tomography (SPECT) and gated positron emission tomography. We extracted data systematically using a standardized extraction form to ascertain: (1) validity against other imaging modalities (external validation); (2) association with clinical or surrogate end points; (3) comparison within an imaging modality (internal validity); and (4) measurements of intra- and interoperator reproducibility.
Two investigators independently assessed inclusion at full text level and extracted relevant variables (KB and KO). Disagreements were resolved by consensus review and additional independent adjudication (DK). Variables of interest for validity were strength of association using correlation (r) and intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC), and agreement using Bland and Altman analysis. For association with clinical parameters, hazard ratios, chi-squared tests, area under the curve and Kaplan-Meier analysis were also included. Variables of interest for reproducibility were agreement using Bland and Altman analysis and mean difference, association measured using correlation coefﬁcients, linear regression (r2) and ICC, and variability measured using percentage change, coefﬁcient of variation and repeatability coefﬁcient. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2.7 Risk of bias was similarly assessed by 2 investigators independently, covering bias and applicability on the level of patient selection, the index test, reference standard and study ﬂow and timing (Supplementary Table 2).
Baseline demographics were pooled from all studies providing suitable data (including variance where applicable), and are summarized as a weighted mean according to sample size. Outcomes were synthesized qualitatively. Meta-analysis of comparative data between AF and sinus rhythm was not possible due to the limited studies available and a lack of published data on the variance of outcome measures.
Results
The search strategy identiﬁed a total of 7,382 papers of which 7,058 were excluded mainly due to a lack of relevance to the research question. After the full text was screened, a further 310 studies were excluded leaving a total of 24 studies which were then sorted into each imaging modality (Figure 1). Overall risk of bias is presented in Figure 2, highlighting concern about patient selection bias. Results are presented by imaging modality in the text below, and are categorized in the tables according to external validity (Table 1), internal validity (Table 2), association with clinical or surrogate end points (Table 3), and reproducibility (Table 4). The full list of included

studies with population details and methods is presented in Supplementary Table 3.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
Three CMR studies were included, assessing a total of 40 AF patients with breath-hold cines using steady-state free precession imaging (SSFP) of the LV to calculate stroke volume or LVEF. We identiﬁed no studies assessing the reproducibility or validity of phase mapping or strain imaging in patients with AF at the time of imaging. The method of patient selection, and ﬂow and timing of data obtained was unclear for these studies; hence the risk of bias was unclear.
One study externally validated CMR parameters of LVEF and stroke volume against invasive catheter angiography in 13 AF patients; 3 of these patients were excluded due to frequent ventricular ectopy, the need to void, or data corruption.8 Of the remaining patients, “several” required hand-drawn endocardial borders rather than the semi-automated process due to insufﬁcient contrast with the blood pool (this may have led to differential risk of bias compared to 12 patients in sinus rhythm). CMR-derived LVEF was shown to correlate strongly with left ventriculography (r = 0.85), with a mean difference of 0% (SD 0.08) and no excess variability compared to sinus rhythm patients (p = 0.37). Similar results were seen for CMR-derived stroke volume using both ﬂow-based and volume-based measurements. Another study internally validated LVEF by comparing compressed sensing and parallel imaging (SPARSE-SENSE) with conventional SSFP in 20 patients with AF; they identiﬁed a strong correlation between techniques (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99; p = 0.14), but heart rate at the time of assessment was not stated.9
Three studies examined the reproducibility of systolic parameters using CMR. LVEF interobserver reproducibility in 10 patients was better using CMR as compared to angiography (SE 8% vs 14%), with similar results for stroke volume (SE 9 ml vs 24 ml), but again no comment on heart rate.8 In 20 patients there was no relevant difference in intra and/or interobserver reproducibility between SSFP and real-time SPARSE-SENSE. In 10 patients with permanent AF and a mean heart rate of 82 bpm (range 57 to 109), intraobserver reproducibility was good (r2 = 0.97), repeatability coefﬁcient was 3.8 and Bland and Altman bias was À1.9%. Interstudy reproducibility was also good (r2 = 0.99), with repeatability coefﬁcient 1.3 and Bland and Altman bias of 0.5%.10
Nuclear imaging
We identiﬁed no studies in which systolic parameters were externally validated or correlated with other clinical parameters in patients with AF. Three nuclear imaging studies were included that addressed either internal validity (i.e., against other nuclear imaging) or reproducibility, with a total of 171 AF patients. The method of patient selection, and degree of blinding to the index and reference test was not stated clearly in these studies, making the risk of bias unclear.

coronary artery disease.11 Gated SPECT in this study had a strong correlation with equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (r = 0.89; p <0.0001), however LVEF measured by SPECT was consistently lower by 3% to 4%. In a study

of 20 AF patients, cycle length windowing as a way to overcome the variable rhythm in AF showed similar LVEF values compared to nonwindowed parameters (p = 0.16), with strong correlation between the 2 methods (r = 0.97).12

Echocardiography
Eighteen echocardiography studies were included, with a total of 2,566 AF patients. The method of patient selection for most echocardiography studies incurred a high risk of bias, due to the exclusion of patients with poor imaging windows.
Two studies (total 64 patients) externally validated echocardiographic systolic parameters against dP/dt derived from invasive angiography, with GLS found to have a strong correlation with averaged dP/dt (r = 0.94; p <0.001).14 The tissue Doppler parameter s’ was also shown to correlate strongly with dP/dt (r = 0.88; p <0.0001).15 Eight studies compared echocardiographic indices of systolic function with clinical parameters or surrogate biomarkers.16−23 In 1293 AF patients who had suffered a myocardial infarction, lower LVEF (estimated using an echocardiographic wall motion score) was associated with an increase in the risk of 30-day mortality (8% for patients with LVEF >50%, 10% for LVEF 36% to 50%, 24% for LVEF 26% to 35% and 40% for LVEF <25%).19 However, lower LVEF did not appear to predict long-term mortality in AF patients. Lower GLS was associated with adverse cardiovascular events in 2 studies of 196 and 204 AF patients,17,20 with similar results seen with global circumferential strain and when GLS was corrected for RR interval.21 MPI was associated with cardiovascular events in 196 patients (hazard ratio 1.10 per 0.1 unit increase; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.18; p = 0.004).22 In 104 patients with AF, Simpson’s biplane LVEF correlated only weakly with B-type natriuretic peptide (r = À0.25; p = 0.07).16 Similar results were seen for atrial natriuretic peptide in 67 patients using Teichholz-derived LVEF (r = À0.42, p = 0.01).18
Four studies performed internal validation with other echocardiographic parameters (Table 2).24−27 Eight studies assessed reproducibility, but there have been no echocardiographic studies comparing reproducibility directly with other imaging modalities. A variety of small studies have demonstrated low levels of intra and interobserver variability for LVEF, GLS, and MPI when reassessing systolic function in AF patients using echocardiography (Table 4). Three-dimensional measurement of LVEF was shown to be more reproducible when calculated using a single-beat analysis compared to 4-beat averaging (intraobserver variability 4.8% vs 8.3%; interobserver 5.6% vs 18%).28 An index-beat approach, whereby measurement is made following 2 RR intervals of similar length resulted in lower intra and interobserver variability compared to conventional averaging of consecutive beats.14,17,29

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst systematic review of the validity and reproducibility of systolic measurements made using standard cardiovascular imaging modalities for patients in AF at the time of assessment. Adequate data on external validation against clinical events or surrogate outcomes is severely lacking, meaning that the clinical utility of systolic function assessment in the context of AF is uncertain particularly for CMR, nuclear and CT imaging modalities where there were no validation studies with clinical outcome. Comparison of validity and reproducibility between different imaging modalities is also extremely limited; hence measurements of systolic LV function commonly used in patients with AF cannot reliably be interchanged. Assessment of systolic function in patients with AF is performed in every cardiac center globally, and yet there is limited scientiﬁc data on measurement quality or validity (Figure 3).
Most of the studies included in this systematic review addressed echocardiography, with limited examination of other modalities. Even within echocardiography, there is a clear lack of external validation. CMR is generally considered the gold-standard method for assessing systolic function in routine practice,30 however in AF patients we do not have sufﬁcient data on direct comparison with high-ﬁdelity invasive pressure assessment. dP/dt is only a good marker for end-systolic elastance (the true gold standard for assessing LV contractility) when arterial pulse pressure variation is low,31 which is unlikely in those with AF. There have been no studies externally validating LVEF in AF patients, which is a concern given that this measurement is used as a key parameter to guide patient management.2 In heart failure patients with sinus rhythm, LVEF is closely related to clinical outcomes, with each 5% lower LVEF increasing the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (n = 14,261 patients; 95% CI 21% to 28%; p <0.0001).6 However in patients with AF, the relationship of LVEF with clinical outcomes

is less substantial, with a 9% increase in mortality per 5% lower LVEF (95% CI 3% to 15%; p = 0.002), likely reﬂecting the higher variability in AF patients.6 LVEF thresholds guide management decisions for patients.2 This highlights the importance of understanding the accuracy and validity of systolic function assessment in patients with AF; unfortunately our review suggests that this is far from secure. GLS has been shown to provide prognostic information and so may be a reliable method of assessing systolic function in patients with AF, however these studies were all highly biased for only selecting patients with adequate echocardiographic windows.17,20,21
The reproducibility of LVEF appears to be reasonable in these AF studies, with low levels of intra- and interobserver variability. However, the patients included were selected for good quality imaging32,33 and reproducibility assessment did not include the full range of testing (for example, repeatability and reliability).4 These studies are unlikely to represent the AF population scanned in routine practice, as AF patients usually have multiple co-morbidities such as obesity and airways disease limiting image quality. Moreover, the same images were often re-analyzed, rather than the study itself repeated, thereby excluding the intersession variability in measurements that would be expected in clinical practice. For calculation of parameters, guidelines recommend averaging 5 to 10 consecutive beats in patients with AF,34,35 which is time-consuming and is often not completed in routine care.22 In contrast, the use of an index-beat has been shown to be reproducible and could have advantages over averaging beats in AF.14,20,28,29
Finally, in all studies where heart rate was reported, values were within a well-controlled range of 60 to 90 beats per minute. There have been no studies assessing the validity or reproducibility of systolic parameters when heart rates are outside this range. It is generally considered that measurements taken in patients with a ventricular rate >100 bpm are unreliable,36 however there have been no

studies to allow us to make an evidence-based recommendation.
In conclusion, there is a clear need for external validation of systolic measurements in patients with AF and also interoperator and/or intersession studies to better assess reproducibility. Data on the validity of measurements in CMR, nuclear imaging and CT were extremely limited, making it difﬁcult to draw any conclusions. A major limitation of the reproducibility studies was the lack of blinding of observers, leading to an uncertain risk of bias for work ﬂow, index and reference values. Moving forward, we urgently need prospective, blinded comparison studies in AF patients, with imaging not restricted to participants with high quality images. Only with this knowledge can we be certain that measurements derived from cardiac imaging truly reﬂect underlying systolic function in patients with AF.
