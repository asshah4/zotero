abstract
Aims: There is increasing interest in using fructosamine measurements in screening for or managing diabetes, yet uncertainty remains as to whether these measurements should be corrected for variation in serum protein concentrations.
Methods: We considered all sets of simultaneous measurements of fructosamine, albumin, total serum protein (TP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1C recorded in our laboratory over 10 years. The relationships between fructosamine and other variables were studied by multivariate linear regression and other analyses, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) were analysed to compare the diabetes screening performance of uncorrected fructosamine to those of albumin-corrected fructosamine (FAAlb) and TP-corrected fructosamine (FATP).
Results: 40,938 sets of measurements were collected from 20,114 patients. Though correlation between fructosamine and serum proteins was strongest among patients with HbA1C b6.5% (48 mmol/mol), it was also signiﬁcant in the whole sample (r = 0.193 for albumin, r = 0.213 for TP). With diabetes deﬁned by HbA1C ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol), the areas under the ROCs of FAAlb (0.905) and FATP (0.895) were both signiﬁcantly greater (P b 0.001) than that of uncorrected fructosamine (0.878). Correction of fructosamine for albumin or TP slightly improved its correlation with HbA1C. There was no correlation of protein (albumin or TP) with log(fructosamine/ protein).
Conclusions: Fructosamine concentration correlates signiﬁcantly with albumin and total protein concentrations throughout their ranges. Correction of fructosamine improves its correlation with HbA1C and its performance in detecting diabetes.

1. Introduction
In the management of established diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) is the reference biomarker of control of glycemia. Recent advances in measurement standardization have led to its also being able to play a diagnostic role [1]. It nevertheless has its limitations. To begin with, HbA1C levels are affected by a variety of genetic, hematological and disease-related factors: low levels are typical of later-stage chronic kidney disease, certain hemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell

disease and thalassemia), and conditions that shorten the lifespan of the erythrocyte (e.g. hemolytic anemia and spherocytosis) [2–4]; and high levels have been associated with iron deﬁciency and other conditions with decreased erythrocyte turnover [5]). HbA1C levels are also difﬁcult to interpret in the context of gestational diabetes. More generally, the fact that HbA1C integrates glycemia over the lifespan of the erythrocyte means that it is relatively insensitive to shorter-term changes such as may be of interest for monitoring the effects of changes in therapy [6–7].
The above limitations of HbA1C as a measure of glycemic control imply that there are niches for other biomarkers that could be used when HbA1C cannot, because they do not suffer the corresponding limitation. Particular interest has focused on fructosamine (total glycated serum protein) and glycated serum albumin (GA), which reﬂect glycemia in the past 2–4 weeks and do not depend on hemoglobin metabolism. Recently, a cross-sectional analysis found both these analytes to be at least as strongly associated with microvascular complications of diabetes as HbA1C is [9]; and a study of 2314 type 2 diabetes patients followed up for an average 6.5 years found the risk of progression of

nephropathy to increase with the updated mean fructosamine level, with a hazard ratio slightly greater than that of updated mean HbA1C [10].
To circumvent the inﬂuence of variation in serum albumin levels, GA is used clinically as the ratio of glycated to total serum albumin [8–9,11]. Also, the standardised reference method for measuring HbA1c promotes a standardized unit, millimoles of HbA1c per mole of Hb, which avoid ﬂuctuation in blood hemoglobin levels [12]. By contrast, best practice for fructosamine in this respect is uncertain, controversy over whether measurements should be corrected for total albumin, total protein, or neither never having been resolved [13]. The study described here was undertaken to clarify whether fructosamine measurements obtained by a high-speciﬁcity enzymatic method should be corrected or not, and if so, with respect to albumin or total protein.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Data
A proﬁle was deﬁned as comprising measurements of fructosamine, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1C, albumin and total serum protein in blood samples from a single patient obtained at a single visit. Included in the study were all the complete proﬁles from diabetic and nondiabetic outpatients that were obtained and recorded in the clinical biochemistry laboratory of the University Hospital Complex, Santiago de Compostela (Spain) between March 2004 and March 2014. These proﬁles were divided in three groups according to whether the samples of origin were from a) patients with established type 1 or b) type 2 diabetes; c) patients with prediabetes, i.e. with FPG levels of 100– 125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) and/or HbA1C levels of 5.7–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol) [1]; or d) normoglycemic patients with FPG levels below 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and HbA1C levels b 5.7% (b 39 mmol/mol).
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and data management was approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from every patient prior to their inclusion in this or previous studies.

Glucose, albumin and total protein concentrations were determined on Advia Analyzer using kits from Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. Globulin was calculated as total protein minus albumin.
2.3. Statistical analysis
The statistical signiﬁcance of differences between groups was estimated by Student's t-test if the corresponding distributions were normal or by Wilcoxon's test otherwise. Correlations were evaluated as Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient in the case of bivariate normal distributions or as Spearman's correlation coefﬁcient otherwise. Normality was assessed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests.
Within each of four HbA1C ranges (b 5.7% (b 39 mmol/mol), 5.7–7.0% (39–53 mmol/mol), 7.1–9.0% (54–75 mmol/mol), and N 9.0% (N75 mmol/mol)), mean FA values in albumin interquintile intervals were compared by ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons if the groups were normally distributed, or by Kruskal-Wallis tests otherwise; and a parallel analysis was performed for FAAlb. The relative impacts of albumin, globulins and FPG on FA were evaluated by multivariate linear regression as their standardized regression coefﬁcients (z values, i.e. the regression coefﬁcients divided by their SEs).
Optimal FA, FAAlb and FATP thresholds for detection of diabetes (deﬁned for this purpose by HbA1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)) were obtained from receiver operating characteristics (ROCs), the corresponding diagnostic sensitivities and speciﬁcities were calculated, and a parallel analysis was performed for diabetes deﬁned by FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). The statistical signiﬁcance of differences between areas under ROCs (AUCs) was estimated by the test of DeLong et al. [16]. P values b0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. All calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0 or MedCalc 11.1.
To verify if there is any relationship of dependence between FA and albumin, we used the speciﬁc glycation index suggested by Schleicher er al. (17), This index is given as log (FA/serum Albumine) and they demostrated it should be indirectaly proportional to serum albumin concentration itself.

2.2. Analytical methods

3. Results

Whole blood for determination of HbA1C was collected in EDTAcontaining tubes. HbA1C, FPG and serum fructosamine, albumin and total protein were all determined on the day of collection.
HbA1C was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography as implemented by Menarini Diagnostics HA-8121 and HA-8140 analyzers. The interassay coefﬁcient of variation (CV) was 1.6% at an HbA1C level of 5.9% (41 mmol/mol), and 0.9% at an HbA1C level of 11% (97 mmol/mol). For this study, all HbA1C values were converted from JDS/JSCC-referenced values (JDS = Japanese Diabetes Society; JSCC = Japanese Society for Clinical Chemistry) to DCCT-aligned units [14].
Fructosamine was determined by the GlyPro enzymatic method (Genzyme, Kent, UK) on a Cobas Mira analyzer (Roche). This assay uses proteinase K to digest serum proteins into small fragments, and ketoamine oxidase to catalyse the speciﬁc oxidation of the ketoamine bond of glycated fragments; the release of hydrogen peroxide, measured colorimetrically at 550 nm, is proportional to the concentration of fructosamine. The interassay CV was 1.8% at fructosamine = 175 μmol/L and 0.91% at 640 μmol/L. Fructosamine values were used either uncorrected (FA), or corrected for albumin or total protein concentration (respectively FAAlb and FATP) as per Lin et al. [15]:

The mean serum concentrations of albumin and total protein in the whole data set being 42 and 70 g/L, respectively.

The data set comprised 40,938 sets of measurements from 20,114 patients (Table 1). Consideration of FA levels in patient groups deﬁned by the quintiles of the distribution of albumin concentrations (Fig. 1) might suggest, in keeping with early studies [18], that FA only depends on albumin at below-normal albumin levels: mean FA in the group with lowest albumin levels, 226 μmol/L, was signiﬁcantly less (P b 0.001) than in the other groups (276–289 μmol/L), which did not differ significantly from each other in mean FA. However, this analysis ignores the dependence of FA on glycemia, variation of which among the albumin interquintile groups is shown by the existence of signiﬁcant differences among their mean FPG and HbA1C values (P b 0.001). The mean (SD) of FPG values in each interquintile of albumin were 147 (75); 147 (66); 156 (68); 148 (66) and 135 (55), with all of them expressed in mg/dL, while for HbA1c were 7.0 (2.2); 7.0 (1.8); 7.3 (1.8); 6.9 (1.7) and 6.4 (1.4) with all values expressed as percentages. FA in fact exhibited signiﬁcant albeit weak correlation with albumin in the whole sample (r = 0.193), although correlation was much stronger among patients who were nondiabetic (r = 0.452) or pre-diabetic (r = 0.433) than among those with diabetes (r = 0.177–0.196) (Table 2).
A similar pattern was shown by correlation between FA and total protein (r = 0.213 in the whole sample), although the inﬂuence of globulins on FA (r = 0.067–0.123) was between 3 and 16 times smaller than that of albumin in the various patient subgroups. Contrariwise, correlation between FA and other measures of glycemia (FPG and HbA1C) was much stronger among patients with diabetes than among those without (Table 2). Thus although variation in FA was determined predominantly by variation in glycemia in the diabetic range, and by variation in

albumin among nondiabetic patients, it was never totally independent of either albumin or glycemia.
The universal inﬂuence of albumin is further supported by the data of Fig. 2a, which shows values of FA for albumin interquintiles within each of four HbA1C ranges. For all HbA1C ranges b 9% (75 mmol/mol), FA increased signiﬁcantly (P b 0.001) between successive albumin interquintiles. That among patients with HbA1C N 9% the increases in mean FA between the second and third albumin interquintiles, and between the third and fourth, were not statistically signiﬁcant, is attributable to the wide variation of HbA1C in this group, 9–18% (71–173 mmol/mol); the overall increasing trend was signiﬁcant (P b 0.001), as in the other HbA1C groups. Similar results were obtained when, within these same HbA1C ranges, the trend in FA among groups deﬁned by total protein quintiles was compared with the trend in FATP, the main difference being that FATP showed a greater tendency than FAAlb to peak in the central interquintiles (results not shown).
Pursuing further the same reasoning as prompted the analysis of Fig. 2, Table 3 lists the results of multivariate regression of FA on albumin, globulins and FPG in each of three different HbA1C ranges. The

ratio between the inﬂuence of FPG on FA and that of albumin is seen to be about 52% among nondiabetic patients (HbA1C b 5.7%; 39 mmol/mol), about 73% among prediabetic patients (HbA1C 5.7–6.4%; 39–46 mmol/mol), and about 209% among patients with diabetes (HbA1C ≥6.5%; 48 mmol/mol).
In all except the highest of the HbA1C ranges considered in Fig. 2, emendment of FA as FAAlb successfully eliminated positive correlation with albumin (Fig. 2b). In the exceptional range HbA1C N 9% 75 mmol/mol, emendment introduced negative correlation of borderline signiﬁcance, probably in great measure because in this less homogeneous group (vide supra) the subgroup of patients with albumin levels
below the ﬁrst quintile had a higher mean HbA1C than the other albumin interquintile groups.
In the whole sample, emendment as FAAlb improved correlation with both HbA1C (r increasing from 0.779 to 0.807; Fig. 3a and b) and FPG (r increasing from 0.604 to 0.618), while correction as FATP achieved similar but smaller improvements (r = 0.799 for correlation with HbA1C and r = 0.610 for FPG).
To investigate the extent to which correction for albumin or total pro-
tein might improve the performance of fructosamine in screening for diabetes, the set of ﬁrst proﬁles obtained from the 20,114 patients was used to construct ROC curves for detection, by FA, FAAlb and FATP, of diabetes deﬁned by HbA1C ≥6.5%; 48 mmol/mol (Fig. 4a) or by FPG ≥126 mg/dL; 7.0 mmol/L (Fig. 4b). With diabetes deﬁned by HbA1C, the various measures of fructosamine were ranked by their AUCs in the order FAAlb (AUC = 0.905)N FATP (0.895)N FA (0.878) (P b 0.001 for comparison of FA with either of the others). The optimal diagnostic thresholds were
FAAlb = 241 μmol/L (diagnostic sensitivity 80.7%, diagnostic speciﬁcity 89.7%), FATP = 247 μmol/L (sensitivity 77.6%, speciﬁcity 89.3%) and FA = 246 μmol/L (sensitivity 74.8%, speciﬁcity 89.2%). With diabetes deﬁned by FPG, the AUC-based ranking was the same - FAAlb (0.834)NFATP (0.826)N FA (0.816) (P b 0.001 for both FA vs. FAAlb and FA vs. FATP) and the optimal diagnostic thresholds were FAAlb = 234 μmol/L (sensitivity 72.8%, speciﬁcity 82.2%), FATP = 237 μmol/L (sensitivity 71.3%, speciﬁcity 82.3%) and FA = 233 μmol/L (sensitivity 71.4%, speciﬁcity 81.3%).
Finally, we investigated whether albumin correlated better with speciﬁc glycation, given as log(fructosamine/albumin) (=log FAAlb–log 42) than with corrected or uncorrected fructosamine, as was reported by

Schleicher et al. [17]. To minimize distortion due to the inﬂuence of glycemia on fructosamine levels, the whole population of participants with HbA1C between 5 (31 mmol/mol) and 10% (86 mmol/mol) was divided in HbA1C classes 0.5% wide (5.0–5.4%, 5.5–5.9%, etc.), but in none of these groups was there signiﬁcant correlation between albumin and log(fructosamine/albumin), r ranging from −0.017 to 0.051. By contrast, in the whole sample log(fructosamine/albumin) was closely correlated with both fructosamine (r = 0.939) and HbA1C (r = 0.784) (P b 0.0001 in both cases).
4. Discussion
In this study we measured fructosamine with a high-speciﬁcity enzymatic assay in large samples of diabetic, prediabetic and nondiabetic patients. The good correlation with HbA1C suggests that in general the participants had stable glycemia when their analytical proﬁles were obtained. Our results clearly show that fructosamine concentrations are affected by differences in serum protein concentrations over the whole range of the latter and at all levels of glycemia. Although the effect is small, especially among patients with normal or high albumin levels, correcting fructosamine measurements for albumin or total protein improves both correlation with HbA1C and diagnostic performance in the detection of diabetes deﬁned by HbA1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or FPG N126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). The ﬁnding that the inﬂuence of serum albumin on fructosamine levels is four or ﬁve times that of globulin is in keeping with albumin being far more abundant (it makes up 50–60% of plasma protein in normal individuals [19], and representing more than 80% of the total molecules), and with the modest difference between correction for albumin and correction for total protein as regards correlation with HbA1C and diagnostic performance.
It has been argued that fructosamine levels should not depend on serum protein concentration, because the latter (or more exactly, the concentration of lysine residues susceptible to glycation) is always

vastly in excess of the reactive open-chain form of glucose [20]. The observation that fructosamine levels do in fact depend on serum protein may be due to the pool of open-chain glucose being constantly replenished by isomerization of the cyclic form [21]. It has also been argued that fructosamine levels should not depend on serum albumin concentration – or at least, should not be corrected for serum albumin concentration – because although a higher albumin concentration may increase the glycation rate it is also accompanied by a reduction in the half-life of albumin [17]. Schleicher et al. supported this contention with the observation of good negative correlation between albumin and log(fructosamine/albumin) among 63 nondiabetic subjects with serum albumin levels of 17–48 g/L [17]. In the present study log(fructosamine/albumin) exhibited no correlation with albumin at any HbA1C level, and in the whole study group exhibited close correlation with fructosamine and HbA1C. These latter correlations are in keeping with the analysis of Schleicher et al. – that they were not observed by Schleicher et al. themselves is attributable to their using a small group of patients with a limited range of non-diabetic HbA1C values. The discrepancy concerning correlation between albumin and log(fructosamine/albumin) is more intriguing, but again seems likely to derive from the difference in study size.
While at least one previous study found no correlation at all between serum protein and fructosamine levels [22], in a number of others, as in ours, such correlation has been observed [23–26]. Although the inﬂuence of serum proteins was in all these cases greatest at sub-normal levels, it was not limited to this range as has been claimed by others [27–29]. The discrepancies among these and other results (most of them obtained 15 years or more ago) may be due to a number of factors. They include small study size [17,23,25,29,30] and differences in the composition of the study group, which has variously consisted of Maoris [31], normal children [29], individuals with diabetes [25], individuals without diabetes [17,23,29–31], or mixes with various proportions of participants with and without diabetes [22,30,32,33]. Additionally, all these earlier studies determined fructosamine concentrations by nonenzymatic methods – most of them by the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay, which suffers from interference (amounting to about half the fructosamine concentration in healthy persons) due to a nonspeciﬁc reducing activity of NBT in serum [18,34]. The present study, though limited geographically to the population served by a single tertiary hospital laboratory, included 40,938 analytical proﬁles from 20,114 participants, and employed a highly speciﬁc enzymatic method for the determination of fructosamine. We emphasize, moreover, that the study group was not only large, but was also not limited to diabetic patients or to diabetic patients plus an arbitrary number of nondiabetic individuals: it comprised all patients for whom the relevant proﬁle had been requested in the past 10 years, and was therefore truly representative of the population

for whom the issue of whether or not to correct for serum protein is pertinent.
A limitation of this study is the absence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, which prevents evaluation of whether correction of fructosamine for albumin or total protein improves correlation with CGM-derived measures of glycemia as it does correlation with HbA1C and FPG. Finally, it is interesting that the improvements in correlation with HbA1C and in diagnostic performance upon correction for albumin were not only similar to those achieved by correcting for total protein – a similarity attributable to the much smaller inﬂuence of globulins on fructosamine (see Table 2) – but were in both cases greater than when FATP was used. This may perhaps be due to possible heterogeneity among globulins as regards susceptibility to glycation.
In conclusion, in this study we found that serum fructosamine concentration is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by serum protein concentration, not only when serum concentration is low but throughout its entire range. Correcting fructosamine for albumin or total protein improves its correlation with HbA1C and FPG, and slightly but signiﬁcantly increases its ability to predict that HbA1C exceeds 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or FPG 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Though the correction is slight for most patients, we recommend its application, which in the vast majority of cases will involve no extra cost, requests for fructosamine determination invariably being accompanied by a routine request for albumin determination and which is the best for patients care.
