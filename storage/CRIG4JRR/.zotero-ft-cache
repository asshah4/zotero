opinion. One thing to be insisted ujon is that in each of these degrees there is a negative, an(d that there is a positive, and often b
superpositive, eleIIment. 'We inust bewvare of the ordinary no`en01n-;
ture; (post) epileptic mania is named after the positive eleenit onily; (post) epileptic coma is named after the negative element only. Negatively, there are increasing degrees froin defect, through so-called lost of consciousness, to coma, signifying three increasing depths of disso, lution ; positively, there are decreasing degrees from ideation thriegh elaborate actionls to mllere- vital operatiolls, signifying three increasingly

[The first depth -was then remarked on. The i(deation or dreamy state" was usually called an intellectual allra, andl was, by imost 'physcians considered to he part of the paroxysm. Particular attention wag drawn to the frequent occuirrenice of the "dreamy statq," W'ith or: after movements of chewNing, or tasting, anid sometimes of spittiR"gmoveements believed to imply an excitation of central gustatory 'ele-
ments.]

The range of exhaustion downwards will vary according to the severity of the discharge ; we must bear in mind also another factor governing range, that the lower the centre the more organised it is, and thus
that it will resist more and recuperate sooiler. I neglect the impli-
cation of the lower centres. Now, manifestly, returning to the case of epileptic mania, exhaus-
tion of the highest two layers of the highest centres being a purelv negative state cannot account for the superpositive state, mania. Nothing cannot be the cause of something. I repeat, that the maniacal actions are supposed to be the outcome of the activity, on the
lower-level of evolution remaining-third layer-of nervous arrange-
ments which, except for over-physiological activity, are healthy; that they are manifestations of the survival of the fittest states on the lower, but then highest, level of evolution. To show more particu-
larly what is meant, we must speak of three degrees of exhaustion, three increasing depths of dissolution, which are effected by epileptic
discharges-ofdifferent degrees ofseverity, taking count of the corres-

The doctrine of evolution implies the passage from the most organ- patient's immobility down to the negative physical change in his ised to the least organised, or, in other terms, from the most general nervous centres-to attribute the physical to the physical-than to the to the most special. Roughly, we say that there is a gradual "adding correlative negative mental state. In other words, I give a realistic on" of the more and more special, a continual adding on of new organ- explanation in place of a metaphysical one. I put this question, "If isations. But this "addinig on" is at the same time a "keeping loss of consciousness were all, why should not the patient move as

keep down those lower, just as a government evolved out of a nation to the majority of medical men, for, as I have pointed out, they posi-

controls as well as directs that nation. If this be the process of evo-
lution, then the reverse process of dissolution is not onily " a taking off " of the higher, but is at the very same time a " letting go " of the lower. If the governing body of this country were destroyed suddenly,
we should have two causes for lamentation: 1, The loss of services of

Let us look at two comparable sets of facts. If a man does not move his

In other words, the lower level of evolution is not at all. Let us consider a greater range of cases from another "goaded into activity," but is "let go." So we see that exhaustion of point of view; I dwell upon this matter because it seems to me to be

We stay to remark on some differences in the two depths. One After a slight attack of epilepsy (le petit ovwl), the patient declares

to be a question of importance, and of more practical importance than, at first glance, appears, whether or not in the second depth there is some ideation, in spite of the expression " loss of consciousness." That there is activity of some nervous arrangements of the highest centres, we are supposing of the third layer, is, I submit, quite certain. The question is this: "Do states of consciousness attend that activity or not? There will be two views on this matter. Let me return to the case of the fisherman, who pantomimically pulled out a line from the reel, etc., when " unconscious" after an attack. Had that man, who, on recovery, remembered nothing of his doings,
any states of consciousness attending the nervous activities which
were producing his elaborate actions? One view would be that the fact that the patient remembered nothing was proof that there were
no mental states. Another view would be that the very elaborateness
of the operation implied some co-existing states of consciousness. We

severe fit, and if after it he does not move any way (except for " vital" movements), then his inmmobility is explained metaphysically. In the simple case instanced of paralysis of one leg after an epileptiform seizure, the patient is declared to be paralysed. So that of the first a popular explanation is given ; but, I would ask, what is " weakness " after an excessive nervous discharge but paralysis? Of
the second a metaphysical explanation is given; but I contend that
there is no reason why a patient should not move if loss of consciousness were all ; it is not all. Of the third only is a thoroughly realistic
explanatioii given. Are we to believe that local immnobility after a

he is unconscious. This, I submit, is a metaphysical explanation.

We want, in scientific matters, realistic explanations. My belief is

that the postepileptic immobility is paralysis. The objection which

epileptic mania exhaustion of two layers also entails some, if less, paralysis. You are bound to say that the epileptic mania has some uiniversal paralysis, although at the very same time he is in a state of universal activity." Of course, I do not endorse the absurdity that a man is perfectly paralysed all over, and that at the same time he is in movenment all over. My contention simply is, that in post-epileptic mania there is some degree of paralysis all over the body, or, more precisely, loss of some movements of all parts, and that at the very same time there is persistence and over developmont of some other movements of all parts. To show that this is not an extravagance, I would point out that loss of moveinents of the whole of a part, with persistence of some other movemnents of the whole of that part, is an exceedingly common thing.
