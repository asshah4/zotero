Abstract Objective: Fluid responsiveness is the ability to increase the cardiac output in response to a fluid challenge. Only about 50% of patients receiving fluid resuscitation for acute circulatory failure increase their stroke volume, but the other 50% may worsen their outcome. Therefore, predicting fluid responsiveness is needed. In this purpose, in recent years, the assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) through ultrasound (US) has become very popular. The aim of our work was to systematically review all the previously published studies assessing the accuracy of the diameter of IVC or its respiratory variations measured through US in predicting fluid responsiveness. Data Sources: We searched in the MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science databases for all relevant articles from inception to September 2017. Study Selection: Included articles specifically addressed the accuracy of IVC diameter or its respiratory variations assessed by US in predicting the fluid responsiveness in critically ill ventilated or not, adult or pediatric patients. Data Extraction: We included 26 studies that investigated the role of the caval index (IVC collapsibility or distensibility) and 5 studies on IVC diameter. Data Synthesis: We conducted a meta-analysis for caval index with 20 studies: The pooled area under the curve, logarithmic diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.83), 2.02 (95% CI: 1.29-2.89), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.80), and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64-0.85), respectively. Conclusion: An extreme heterogeneity of included studies was highlighted. Ultrasound evaluation of the diameter of the IVC and its respiratory variations does not seem to be a reliable method to predict fluid responsiveness.

Introduction
In critically ill patients demonstrating an absolute or relative reduction in circulating volume (for sepsis, acute blood loss, anaphylaxis, etc), increased cardiac output (CO) to improve tissue perfusion is essential. However, gathered evidence shows excessive fluid administration may result in a worst outcome, through pulmonary or peripheral edema, compartmental syndrome, and reduced oxygen diffusion. Unfortunately, clinical evaluation alone is not able to distinguish which patients will benefit from an increase in intravenous fluids and which patients may instead worsen.1-4
Cardiac output is the product of systolic output and heart rate. Within certain boundaries, the relationship between preload and CO is described by Frank-Starling curve. When the hemodynamic system exceeds the maximum slope of the curve, an increase in preload does not correspond to an equal increase in stroke volume. The speed at which this flat part of the Frank-Starling curve is reached depends on cardiac contractility and afterload.1-4

A hemodynamically compromised patient is usually hypovolemic, but the responsiveness to fluid resuscitation is scarcely predictable. Only about 50% of patients receiving fluid resuscitation for acute circulatory failure increase their stroke volume (not only for preexisting cardiac conditions but also for acutely acquired dysfunctions such as sepsis-related cardiomyopathy),1 so it is essential to be able to accurately predict

the fluid responsiveness of our patient. Invasive methods, such as the Swan-Ganz catheter (able to directly measure capillary wedge pressure), and noninvasive methods, such as peripheral arterial pulse wave analysis, were developed. However, these methods are not completely capable to predict fluid responsiveness, especially in certain circumstances, such as arrhythmias or spontaneously breathing patients.5-9 Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) currently is probably the most used method to evaluate the fluid responsiveness. However, this tool can determine the effect of increase in circulating volume only once a fluid load has already been administered.10 For these reasons, besides the need of easy and ready-to-use methods also from nonhighly skilled staff, several methods that can potentially predict fluid responsiveness were studied.
In order to predict fluid responsiveness, one of the most popular methods is assessing the diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) or its respiratory variation through ultrasound (US). In spontaneously breathing patients, the IVC diameter decreases due to the increase in the thoracic volume which reduces the intrathoracic pressure. This collapsibility effect may be indexed, dividing the difference of the 2 diameters for the maximum diameter (inferior vena cava collapsibility). This measure is called “caval index.” In mechanically ventilated patients, the inspiratory flow is administered by the ventilator and is therefore at a positive pressure. The increase in the intrathoracic pressure causes a distension of the IVC, the meaning of which is similar to the caval index (inferior vena cava distensibility).
The aim of our study was to systematically review all previously published studies that evaluated the accuracy of the IVC diameter or its respiratory variations assessed through US in predicting fluid responsiveness.
Methods
Searching Strategy and Study Selection
We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to September 2017. The searched item consisted of terms related to volume status (including “fluid,” “volume,” and “fluid responsiveness”), “inferior vena cava,” and “ultrasound.” We searched also citations of relevant primary and review articles. Conference abstracts, review articles, non-English studies, nonhuman studies, protocols or policy statement, and guidelines were excluded. We included studies considering a wide type of adult and pediatric patients (eg, from sepsis to subarachnoid hemorrhage). Studies involving both mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients were included. Studies in any hospital departments or setting were included.
We considered the studies on IVC diameter and/or collapsibility/distensibility of IVC measured by US. We included studies reporting any measure to define the fluid responsiveness (stroke index, CO, cardiac index, etc); we considered studies using TTE, transpulmonary thermodilution, bioreactance (BR), and any other techniques as standard references.

We are aware that not all standard references are equally accurate, but we took this issue into account in the qualitative assessment of the included studies.
Critical Appraisal
Two independent reviewers (D.O. and I.P.) read all papers and scored them according to the QUADAS2 checklist.11 Any disagreement was discussed. If no agreement was reached even after discussion, a third person (T.P.) was involved. A criterion by majority was adopted. In the systematic review, we considered all relevant studies that passed quality selection. In the meta-analysis, we considered only the studies which declared sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence of fluid responsiveness.
Data Extraction and Data Synthesis
Data about type of study; publication year; target population; setting; ventilation mode; eventual tidal volume; fluid challenge content and volume; standard reference device, measurement, and threshold; IVC detection method; index test threshold; and prevalence of fluid responsiveness were extracted from studies.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the R-CRAN project version 3.4.0 (R Core Team [2017]. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL: https://www.Rproject.org/). The R packages “meta4diag” and “INLA” were implemented. Quantitative variables were expressed as median and 95% confidence interval (CI). Due to the threshold effect, we did not consider appropriate using I2 as heterogeneity measurement. Knowing the high level of heterogeneity a priori, we used summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and funnel plot to identify the degree of heterogeneity. For construing SROC curve, we used a Bayesian inference method using integrated nested Laplace approximations for bivariate meta-analysis.12-16 We implemented a hierarchical approach through the model of Rutter and Gatsonis.17 We investigated heterogeneity through subanalyses of the setting in which the studies were conducted, the type of study population, the ventilation mode, and the adopted standard reference.
Results Search Strategy Findings
Five hundred one articles were found through systematic search; 426 articles were excluded because they were duplicated (63), they did not meet inclusion criteria or with different end points (141), or were abstracts, case reports or letters (88), reviews (85), protocols, guidelines or policy statements (41), written in another language than English (6), or bibliographies (2). The selection process is described in Figure 1.

On the basis of the included studies, we were able to achieve a meta-analysis of 20 studies18-22,24-35,41-42,44 that evaluated the caval index. Due to the extreme heterogeneity and the small number of studies evaluating the IVC diameter, we did not conduct a meta-analysis for this index test.

Description of Included Studies
Regarding caval index studies, we considered 1709 cases. Only 1 study was multicentric. Eighteen studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs), 5 in operating rooms (ORs), and 3 in emergency departments (EDs). Twenty-two studies involved adult patients and 4 studies pediatric patients. Regarding the target populations, 8 studies enrolled patients with sepsis, 4 studies surgical patients, 3 studies patients with cardiac diseases, 8 studies mixed patients (the remaining studies involved neurosurgical patients, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, or patients with severe preeclampsia). Regarding the ventilation mode, 16 studies considered mechanically ventilated patients and 7 spontaneously breathing patients (3 studies did not declared this item). Most common tidal volumes were between 8 and 10 mL/kg/min. The most commonly used reference method was TTE (16 studies). Two studies considered transesophageal echocardiography, 2 studies BR method, 2 studies Vigileo, 2 studies pulse index continuous cardiac output, and 1 study noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement. Eight studies considered the cardiac index as standard reference, 5 studies CO, 8 studies stroke volume (SVi), 3 studies velocity time integral (VTI), 1 study stroke volume variation, and 1 study systolic blood pressure (SBP; Table 1).
Regarding IVC diameter studies, the pooled sample was 268 patients. All studies were conducted in ICUs. All studies involved adult patients. Two studies involved patients with sepsis, and the others considered cardiac, trauma, or mixed patients. Two studies were conducted on mechanically ventilated patients and 3 on spontaneously breathing patients. The most used standard reference method was TTE, and 1 study used BP. In 3 studies, standard reference measure was CO, in 1 was SVi, and in 1 was SBP (Table 2).

Figure 1. Flow diagram of literature search and study selection.
Of 75 studies considered for the intended purpose, 48 studies were discarded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (12), were reviews or meta-analysis (6), were letters (1) considered alternative end points (19), were protocols or did not summarize the statistical results, (8) or because of questionable methodological quality (2).
Finally, 27 studies were included: 22 were related to the caval index,18-39 1 study was related to the IVC diameter,40 and 4 studies evaluated both indexes41-44 (Tables 1 and 2).

Risk of Bias
Most caval index studies were qualitatively high, but some risks of bias were found in patient selection (selection of cardiac, surgical, or other categories of patients is a possible source of heterogeneity), flow and timing (some studies did not declare the delay between fluid administration and IVC evaluation), and the choice of standard reference. The high degree of heterogeneity was also revealed by funnel plot (Figure 2). A very disaggregated distribution of studies, particularly those with wider samples (which are far from the expected logarithmic diagnostic odds ratio [LDOR] average), was detected. There was not a clear publication bias, but studies with the largest sample size were extremely heterogeneous in their results.

The quality of the IVC diameter studies was quite high. One study used SBP as standard reference: This choice was considered a high risk of bias and the applicability of the obtained results was rather uncertain (Tables 3 and 4).

Standard deviation is plotted on the vertical axis. The effects estimated by smaller studies spread lower on the bottom; larger studies are distributed along the narrower, triangular upper part.

Results of Meta-Analysis
Regarding caval index studies, the sensitivity ranged from 0.39 (95% CI: 0.23-0.57) to 0.86 (95% CI: 0.71-0.95) and the specificity ranged from 0.28 (95% CI: 0.18-0.41) to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72-0.99). Logarithmic diagnostic odds ratio ranged from À0.10 (95% CI: À1.07 to 0.86) to 3.61 (95% CI: 2.03-5.32). The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and LDOR were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.63-0.80), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64-0.84), and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.29-2.83; Figures 3 and 4; Figure 7 in Supplemental Digital Content), respectively. The pooled area under the curve was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.46-0.83; marginal likelihood ratio ¼ À125.41; Figure 5).
By dividing the pooled sample on the basis of the considered populations (adults vs pediatric patients), the sensitivity, specificity, and LDOR of the studies on adults were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.80), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64-0.85), and 2.04 (95% CI: 1.262.89), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and LDOR of the studies on pediatric populations were 0.74 (95% CI: 0.440.92), 0.68 (95% CI: 0.27-0.92), and 1.81 (95% CI: À0.60 to 4.28), respectively.

Discussion
The evaluation of the IVC diameter or the caval index seems to be a well-studied method. Nevertheless, extremely discordant results were obtained in the literature. Long and colleagues, in their meta-analysis, found a remarkable degree of heterogeneity.4 Even if we did not find a relevant difference in the diagnostic accuracy of the caval index in predicting fluid responsiveness among studies enrolling adult or pediatric populations, there are still few studies in the literature investigating the role of IVC in pediatric populations. Gan et al found only 2 studies in this regard, with contrasting results.45 Only 2 of 4 studies on the pediatric population could be included in our meta-analysis. Drawing conclusions from these small populations and from very different studies each other is very difficult.
The caval index seemed to gain greater accuracy in ED and OR studies than ICU studies.46 In particular, a greater sensitivity of the caval index in ED studies than ICU ones was

observed. It is difficult to understand how much this result is linked to real clinical conditions of clearly different populations or it is the result of transient effects not observed in ICU.
Compared to patients with sepsis, in surgical patients, the caval index shown a different accuracy, in particular a lower specificity. Although surgical patients are often hypovolemic, surgical interventions or conditions that increase intraabdominal pressure can make the caval index unreliable.47-49
In contrast to the literature, we found a lower predictive ability of the caval index in ventilated patients than those in spontaneously breathing.4,50 It is difficult to understand how much this is related to real clinical differences or methodological bias. In fact, the ventilatory parameters collected from the studies were not so different such as to explain this very heterogeneous result. A possible explanation may be that changes in IVC diameter in ventilated patients are less extensive and therefore more subject to approximation errors, compared to the spontaneously breathing patients.
The lack of a real gold standard is responsible for a consistent part of heterogeneity: In our analysis, nonindexed measures (eg, VTI, CO) seem to be more subject to a broad variability (wider CIs). This is reasonable considering the anthropometric variations associated with each patient. Also, small errors in transvalvular flow sampling can cause major errors in the final result. Ansari et al noted there is no

substantial agreement in the literature on the definition of “fluid responsiveness.” Parameters such as “precision” and “reproducibility” of a measurement do not seem to be sufficiently explicated in fluid responsiveness studies.1 Moreover, any monitoring system has limitations related to the clinical condition of the patient, which reduces its applicability to any patient indiscriminately. In addition to this bias source, the accuracy with which measurements are made, especially in chaotic environments, is not always optimal. Ultimately, a number of minor approximations can lead to a major final error, especially when the parameters to be measured relate to critical patients requiring nearly immediate assistance.
Intra- and interobserver variability can contribute to overall heterogeneity. Only 5 studies clearly indicated the intra- and interobserver agreements. These ranged from 1.4% to 9% and from 3% to 6%, respectively.
Finally, the continuous nature of the considered variables— that were transformed into dichotomous variables in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy by SROC curve—could be a source of heterogeneity. As reported by several papers, probably there is an area of overlapping between responders and nonresponders, the so-called “gray zone” that is difficult to evaluate in a dichotomous manner.1,4,32
Compared to the meta-analyses reported in the literature,4,50,51 our study revealed a high degree of heterogeneity.

All the factors analyzed so far contribute to this result. Probably, there is no “one size fits all” method able to adapt to all critically ill patients indiscriminately. It is necessary not only to know the benefits of different hemodynamic monitoring methods but also their limitations in each setting and for each clinical condition. In other words, clinicians must select the right test for the right patient at the right time.
For the high heterogeneity, we found the cumulative final considerations in our study may not be totally reliable, although we used robust statistical methods (in particular a Bayesian method through a hierarchical approach) to overcome this limitation.
Conclusions
In summary, the extreme heterogeneity of the studies considering the role of IVC to predict fluid responsiveness makes difficult to evaluate the usefulness of IVC diameter and the caval index assessed by US. For the obtained data so far, US evaluation of the diameter of the IVC and its respiratory variations does not seem to be a reliable method to predict the fluid responsiveness.
