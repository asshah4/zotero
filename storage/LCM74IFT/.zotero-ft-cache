Ion Channel Macromolecular Complexes in Cardiomyocytes: Roles in Sudden Cardiac Death
Hugues Abriel, Jean-Sébastien Rougier, José Jalife

Abstract: The movement of ions across specific channels embedded on the membrane of individual cardiomyocytes is
crucial for the generation and propagation of the cardiac electric impulse. Emerging evidence over the past 20 years strongly suggests that the normal electric function of the heart is the result of dynamic interactions of membrane ion channels working in an orchestrated fashion as part of complex molecular networks. Such networks work together with exquisite temporal precision to generate each action potential and contraction. Macromolecular complexes play crucial roles in transcription, translation, oligomerization, trafficking, membrane retention, glycosylation, post-translational modification, turnover, function, and degradation of all cardiac ion channels known to date. In addition, the accurate timing of each cardiac beat and contraction demands, a comparable precision on the assembly and organizations of sodium, calcium, and potassium channel complexes within specific subcellular microdomains, where physical proximity allows for prompt and efficient interaction. This review article, part of the Compendium on Sudden Cardiac Death, discusses the major issues related to the role of ion channel macromolecular assemblies in normal cardiac electric function and the mechanisms of arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. It provides an idea of how these issues are being addressed in the laboratory and in the clinic, which important questions remain unanswered, and what future research will be needed to improve knowledge and advance therapy.   (Circ Res. 2015;116:1971-1988.

Fundamental research conducted over the past 20 years has led to an explosion of knowledge on the genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate the function of cardiac

ion channels. One of the most important outcomes of such new understanding has been the realization that the traditional reductionist view that ionic currents are the expression of

distinct proteins that are fixed and function independently expressed on an intracellular or surface membrane is no longer tenable. An ion channel protein may encounter and interact with hundreds of other proteins during its lifespan, from biosynthesis until degradation. Such a complex regulation over time and space suggests an important plasticity for these protein complexes which is a major determinant of cardiomyocyte function, including excitability, excitation–contraction coupling, intercellular communication, and the pathogenesis of arrhythmias. This article is part of the Circulation Research Compendium on Sudden Cardiac Death. It reviews research on many of the currently known multicomponent assemblies formed by the main cardiac ion channels with their protein partners. It looks also at the possible role that such assemblies may have in the molecular underpinnings of the normal electric function of the cardiomyocyte and the mechanisms of complex cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). We are focusing on cis-interacting proteins, that is, within the same cell. Although there is emerging evidence for important roles of proteins, such as the β-subunits, of the voltage-gated sodium channels in transinteractions as cell-adhesion molecules,1 this aspect is not addressed in this review.

Ion Channel Macromolecular Complexes Macromolecular complexes consist of a handful to several thousand individual components, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, and perform a wide array of vital tasks in the cell.2 As such, they are essential to the proper functioning of all cellular processes, including metabolism, cell signaling, gene expression, trafficking, cell cycle regulation, and the formation of subcellular structures.3,4 In the cardiac myocyte, macromolecular complexes also play crucial roles in converting energy, generating and propagating electric signals, and mediating contractility, as well as intercellular communication.5,6 To achieve these functions, complex molecular networks work together with exquisite temporal precision to generate each AP and contraction. The accurate timing of the molecular events demands, in addition, a comparable precision on the location of each molecule within the cell. Indeed, molecular networks assemble and organize within specific subcellular microdomains, where physical proximity allows for prompt and efficient interaction.7 For example, Petitprez et al8 described 2 separate pools of (NaV1.5) sodium channels in ventricular cardiomyocytes. One subpopulation localizes at the lateral membrane of the myocytes, whereas the other localizes at the intercalated disc (ID), and a recent study has shown that NaV1.5 and potassium inward rectifier (Kir)2.1 colocalize at both the ID and the lateral membrane, which is important for mutual regulation and the control of cardiac excitability.9
Genetic Cardiac Channelopathies Genetic cardiac channelopathies were identified >20 years ago.10 As of today, >35 distinct genes encoding ion channel subunits or regulatory proteins are known to be linked to arrhythmogenic syndromes.11 The estimated prevalence of cardiac channelopathies in the general population remains however difficult to assess.12 Cardiac channelopathies are likely responsible for about half of sudden arrhythmic cardiac death cases.13 The most prevalent genetic disorder is the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is caused by mutation-induced decrease in repolarizing currents or by increase in depolarizing currents. The second most frequent cardiac channelopathy is Brugada syndrome (BrS).14 The molecular mechanisms underlying BrS are still matter of controversy.15 Other important but more recently described forms of inherited arrhythmias caused by channel dysfunction include catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,16 congenital short-QT syndrome,17,18 and mixed phenotypes.19
Sodium Channel Macromolecular Complexes
The main voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in cardiac myocytes is NaV1.5;20 it is encoded by the human gene SCN5A. NaV1.5 is a large pore-forming protein, also called α-subunit, with 2016 amino acids and of a molecular weight of ≈220 kDa (Figure 1). The NaV1.5 protein has been shown to assemble with small (≈30–40 kDa), single transmembrane segment proteins called β-subunits.21 Four of these β-subunits have been described in the human genome.21 The exact stoichiometry between the α- and β-subunits of the cardiac Na+ channels is not known. However, the brain α-subunit of the Na+ channels was copurified with 1 β1 and 1 β2-subunit suggesting a possible 1:2 α to β stoichiometry.22 Several hundreds of mutations in

SCN5A have been linked to cardiac arrhythmic disorders, such as the congenital and acquired LQTS, BrS, conduction slowing, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and dilated cardiomyopathy.23 This impressive list of allelic disorders underlines the crucial role of NaV1.5 in physiology and diseases.
NaV1.5 Interacting Proteins Na 1.5 interacts with and is regulated by a myriad of proteins6
V
hence forming macromolecular complexes (Figure 1). These different interacting proteins reside in specific subcellular regions of the cardiac myocytes, such as the lateral membrane domains or the ID, thus defining distinct pools of Na 1.5
V
channels coexisting in cardiac cells.24 Importantly, mutations in the genes coding for some of these partner proteins were found in patients with genetic cardiac channelopathies, for example, congenital LQTS and BrS.17 The proteins interacting with NaV1.5 may have different functions such as anchoring/ adaptor proteins involved in trafficking, targeting, and anchoring of the channel protein to specific membrane compartments; as enzymes interacting with and modifying the channel structure via post-translational modifications; and as proteins modulating the biophysical properties of NaV1.5 on binding. For further details see the recent review article.24
Among the proteins that have been proposed to be involved in targeting the NaV1.5 channel proteins to specific compartments, α1-syntrophin (Figure 2A) and the membraneassociated guanylate kinase protein, synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97), play crucial roles (Figure 1). Both proteins have PDZ (postsynaptic density protein [PSD95], Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor [Dlg1], and zonula occludens-1 protein [zo-1]) protein–protein interacting domains allowing the direct interaction with the 3 last C-terminal residues of Na 1.5 (serine–isoleucine–valine or SIV motif). Recent
V
studies using genetically modified mouse models indicated a role of the syntrophin–dystrophin macromolecular complex and the key role of the SIV motif in determining the density of Na 1.5 channels at the lateral membranes of myocytes
V
(Figure 3).25,26 Although the role of the SIV motif and SAP97 at the ID remains to be clarified, neither truncated channels (ΔSIV) nor the cardiac ablation of SAP97 were sufficient to perturb the expression of NaV1.5 at the ID of mouse cardiac

cells (Figure 2A and 2B).25,26 Two other distinct protein–protein interacting domains are well recognized in the C-terminal sequence of NaV1.5 (Figure 1)27: the IQ (isoleucine-glutamine calmoduline binding motif)-motif allowing specific interaction with calmodulin and the PY (proline-tyrosine protein-protein interaction motif)-motif, a domain found in membrane proteins permitting the binding of ubiquitin ligases of the Neural precursor cell Expressed, Developmentally Downregulated 4 (Nedd4)/Nedd4-like family.28 Although the structural details and roles of the interaction of calmodulin and Na 1.5 have
V
been controversial, a recent study29 suggested a model where calmodulin may be an essential molecular player in the transitions between the different channel states.29
Mutations in Genes Coding for NaV1.5 Channel– Interacting Proteins and Associated Disorders Among the long list of proteins interacting with Na 1.5
V
(Figure 1),30 mutations in the genes coding for 6 of them were reported in patients with altered electric function that may lead to SCD. Also important, >20 naturally occurring mutations have been described in the genes coding for the 4 β-voltagegated sodium channel subunits.31 These mutations were found in patients with SCD phenotypes, such as BrS, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome, and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. The molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes were diverse, but the majority of these β-subunit mutations reduced the NaV1.5-mediated INa.31

Gavillet et al32 demonstrated that NaV1.5 interacts with dystrophin via adaptor syntrophin proteins (see also Figure 2A).32 Similar to the binding with SAP97, this interaction is dependent on the last 3 residues (SIV) of the NaV1.5 protein. Two missense mutations in SNTA1, encoding α1-syntrophin, have been described in patients with congenital LQTS.33 The SNTA1 mutation, p.A390V, was reported to disrupt a

with syntrophin.33 The mutant syntrophin protein increased the late Na+ current, a finding that is consistent with the
LQTS phenotype. Increased nitrosylation of NaV1.5, when the mutant syntrophin was coexpressed in HEK293 cells was
observed. Further, the mutation SNTA1 p.A257G was found in 3 unrelated LQTS probands.34 Although no increase in the
late INa was observed with this variant, significant increase in peak INa and slowed fast inactivation resulted from the coexpression of this mutant syntrophin. The gene SNTA1 was
also found to be mutated in 8 cases of patients with SIDS and
these variants caused an increase of the NaV1.5-mediated

late INa which was inhibited by neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.34
Caveolin-3 Caveolin proteins are important components of caveolae, which are cholesterol-rich plasma membrane invaginations where signaling molecules and ion channels are enriched. Caveolin-3 (Cav3) is encoded by the gene CAV3; it is the predominant caveolin isoform expressed in cardiac cells. CAV3 was found to be mutated in patients with congenital LQTS and SIDS.35,36 Cav3 was coimmunoprecipitated with Na 1.5 in

rat cardiac tissue and HEK293 cells.35,37 Immunofluorescence stainings showed that the 2 proteins are colocalized at the

lateral membrane of the cardiomyocytes.35 The coexpression of NaV1.5 and the LQTS and SIDS mutants of Cav3 in HEK293 cells were also shown to increase the late Na+ inward current.35,36 It has been proposed that both CAV3 and SNTA1 mutations share a common mechanism in releasing inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, leading to an increase in NaV1.5 S-nitrosylation and, as a result, augmented late INa.30
Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase 1–Like Protein Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1–like protein (GPD1L) is an enzyme homolog to GPD1, a key enzyme of the respiratory chain. In 2002, a locus on chromosome 3 in a family with BrS was detected, and later a missense mutation in the gene coding for GPD1L was observed.38,39 Coexpression experiments showed that mutant GPD1L reduced the Na 1.5-
V
mediated I . Three other GPD1L mutations have been Na
described in babies that died of SIDS.40 Expression of these SIDS variants in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes also decreased the I , demonstrating that patients with SIDS may
Na
have decreased INa similarly to BrS. The mechanisms by which the mutations of GPD1L reduce the INa have been investigated in expression systems.41 It is proposed that Ser1503 of Na 1.5 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC)
V
and that this reduces the INa. It has been shown that the activity of PKC depends on GPD1L function, and that the mutant GPD1L variants lead to a further decrease in the INa after a diacylglycerol-dependent stimulation of PKC.41 Another possible mechanism is that the GPD1L mutant increases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and via PKC effects on mitochondria, and this decreases reactive oxygen species, which then reduce the INa by yet unknown mechanisms.42
MOG1 Multicopy suppressor of gsp1 (MOG1) is a 29-kd protein encoded by the RANGRF gene. MOG1 interacts with the intracellular loop of Na 1.5 between domains II and III.43 The 2
V
proteins also colocalize at the IDs in mouse ventricular cells. MOG1 coexpression in HEK293 cells increased the Na 1.5-
V
mediated current without altering its biophysical properties, suggesting that MOG1 is a cofactor for optimal channel expression at the cell membrane. A human study described 1 BrS variant of MOG1 that reduced the expression of Na 1.5 at
V
the cell membrane of rat atrial cardiomyocytes and decreased the I .44 The details about how MOG1 regulates the expres-
Na
sion of Na 1.5 are still to be investigated. V
Plakophillin-2 Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) is found at the IDs of cardiomyocytes. Delmar’s group demonstrated that NaV1.5 interacts not only with PKP2 at the IDs, but also in a complex with ankyrin-G and connexin43.45,46 Whether the interactions between these different proteins of the IDs are direct or indirect and the site of interaction with Na 1.5 remain to be determined.
V
In a recent study with 200 BrS patients, 5 missense mutations in the gene PKP2 were demonstrated.47 The I and the
Na
density of Na 1.5 channels at the ID were reduced when V
PKP2 mutant proteins were coexpressed.48 This experimental evidence strongly supports a role for PKP2 in targeting and regulating the density of Na 1.5 at the IDs and also its
V
implication in BrS.

Fibroblast Growth Factor Homologous Factors
Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FGFs) are cytosolic proteins that can modulate both cardiac Na+ and Ca2+ channels.49 The proximal part of the C-terminal domain of
NaV1.5 has been shown to bind to murine FGF13 and human FGF12 (Figure 1).50,51 Knockdown of FGF13 in murine ventricular myocytes decreased INa and channel availability.50 Interestingly, a genetic variant of the gene coding for human FGF12 (p.Q7R) was identified in 1 BrS patient.51 When ex-
pressed in rat myocytes, this variant reduced INa and channel availability, hence leading to a loss of function which is con-
sistent with the BrS phenotype.
Synapse-Associated Protein 97
SAP97 regulates the targeting, localization, and function of cardiac K+ and sodium channels via their PDZ domain–bind-
ing motifs located in the C termini. The interaction between
SAP97 and NaV1.5 has been demonstrated independently by the Abriel and the Jalife laboratories.8,9,25 Although there is
strong experimental evidence for a direct interaction between
these 2 proteins via the NaV1.5-SIV motif and a SAP97 PDZ domain, the exact role of SAP97 on the regulation of Na 1.5
V
function remains to be clarified.26 A mutation found in 1 pa-
tient with BrS modified the valine of the SIV motif of NaV1.5 into a methionine. This mutation was shown to specifically reduce the interaction with SAP97, but not α1-syntrophin. In parallel, the mutation decreased the number of NaV1.5 channels and I .25 It seems likely that genetic variants in DLG1,
Na
the gene coding for SAP97, will be found in patients with in-
herited channelopathies associated to SCD.

Calcium Channel Macromolecular Complexes
The voltage-gated L-type calcium channel, Ca 1.2, is the main V
pathway for the entry of calcium into cardiac cells.52 The pore-
forming CaVα1 subunit carries the main biophysical and pharmacological properties of the channel that plays a key role in
excitation–contraction coupling and AP duration. The CaVα1 subunit is modulated by interactions with different accessory
subunits (Figure 4). It is associated with 4 different β-isoforms
(CaVβ1–4) and 4 different α2-δ-isoforms (CaVα2-δ1–4). Both Cavβ and Cavα2-δ have been shown to play dual roles in regulating both the biophysical properties and trafficking of
CaV channels. In addition to these regulatory subunits, the γ subunits (8 isoforms) have been described as a third class of
accessory subunits.53 In cardiomyocytes, the fully functional
CaV1.2 channel, which is composed of at least CaVα1, CaVβ, and Ca α -δ subunits (Figure 4) can be considered as the main
V1
core macromolecular calcium channel complex.

kinetics of activation and inactivation. Furthermore, CaVβ sub-

units either regulate or are needed for the modulation of CaVα1

by protein kinases, G proteins, ubiquitin ligases of the Neural

family, and small RGK (Rem, Rem2, Rad, and Gem/Kir) pro-

teins (Figure 4).54,55 CaVβ proteins have also been shown to

interact with Ahnak1,56 a protein involved in the protein kinase
A (PKA)-mediated control of the Ca 1.2 channel. Altogether, V
these data demonstrate that CaVβ subunits play a pivotal role in the localization and regulation of cardiac calcium channels.
The CaVα1-δ auxiliary subunits are the product of a single gene that is post-translationally cleaved into α2 and δ peptides and remain associated via disulfide bonds.57 Only CaVα1δ1 and CaVα1-δ2 proteins have been found to be expressed in mouse heart.58 Coexpression of the CaVα1-δ subunit, along with CaVα1 and Cavβ subunits, accelerated activation

and deactivation kinetics and significantly increased ICa.58 Animals lacking the CaVα1-δ1 subunit demonstrated reduced basal myocardial contractility and relaxation and decreased
L-type Ca2+ peak current amplitude.59 CaVα1-δ1 has been recently shown to be essential in the regulation of the CaV1.2 channel cell surface density mediated by the deubiquitylase
USP2-45.60
The CaVγ proteins consist of 4 transmembrane domains with intracellular N- and C-terminal ends. In the human heart,
only CaVγ4, 6, 7, and 8 have been found to be expressed.53 The CaVγ subunits differentially modulate calcium channel function when coexpressed with the CaVβ1b and CaVα1-δ1 subunits, altering both activation and inactivation properties.53
The effects of Cavγ on Cav1.2 function are dependent on the subtype of Cavβ subunit.53
In cardiac myocytes, Cav1.2 channels are mainly localized in the t-tubular system (Figure 5).61 L-type calcium channels
are 3- to 9-fold enriched in the t-tubule membrane than on the
extratubular surface sarcolemma. Within the t-tubule, studies
have estimated that ≈75% of the L-type calcium channels are
localized in the dyad domains (Figure 5), thus constituting the
main Cav1.2 macromolecular complex in cardiac cells. The dyad represents a small area where Cav1.2 channels, situated on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, are in op-
position to the ryanodine receptor type 2 that is situated on
the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. An essential
component of the dyadic cleft is junctophilin 2 (Figure 5).
Junctophilin 2 is a cleft protein that anchors the t-tubular
membrane to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane; doing so
it plays a key role in maintenance and function of that space.62
In junctophilin 2 knockdown mice, reduction in the number of
dyads was observed,63 suggesting that junctophilin 2 is respon-
sible for maintaining the dyadic structure. A calcium-binding

protein, sorcin, expressed in cardiac cells, has also been
shown to interact with both Cav1.2 and ryanodine receptor type 2.64 Finally, PKA and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CaMKII), which are known to mediate the regula-
tion of Cav1.2 channel activity via their interactions with the C-terminal of the CaVα1C subunit, have also been shown to be part of the dyad.65
Recently, other partner proteins have been described to
be important in regulating Ca 1.2 expression at the t-tubule. V
Amphiphysin 2, also called bridging integrator 1, belongs
to the BAR domain proteins superfamily and is involved in membrane invagination.66 Hong et al66 have shown that
bridging integrator 1 is expressed at the t-tubules, initiates t-tubule genesis, and delivers CaV1.2 to t-tubules.66 Ahnak1 is indirectly associated with the L-type Ca2+ channel via its β2-subunit and has been shown to be located at the sarcolemma and t-tubules of cardiomyocytes.56 Similar to bridging
integrator 1, the exact localization within the t-tubule system
is not known. Nevertheless, its implication in the regulation of ICa via the β-adrenergic pathway suggests the presence of Ahnak1 and CaV1.2 channels in extradyad complexes. Dysferlin, a member of the ferlin family, has recently been
shown to be expressed mainly at the ID of cardiomyocytes and is also present at the t-tubules.67 These observations sug-
gest that other Ca 1.2 macromolecular complexes, which V
may be Cav3-dependent, also exist in the extradyadic com-
partment (Figure 5). Recently, a subpopulation of Ca 1.2 V
channels that is located in the caveolae has been found to be part of a macromolecular signaling complex, including β2adrenergic receptor, adenylate cyclase, protein phosphatase 2A, and PKA.68 Calcineurin, another interacting/regulating
protein of CaV1.2 channels, has also been shown to be present in caveolae and the t-tubule system.69 Via its association with
the adapter protein A kinase–anchoring protein (AKAP5), calcineurin interacts with Cav-3.70 Altogether, these findings
suggest the presence of t-tubular distinct Ca 1.2 macromoV
lecular complexes that are also present in extradyadic com-
partments (Figure 5).
In parallel, other groups have demonstrated that a subpop-
ulation of Ca 1.2 channels is localized to caveolae in the exV
tra T-tubular lateral membrane of ventricular cardiomyocytes
(Figure 5), thus suggesting that at least a third CaV1.2 macromolecular complex exists.68
Mutations in Genes Coding for Calcium Channel– Interacting Proteins and Associated Disorders Mutations in genes coding for calcium channel accessory
subunits have been linked to BrS and short-QT syndrome type 6.71,72 A loss-of-function mutation (p.S481L) of the CACNB2 gene, encoding the Cavβ2 subunit, was found in a BrS patient.71 Despite the large ICa mutation-induced decrease in heterologous expression systems, no reduction of CaV1.2 channel number has been observed at the plasma membrane.
This suggests another mechanism of Cav regulation than the traffic defect that is generally observed in BrS. Templin et al72
reported a mutation (p.S755T) in CACNA2D1, the gene encoding the CaVα2-δ1 subunit, in a SCD patient with short-QT syndrome. An important decrease of the I was observed with
Ca
the expression of the mutant variant without any modification

of the protein expression, thus suggesting that the single chan-

Potassium Channel Macromolecular Complexes and Associated Disorders
Cardiac potassium channel proteins are coded by >40 different genes.75 In addition, several auxiliary subunits and associated proteins are involved in the trafficking, distribution, and anchoring of potassium channels at specific microdomains at the plasma membrane, and contribute to their organization in macromolecular complexes.76 Such partners help in the control of potassium channel expression and biophysical properties, thus regulating the plasticity of cardiac electric activity both under normal conditions and in disease states. In this section, we review the interactions of the major potassium channels as part of macromolecular assemblies and the role of such assemblies in cardiac excitation and repolarization.

The Strong Inward-Rectifying Potassium Channels Among the 3 strong inward-rectifying potassium channels (Kir2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) that express in the heart, Kir2.1 is the most abundant in the ventricles. Kir channels are responsible for inward rectifier potassium current (IK1) and are involved in the depolarization, repolarization, and resting phases of the cardiac AP.77 Kir subunits assemble to form tetrameric channels in many cell types, including cardiac myocytes.78,79 IK1 contributes significant repolarizing current between −30 and −80 mV, and thus is responsible for the terminal phase of the AP.80 In addition, it serves as the primary conductance controlling the resting membrane potential in ventricular myocytes.81 These channels show strong rectification between −50 and 0 mV, which means that they remain closed during the AP plateau; they only open when the membrane potential repolarizes to levels between −30 and −80 mV, which in the normal AP occurs during the late phases of the AP. Rectification is achieved by a voltage-dependent blockade by intracellular magnesium and polyamines, such as putrescine, spermine, and spermidine,82 which interact with at least 3 amino acid residues located inside the pore of the channel.79
Loss-of-function mutations of Kir2.1 have been identified in patients affected by Andersen–Tawil syndrome, which is also referred to as LQTS type 7 and is characterized by delayed repolarization.83 Because in addition to the heart Kir2.1 is also expressed in other organs, such as skeletal muscle, Andersen–Tawil syndrome is associated with hypokalemic

periodic paralysis and skeletal developmental abnormalities.83 In the heart, reduction of I leads to QT prolongation and pre-
K1
disposes to arrhythmias; yet QT prolongation is less prominent in patients presenting Andersen–Tawil syndrome than in other types of LQTS.84 Moreover, although Andersen–Tawil syndrome patients do develop ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, SCD is rare in these patients.85
Only 3 cases of Kir2.1 gain-of-function mutation have been reported. In 2005, Xia et al86 reported on a Kir2.1 gain-offunction mutation (V93I) in a large Chinese family with atrial fibrillation. Subsequently, 2 different gain-of-function mutations (D172N and E299V) in the KCNJ2 gene were reported in patients with short-QT syndrome type 3.17,87 Increased IK1 shortens repolarization and the QT interval and exerts a proarrhythmic effect both in the atria and the ventricles.88
Kir2 Channels Have Multiple Functional Partners In 2001, Leonoudakis et al89 identified a direct association of Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 with SAP97. They further demonstrated that a complex composed of members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family (SAP97, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase [CASK], Veli, and Mint1) associates with Kir2 channels via the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif.90 Also using in vitro protein interaction assays they showed that SAP97, Veli-1, or Veli-3 binds directly to the Kir2.2 C terminus and recruits CASK and proposed a model whereby Kir2.2 associates with distinct SAP97–CASK–Veli–Mint1 complexes. Subsequently, using immunoaffinity purification and affinity chromatography from skeletal and cardiac muscle and brain, they discovered that α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin, dystrophin, and dystrobrevin, all members of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, also interact with Kir2.x channels.76 In this regard, cardiomyocytes from the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse show a small but significant decrease in Kir2.1 protein.32 It is also possible that dystrophin-related proteins contribute to determining the subcellular localization of Kir2.x channels in cardiomyocytes, similar to what has been demonstrated for Na 1.5 channels.32 As demonstrated by affin-
V
ity pull-down experiments, Kir2.1 to 3 and Kir4.1, all bind to scaffolding proteins but with different affinities for the dystrophin-associated protein complex, as well as SAP97, CASK, and Veli.90
In 2001, Dart and Leyland91 showed that Kir2.1 associates with AKAP5, which is a multivalent-anchoring protein that binds PKA, PKC, and calcineurin. AKAP5 is targeted to the intracellular N- and C-terminal domains of Kir2.1 to anchor kinases close to key channel phosphorylation sites and is required for appropriate modulation of channel function.91 More recently, it was suggested that both Kir2.1 and AKAP are part of a macromolecular signaling complex that includes the β1adrenergic receptor and SAP97.92 Kir2.1 may also associate with Cav3 in human cardiac cells. Cav3 mutations have been shown to reduce cell surface expression of Kir2.1 with consequent reduction of IK1 density. Such an effect may add to the previously described late INa increase35 and contribute to delayed repolarization and arrhythmia generation in Cav3mediated LQT9.93

Filamin-A increases the number of functional Kir2.1 channels on membrane in arterial smooth muscle cells.94 It
seems to act as a cytoskeletal anchoring protein for the Kir2.1
channel, stabilizing its surface expression. However, although
filamin has been shown to localize at the Z lines in cardiomyocytes,95 it is unknown whether pools of Kir2.x channels
colocalize with filamin-A. Finally, it has been demonstrated
that Kir2.1 interacts with the AP1 adaptin complex through an
unusual Golgi exit signal dictated by a tertiary structure, local-
ized within the confluence of the Kir2.1 cytoplasmic NH3 and COOH terminal domains.96 The signal allows properly folded
Kir2.1 channels to insert into clathrin-coated vesicles at the
trans-Golgi for export to the cell surface, which is a critical
regulatory step for controlling trafficking and cell surface expression of the Kir2.x channels.96
Kir2.1 and the Na 1.5/Kir2.1 Channelosome V
There is a strong relationship between the inward INa and the IK1, the 2 most important ionic currents controlling ventricular excitability: by controlling the resting membrane potential, IK1 modifies Na+ channel availability and, therefore, cell excitability.80 In addition, IK1–INa interactions are important in stabilizing and controlling the frequency of the
electric rotors that are responsible for the most dangerous
cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.88 Recent data demonstrated that the
INa–IK1 interplay involves a reciprocal modulation of expression of their respective channel proteins (Kir2.1 and NaV1.5) forming a channelosome within a macromolecular complex (Figure 6).9 Furthermore, evidence suggests that conditions
that result in NaV1.5 protein reduction, such as it occurs in the dystrophin-deficient mdx5cv mice, are accompanied by a concomitant reduction in Kir2.1 protein levels.32 Importantly,
the finding that coexpression of Na 1.5 may reduce internalV
ization of Kir2.1 was a central mechanistic observation, with
important implications in the control of cardiac excitability and SCD.9
Recently, Gillet et al26 investigated in vivo the interactions
of SAP97 with Kir2.1 and Na 1.5 by generating a genetiV
cally modified mouse model in which SAP97 expression was
constitutively suppressed in cardiomyocytes. As expected, IK1 was reduced in the SAP97 knockout mice (Figure 7).9,97 Unexpectedly, INa and NaV1.5 localization at the ID were unaffected by the loss of SAP97 expression. Ostensibly, the data presented by the papers of Gillet et al26 and of Shy et al25 about NaV1.5 seem to contradict previous work.8,9,97 Yet there are substantial differences between the 2 mouse
models and the previous studies that need to be considered. Most important in both mouse models,25,26 genetic modifica-
tion is present early in development, whereas in the other studies,9 SAP97 expression was silenced in adult myocytes
that were kept in culture. Therefore, it is conceivable that
the consequences on INa could be different in an inducible SAP97 knockout mouse model. However, NaV1.5 is known to interact with other regulatory proteins at the IDs, such as connexin43,98–100 PKP2,45 and ankyrin-G.101 Furthermore,
recent studies suggest that there are microdomains of Na 1.5 v
at the IDs. In particular, a population of Na 1.5 is located V
at the periphery of gap junctions in a so-called perinexus

Figure 6. NaV1.5 and potassium inward rectifier (Kir)2.1 form a macromolecular complex (a channelosome). The subcellular localization and channel activity of both NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 are regulated by protein–protein interactions by their respective carboxyl terminal (CT) PDZ (post synaptic density protein [PSD95], Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor [Dlg1], and zonula occludens-1 protein [zo-1]) binding motifs with such PDZ domain–containing proteins as synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) and syntrophin.

region that has been proposed to be involved in ephaptic conduction.102 It might be possible that constitutive deletion of SAP97 led to compensatory modifications in the expression and organization of 1 more partner proteins that contributed to maintain NaV1.5 expression.

The K Channel Macromolecular Complex ATP
ATP-sensitive K+ (K ) channels function as metabolic senATP
sors in many cell types.103 They are octameric assemblies of

a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) and an ion-conducting sub-

unit (Kir6.x).104 This enables them to directly couple their

energy metabolism to cellular excitability and function as a

crucial regulatory mechanism in the cell response to meta-

bolic demand.103 Genetic manipulation of cardiac K subATP
units has revealed a role of these channels in arrhythmia

generation.105 Human K mutations underlie different K

channelopathies and can substantially increase the risk of

heart disease.106

The pore-forming subunit of the KATP channel is 1 of 2 members of the inwardly rectifying family of K+ channels,

Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 coded by KCNJ11 and KCNJ8, respective-

ly. The 2 SUR subunits (SUR1 and SUR2) are respectively

coded by ABCC8 and ABCC9.106 Although several SUR splice

variants have been described, the most commonly studied are

SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B.107,108 Like other Kir channels,

Kir6.x subunits have a cytoplasmic N and C terminus with

2 transmembrane domains and a pore-forming H5 loop.79,106

SUR has multiple transmembrane domains with 2 large in-

tracytoplasmic loops, the first and second nucleotide-bind-

ing domains (NBD1 and NBD2), which contain consensus

sequences for the hydrolysis of nucleotides (Walker A and B motifs).109
Coexpression of the 2 types of subunit is necessary to
achieve functional expression of KATP channels and the assembly of a specific Kir6.x with a specific SUR generates currents
with a particular single-channel conductance, nucleotide regulation, and pharmacology.103 However, accumulating evidence
suggests that the KATP channel protein complex is part of a multisubunit macromolecular complex that may also include
additional metabolically active protein subunits, including adenylate kinase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase.110
In addition, it has been demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins pro-
mote the cell-surface expression of heterologously expressed
and native KATP channels by functionally antagonizing the arginine-based endoplasmic reticulum localization signal that
many ion channels and proteins require to reach the cell surface, and that is present in SUR1.111 Recently it was shown that
KATP channels are stalled in the Golgi complex of ventricular, but not atrial, cardiomyocytes.106 It was also demonstrated that
PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the C terminus of Kir6.2 by sustained β-adrenergic stimulation leads SUR1-containing channels to reach the plasma membrane of ventricular cells by
silencing the arginine-based retrieval signal. Therefore, it was
suggested that sympathetic nervous stimulation might enable
adaptation to metabolic challenges by releasing K channels ATP
from storage in the Golgi.106
In a recent proteomics study, glycolytic enzymes previ-
ously described for the K channel complex were shown to ATP
coimmunoprecipitate with K channel subunit from heart, ATP
endothelium, and pancreas,108 suggesting that glycolytic ATP

production contributes to fine tuning of K channel opening ATP
in these tissues.
Physical interaction between cardiac KATP channels and the Na+/K+ ATPase has also been suggested, which might
provide mechanistic insight into their functional interaction
with regards to possibly sharing or competing for the same local pool of submembrane ATP/ADP.112 Finally, Kir6.2 and
SUR2A are expressed at a higher density at the IDs in mouse
and rat hearts, where they colocalized with PKP2 and plako-
globin. The disruption of the desmosomal complex in PKP2-
deficient mice results in downregulation of KATP channels, suggesting a possible role of these channels in cell-to-cell communication.113

Diversity of Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels

Voltage-gated potassium (K ) channels are members of the V
Shal subfamily of voltage-gated K+ channel pore-forming

α-subunits.114 KV channels are formed by assemblies of 4 αsubunits plus accessory subunits.115 They function to control

resting membrane potentials, shape AP characteristics and

influence the responses to neurotransmitters and neurohor-

mones. There are extensive differences in their kinetics of

activation and inactivation among the various KV channels, and specific channels underlie specific currents in the heart.

For example, K 4.x channels, including K 1.4, K 4.2, and

V

KV4.3, coded by KCNA4, KCND2, and KCND3, respective-

ly, activate and inactivate rapidly and underlie the transient

and forms the atria-specific ultrarapid delayed rectifier K+

current (IKur), inactivates much more slowly.116 KV7.1 is coded by KCNH2,117 the human ether-a-go-go-related gene

nels in mouse ventricular myocytes leads to prolongation of

Functional Interactions of KV Channels in their Microenvironment

In the heart, KV4.2, KV4.3, and KV1.4 may assemble to gen-

erate transient outward currents. KV4.3/KV4.2 subunits form

the rapidly recovering I channels, whereas K 1.4 forms the

slowly recovering Ito channel, both of which underlie the early

phase of AP repolarization and contribute to the AP plateau.122

Both channel types are differentially expressed in the ventri-

cles, contributing to regional heterogeneities in AP shape and

duration.123

Substantial evidence indicates that these channels func-

tion as integral components of macromolecular protein com-

plexes,114 and that expressed K channels can be regulated V

by post-translational modifications, including phosphoryla-
tion.114 Also coexpression with accessory or regulatory pro-
teins in heterologous expression systems modifies cell surface
expression, subcellular distribution, channel stability, and
biophysical properties of KV4 channels.124 Hence, the specificity of channel-mediated signal transduction is most likely the
result of association of these integral membrane proteins with
discrete sets of partner proteins or from their assembly into
stable macromolecular complexes.125 However, the informa-
tion available about the functioning of accessory subunits and
other regulatory proteins in the generation and regulation of
native cardiac KV channels is limited.126
β-Subunits and Voltage-Dependent K+ Channels The β-subunits of KV channels (KVβ) are cytoplasmic proteins that have a mass of ≈40 kDa. Nine KVβ-subunits are encoded by 4 genes. They have been shown to associate with K
V
α-subunits. The KVβ1, KVβ2, and KVβ3 proteins, which are coded by different genes, are the only KVβ proteins expressed in the mammalian heart.114 Additional variability is produced
by alternative splicing on the N-terminal region. KVβ subunits are localized in the cytosol with a conserved carboxyl ter-
minal and a variable amino terminal; they form a tetrameric
structure and are associated in a 1:1 ratio with the α-subunit.
KVβ1 and KVβ3 associate with α-subunits early during their biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and exert a chaper-
one-like effect enabling their stable expression at the plasma
membrane.127 Notably, this chaperone-like property of KVβsubunit does not apply to all KV channels.115
The most important effect of KVβ1 on the voltage-dependent outward current is to accelerate its rate of inactivation,
an effect that is mediated through a ball-and-chain like pro-
cess whereby the KVβ1 N-terminal domain blocks the inner cavity of the KV α-subunit pore.128 In addition, by binding to the C terminus of the KV channel, KVβ can accelerate the C-type inactivation.129 In heterologous expression systems,
coexpression of KVβ1.3 with KV1.5 is necessary for the cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent PKAmediated increase in K+ current.130 Moreover, consistent with
the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites on the α- and β-subunits, PKC reduces the K+ current of KV1.5 channels only when coexpressed with KVβ1.2,131 which may provide an explanation for the effects of the β-adrenergic or PKC stimulation on IKur in human atrial myocytes.132 The duration and the frequency of membrane depolarization can significantly mod-
ify the rate of inactivation of I in human atrial myocytes. Kur
This effect is modulated by the activation of CaMKII and may
also involve the interaction between KVβ and the KVα1.5 subunits.133 The contribution of I to the abbreviation of the AP

duration during atrial fibrillation134 and the fact that the KV1.5 channel is more abundantly expressed in atrial than ventricu-
lar myocardium are additional examples of the important role
played by KVβ subunits in cardiac pathophysiology.116 Finally, KVβ subunits have been shown to confer sensitivity to redox modulation and hypoxia to KV4.2 channels.135
Other Ancillary Subunits of K channels V
The best-known partner of KV4 channels is the cytoplasmic K channel–interacting protein, KChIP2, which has been
V

shown directly to be an essential component of Ito,f channels in myocardium. The KChIPs were first identified in brain using

the KV4 N terminus as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen.136 They were shown to have 4 EF (EF hand calcium binding motif)-

hand-like domains and bind calcium ions. The expression of

KChIP and K 4 together reconstitutes several features of naV
tive A-type currents by modulating the density, inactivation

kinetics, and rate of recovery from inactivation of K 4 chanV
nels in heterologous cells.136 All 3 KChIPs were shown to co-

localize

α-subunits,

and therefore to be integral components of native KV4 channel

complexes.136 KChIP2 assembles with the N terminus of the

pore-forming KV4 α-subunit and acts as a chaperone to regulate both surface expression and electrophysiological proper-

ties of the channel.137 In heart, KChIP2 coimmunoprecipitates

tricles, and the targeted deletion of the mouse KChIP2 locus

gous K 4.2 knockout mice, suggesting that K 4 and KChIP2

proteins reciprocally regulate each other’s expression.138,139 In

mouse ventricles, the KChIP2 mRNA level is somewhat larger

in the epicardium than the endocardium.140 In contrast, large

transmural gradients in KChIP2 expression together with

large Ito,f density gradients have been demonstrated across the human and the dog ventricular walls.139

Dipeptidyl peptidase–like protein 6 is a protein that regu-

lates the activation and inactivation properties of cardiac KV4 channels.114,141 Dipeptidyl peptidase–like protein 6 increases

heterologously expressed KV4 α-subunits at the cell surface,142 shifts the voltage dependences of activation and inactivation

currents to more negative potentials, and accelerates the rates

of current activation, inactivation, and recovery.141–143 Notably,

when dipeptidyl peptidase–like protein 6 is coexpressed with

K 4.3 and KChIP2, it yields K currents that closely resemble

V

V

native cardiac Ito,f.141

Transient outward K+ currents can be modulated by pro-

tein kinases.144 The nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase c-Src

is a member of a family of 9 closely related membrane-bound

kinases defined by a common structure with a catalytic kinase

domain and amino-terminal regulatory regions termed Src ho-

mology 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) domains.145 These modular do-

mains mediate intramolecular and intermolecular interactions

that are important in signal transduction. The KV4.3 sequence contains SH2 and SH3 domain-binding motifs, making K 4.3
V
a strong candidate for direct interaction with and phosphoryla-

tion by c-Src. Gomes et al146 have shown through glutathione

S-transferase pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation,

that KV4.3 protein associates with c-Src and that the SH2 and SH3 domains of the kinase mediate this interaction, which

may result in enhanced efficiency of KV4.3 phosphorylation by c-Src leading to rapid modulation of KV4.3 channel activity.
SAP97 and KV1.5 subunits can interact, directly or indirectly, both in the heart and in heterologous systems.137,147

Adenoviral overexpression of SAP97 in neonatal rat atrial

myocytes leads to clustering of endogenous K 1.5 subunits at V
myocyte–myocyte contacts and an increase in both IKur and the number of 4-aminopyridine–sensitive potassium channels in

cell-attached membrane patches.148 However, pull-down and

coimmunoprecipitation assays in cardiac myocytes showed

that the KV4 channel C terminus, SAP97, and CaMKII interact together, and that the interaction is suppressed by

SAP97 silencing and enhanced by SAP97 overexpression.137

In HEK293 cells, SAP97 silencing reproduced the effects of

CaMKII inhibition on current kinetics and suppressed KV4/ CaMKII interactions. Altogether, the above data suggest that

SAP97 is a major partner for surface expression and CaMKII-

dependent regulation of cardiac KV4 channels. As reviewed comprehensively elsewhere,114 KCNE genes

encode a family of single transmembrane domain proteins

called minK-related peptides (MiRPs) that function as ac-

cessory β-subunits of KV channels. When coexpressed in
heterologous systems, MiRPs confer changes in KV channel conductance, gating kinetics, and pharmacology.114

Coexpression of KV4 and KV4-KChIP2 channels with MiRP1 affects the kinetics and the voltage-dependent properties and

recapitulates the overshoot in peak current amplitude dur-

ing current recovery,149 that is evident in human epicardial

ness. Mutation of arginine to histidine (p.R83H) in MiRP2 is

associated with periodic paralysis.151 Finally, targeted deletion

of Kcne2, which encodes MiRP1, reduced (≈25%) ventricular

Ito,f densities by 25% with negligible changes in total or surface KV4.2 expression.153
TheKCNE1 gene encodes a 129 amino acid protein in

mouse and human that modifies the currents generated by

hERG or KVLQT1. The delayed rectifier K+ currents resulting
from expression of KVLQT1 alone are small and activate rap-
idly, but IKs is reconstituted when minK is coexpressed with KVLQT1.154 Evidence suggests that KCNE1 may have preferential expression in the conduction system.155 Mutations in

KCNE1 have been reported to cause LQTS.156

MiRP2 is a member of the MinK-related peptide fam-

ily that is coded by KCNE3. It coimmunoprecipitates with

KV4.3 from human atria.157 Interestingly, a missense mutation (p.R99H) in KCNE3 was identified in a family with

on KV4.3 currents.157 Altogether, the above data suggest that MiRP2 is required for normal functioning of human Ito,f channels and that gain-of-function mutations in MiRP2 predispose

KCNQ1 (KvLQT1)
The KCNQ1 gene, encodes the K 7.1 channel protein, which V
can form heteromultimers with 2 other potassium channel pro-
teins, KCNE1 and KCNE3.159 In the human heart, the KCNQ1
encodes the pore-forming α-subunit, and KCNE1 (also known
as minK) encodes the regulatory β-subunit of the KCNQ1–
KCNE1 complex responsible for IKs, the slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ repolarizing current.160 Mutations in KCNQ1

are associated with hereditary LQTS1 (also known as Romano– Ward syndrome), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, and familial atrial fibrillation.161 In 2002, Marx et al121 showed that modulation of IKS β-adrenergic receptor stimulation requires targeting of cAMP-dependent PKA and protein phosphatase 1 to hKCNQ1 through the AKAP-9, also known as yotiao. These authors elegantly demonstrated that yotiao binds to the human KCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by an LQTS mutation (hKCNQ1-G589D). Identification of the hKCNQ1 macromolecular complex reveals a mechanism for sympathetic nervous system modulation of cardiac action potential duration (APD) through IKS.121 These data provided compelling evidence that the cardiac IKs potassium channel is a macromolecular complex consisting of α-(KCNQ1) and βsubunits (KCNE1) and yotiao (AKAP-9), which recruits PKA and protein phosphatase 1 to the channel.121
Kv11.1–HERG
The human erg protein (hERG or Kv11.1) is the pore-forming subunit of the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) responsible for AP repolarization.162 It is encoded by the hERG gene,163 which comprises 3 members, erg1, erg2, and erg3, displaying varying expression patterns in different tissues;164 herg1 is the best characterized.163 Structurally, hERG has 6 transmembrane domains (S1–S6), S4 being the voltage sensor, with cytosolic N and C termini. The N terminus, which contains a PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain, strongly affects the biophysical properties of the channel. Functional hERG channels are tetramers with a pore region responsible for K+ current flow through the plasma membrane.162 As reviewed elsewhere, alternative transcription of hERG1 results in 2 identical proteins, hERG1a and hERG1b, that diverge only in their N termini.165 hERG1b can form channels alone or coassemble with hERG1a. A third variant of hERG1, also identical to hERG1a but with a modified C terminus is termed hERGuso.166 Expression of hERGuso reduces the number of channels at the sarcolemma and the current density. In contrast, coassembly with hERG1b alters channel kinetics increasing channel availability current magnitude.167 Mutations in hERG lead to long-QT syndrome type 2, a major cause of arrhythmias,168 as well as to short-QT syndrome type 2, which results in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.169
Even though heterologously expressed hERG channels are largely indistinguishable from native cardiac I , a role for
Kr
KCNE1 in this current was suggested by the diminished IKr in an atrial tumor line subjected to minK antisense suppression.170 Subsequently, McDonald et al171 showed that hERG and minK formed a stable complex and that the heteromultimerization regulated IKr activity. This provided additional support for the idea that minK, through the formation of heteromeric channel complexes, is central to the control of the heart rate and rhythm. hERG has been shown to also coimmunoprecipitate with PKA,172 and similar to other cardiac KV channel subunits hERG interact with SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive-factor attachment protein receptors), which are proteins that are critical for synaptic vesicular secretion and possibly membrane protein trafficking.173 Recently, Ma et al168 identified 23 potential interacting proteins that may regulate

cardiac IKr through cytoskeletal interactions, G-protein modulation, phosphorylation, and downstream second messenger and transcription cascades. Fifteen such proteins were identified as hERG amino terminal (hERG-NT)-interacting proteins, including the caveolin-1, the zinc finger protein FHL2, and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 12 (PTPN12). The other 8 proteins were identified as hERG carboxylic terminal (hERG-CT)-interacting proteins, including the NF-κB– interacting protein myotrophin.168 Several unexpected binding partners were identified which greatly enhanced the dynamic modulation of I as part of a macromolecular complex.168
Kr
KCNQ1–HERG Interactions
After the pioneering studies of Sanguinetti et al,154 it became clear that IK, the delayed rectifying K current responsible for cardiac repolarization, is mediated by 2 distinct currents, IKr and I , which work together to produce cardiac repolariza-
Ks
tion and control the APD. Recent results suggest that in addition to their voltage-dependent interactions, these 2 channels also interact at the molecular level.174 For example, studies in both transgenic LQT rabbit cardiomyocytes and stable, heterologous cell lines reported that hERG and KCNQ1 underwent reciprocal, functional downregulation in that coexpression of wild-type or dominant-negative pore mutants of KCNQ1 significantly reduced hERG currents, and vice versa.175 More recently, the same laboratory conducted acceptor photobleach Förster resonance energy transfer experiments and demonstrated that the intermolecular KCNQ1–hERG interactions are direct and mediated by their respective COOH termini.174 In agreement with the above results, another group showed that KCNQ1 preferentially coimmunoprecipitated with mature hERG channels that were localized on the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells.176 However, the latter group demonstrated that although hERG channels undergo rapid endocytic degradation on exposure to hypokalemia, KCNQ1 channels are relatively insensitive to extracellular K+ reduction.176 Thus, when hERG and KCNQ1 were expressed separately, exposure to 0 mmol/L K+ for 6 hours completely eliminated the mature hERG channel expression but had no effect on KCNQ1. However, contrary to the transgenic rabbit data,174 the latter investigators showed that when hERG and KCNQ1 were coexpressed, KCNQ1 significantly delayed the hypokalemia-induced hERG loss.176 Also, hERG degradation led to a significant reduction in KCNQ1 in hypokalemia.176 Therefore, although biophysical and pharmacological analyses conducted by both groups indicate that hERG and KCNQ1 closely interact with each other, their respective results seem to go in opposite directions: the former group concluded that coexpression of KCNQ1 significantly reduced hERG currents and vice versa,174 whereas the latter group concluded that coexpression of KCNQ1 protected hERG against hypokalemia, and hERG reduction reduced KCNQ1.176 Clearly additional studies will be necessary to resolve this controversy.
Perspectives and Conclusions
We have briefly reviewed research conducted over the past 20 years showing that cardiac ion channels may function as part of large macromolecular complexes. Such complexes play

crucial roles the transcription, translation, oligomerization, trafficking, membrane retention, glycosylation, post-translational modification, turnover, function, and degradation of all cardiac ion channels known to date. In fact, macromolecular complexes are vital to a wide collection of cellular tasks. Some of these require physical contact among partner proteins, others do not. Understanding the structure and signaling dynamics of multiprotein assemblies is vital to understanding their function and is likely to shed light on how the heart functions in health and disease. However, we are still lacking a detailed knowledge of such processes, and of the role played by the myriad of ion channel molecular assemblies in the compartmentalization of ion channel function and the mechanisms underlying ion channel dysregulation, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and SCD. This is a significant problem because both arrhythmias and SCD are among the most important causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Clearly, many more studies are needed to establish new paradigms of cardiac electrophysiology integrating the large diversity of molecular interactions involved in the formation, targeting, and regulation of cardiac ion channels and their function, as well as the tissue-specific expression of the components of ion channel complexes not only in the working cardiac muscle of the atria and ventricles, but also the specialized pacemaking and conduction systems. Progress likely will come from the use of systems biology approaches, from the nanoscale all the way to the cellular and organ levels. Progress should also derive from the development and application of modern technologies enabling adequate spatiotemporal resolution to visualize and quantify the processes involved in the assembly and dynamic interactions of ion channel macromolecular complexes in living native myocytes from animal models, as well as in human stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes.
