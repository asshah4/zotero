Physical Examination of the Liver

C. David Naylor, MD, DPhil, FRCPC

CLINICAL SCENARIO
The patient in your examining room is new to the practice. He is 52 years old, emigrated from Southeast Asia about 10 years ago, and has no specific complaints except fatigue. On examination you find little of note except that his liver edge is firm, easily felt, and ex-
tends about 6 cm below the costal mar-
gin across much of the right upper quadrant. The span, by light percussion, is 17
or 18cm. Should you be concerned? What does the research literature tell us about
the meaning of these findings? Ideally, the clinical meaning of phy-
sical examination findings should be
established in research studies that ac-
count for the overall context, including other signs and details from the medical history. This approach is difficult in liver disease, because the physical manifestations of hepatic dysfunction are protean and many multisystem diseases affect the liver. Our focus, therefore, is on physical examination of the liver itself. This means, however, that we implicitly depend on the clinician's ability to make
a baseline estimate of the likelihood of
liver disease on the basis of the history and/or other physical findings.
Although many maneuvers recom¬
mended in liver examination are unproven, there is reasonable evidence that
the presence or absence of hepatomeg¬ aly can be determined with moderate accuracy on physical examination. De¬ scriptive studies suggest that other qualitative findings may help in clinical

assessment ofpatients with possible liver disease. Liver examination, like most physical diagnosis maneuvers, is not dis¬ similar to a screening test; it may sup¬ port or refute hypotheses generated by the history, and generate further hy¬ potheses itself, allowing more selective use of imaging techniques and labora¬ tory tests as tools to confirm the sus¬ pected diagnoses.1
TOPOGRAPHY
Situated intraperitoneally in the right upper quadrant, the liver seldom ex¬
tends more than 5 to 6 cm across the
midline into the left upper quadrant.
The upper surface is convex and nestles
under the diaphragm typically at the
level of the fifth or sixth anterior rib in
quiet respiration. The lower surface tends to be concave, with the gallblad¬ der in it. Although the fundus of the gallbladder may project below and an¬ teriorly to the lower liver edge, it is not felt in healthy persons.
The bulk of the liver sits posteriorly
where it cannot be assessed from be¬
hind because of intervening retroperitoneal contents, ribs, and lumbar mus¬ culature. Anteriorly, the liver sits partly above the costal margin, with ribs and lung supervening, and partly below it. The portion extending below or inferior to the costal margin varies and typically runs parallel to the costal margin. How¬ ever, physicians working in modern im¬ aging departments, like generations of surgeons and anatomists before them, can attest to the degree of variability in the shape of the organ, including the extent to which the lower edge parallels the costal margin and the degree of ex¬ tension beyond the midline into the left upper quadrant (Fig 1). To some extent, the vertical liver span (ie, the linear dis-

tance from the top of the liver dome
down to the lower edge) is a function of where in the right hypochondrium the liver edge is palpated or percussed (Figs 1 and 2). The falciform ligament joins
the midanterior surface of the liver to
the diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall. With respiration, diaphragmatic contraction drives the liver downward,
and the anterior surface of the organ
rotates slightly to the right. In quiet inspiration and expiration, the excur¬ sion is approximately 2 to 3 cm.
A SUGGESTED APPROACH TO LIVER EXAMINATION
We assume that, as part of the gen¬ eral abdominal examination, you have already inspected the abdomen, includ¬ ing the right upper quadrant, looking for obvious irregularities or deformities. Then, in adults without a history or physical findings suggestive of poten¬ tial liver disease, palpate for the lower liver edge. Start with gentle pressure in the right lower quadrant; ask the pa¬ tient to breathe in gently and slowly to bring the liver edge down to the exam¬ ining fingertips. At each exhalation, move the fingers up about 2 cm. If the edge is not felt, no further examination is suggested.
If the edge is felt, confirm that you are palpating roughly in the middle of the right portion of the abdomen, ie, corresponding to the midthoracic line or
so-called midclavicular line (MCL). Mark
the lower edge. Then, in the same ap¬ proximate plane, percuss down from

about the level of the third rib, with the pleximeter finger (the finger that you strike with the percussing finger) laid horizontally. Typical lung field resonance
will be heard. Move one rib space at a
time until the tone changes because of the interposition of the dome ofthe liver behind the air-filled lung. There will be a gradation with increasing dullness as you move caudally and the volume of the air-filled lung overlying the liver is diminished (Fig 3).
To confirm increased dullness, spread two or three pleximeter fingers over adjacent rib spaces and percuss quickly a number of times from greater to lesser resonance. If doubts persist, have the patient take a deeper breath and hold it; then percuss to confirm an unequivocal
increase in resonance at that rib space. Determination of a level for the upper
edge of liver dullness is sometimes helped by placing the middle finger over the likely level for initial tone change and laying the second and ring fingers on adjacent rib spaces. Again, percuss back and forth. The percussion tone over the fourth or ring (ie, top) finger should be resonant; the second or index finger, unequivocally dull; and the third finger,
in between.
Try to ensure that the lower and up¬ per borders are marked either in quiet respiration or, if deep breaths are taken, in the same phase of respiration.
In instances during which you have other evidence to suggest liver disease, but the liver edge was not palpable, at¬ tempt to locate the lower edge by gentle percussion in the right lower quadrant, following the plane ofthe MCL and again

working from resonance to dullness. Tricks similar to these (eg, multiple pleximeter fingers and manipulating level of dullness with changes in depth ofrespiration) may help confirm the find¬ ing. If there is no definite tone change up to the costal margin—a not uncom¬ mon finding—end the attempt to define
liver size. Determination of vertical liver span
in the MCL can be done two ways. We
recommend gentle percussion for locat¬ ing the upper liver border and palpation or gentle percussion to locate the lower
border. An alternative is to use firm per¬
cussion, deliberately ignoring whether or not the lower edge is palpable.
Liver size correlates with body size, and liver shape correlates with habitus.
Liver span is greater in men than women
and in tall vs short persons. However, as a rough guide, an MCL span of less than 12 to 13 cm with gentle percussion alone orgentle percussion combined with palpation makes hepatomegaly very un¬ likely. Ranges of normal have been es¬ tablished for firm percussion (Table 1) but will vary among clinicians depend¬ ing on percussion techniques. Enlarge¬ ment suggested by percussive span alone is weaker evidence for hepatomegaly than span based on palpation ofthe lower liver edge.
Apart perhaps from the situation of fulminant hepatic failure, observing re¬
duction in liver span is of limited use¬ fulness since many other features of
chronic liver failure will be present in
situations in which reduction in paren-
chymal mass has occurred. When the liver edge is palpable, trac-

Fig 2.—Variation in liver span according to the ver¬ tical plane of examination. Since there is variability
in where clinicians determine the midclavicular line
to be, the inevitable consequence is that liver span may also vary, even if multiple observers are
perfectly accurate in measuring it.
Fig 3.—Percussive resonance varies with the thick¬ ness of interposed air-filled lung tissue. The per¬ cussion note changes with decreasing resonance caudally as less air-filled lung tissue is interposed

ing the edge and defining its character¬ istics qualitatively is recommended primarily in persons who are strongly suspected of having liver disease. Aus¬ cultation is seldom helpful. Once you have a high index of suspicion about liver disease, biochemical tests and bi¬
opsy are the main events; the more eso¬
teric findings on physical examination

EVIDENTIARY BASIS FOR THE APPROACH
Inspection
Visualization of infracostal extension
of the liver is occasionally possible when
malnutrition and/or cachexia thin out
the overlying tissues or when there is massive hepatomegaly. No studies, to our knowledge, describe the yield from inspection of the liver outline in the ab¬ domen, but clear-cut abnormalities should at least be specific thereby rul¬ ing in hepatomegaly and underlying dis¬
ease.
Auscultation
Friction rubs may occur with primary and metastatic malignancies, after liver biopsies, with infective and inflamma¬ tory conditions, and with or without con¬ comitant hepatomegaly. Rubs, though always abnormal, are rare and nonspe¬ cific; even with careful examination of patients with liver tumors, no more than 10% of patients have a rub.2"4

cultation is provided by Sapira,5 includ¬ ing bruits and hums occurring in and around the right upper quadrant. Con¬
siderable time can be spent on auscul¬ tation, but there is no evidence that these

findings are helpful in routine examina¬ tion. Features reputed to help separate
bruits of arterial and venous sources are
noted in Table 2. Venous hums occur in
portal venous hypertension ofany cause. The hum, a low-pitched murmur with systolic and diastolic components, arises
from communication between the um¬
bilical or paraumbilical veins and ab¬
dominal wall veins. The responses of venous hums to Valsalva's maneuver,
splenic pressure, or ingestion of meals
are inconsistent.6' Other causes of true continuous murmurs, such as arterio-
venous fistula in the splanchnic circu¬ lation or hepatic hemangioma, are un¬ common, and arterial bruits rarely have such lengthy diastolic spillover that they
sound continuous.4,8 Arterial bruits over the liver or in the
epigastrium have been described with
most liver tumors, as well as alcoholic
hepatitis.2·4·811 However, among patients with liver disease in general (eg, a con¬ venience sample of cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and malignancy), the preva¬ lence of bruits has been reported at less than 3%.8 Both clinically9 and with phonoangiographic enhancement,8 the murmurs associated with alcoholic hepa¬ titis and malignancy cannot be distin¬ guished from one another, although the
former resolve if and when the condi¬
tion improves. The prevalence of clini¬ cally audible bruits in patients with con¬
firmed liver cancer varies from 10%n to
as much as 56%.12 Kingston et al13 re¬ ported a diastolic component to most bruits heard in their patients with hepatoma. About 1% to 2% ofunselected patients on a general medical service will have abdominal bruits of some kind,4 and the ability of clinicians to distin¬ guish hepatic from other arterial bruits
has never been assessed.
Auscultation over the liver should be
considered only when history and other

physical findings are suggestive of he¬ patic disease; even then, the findings should be interpreted cautiously.
A PALPABLE LIVER EDGE: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Cirrhosis or infiltrative disorders in¬
crease the firmness of the liver edge and the likelihood of its being felt indepen¬ dent of effect on organ size.14 Among gastroenterologists, agreement on the presence ofa palpable liver edge is about 50% greater than expected by chance alone.15 More interobserver disagree¬ ment would be expected in ordinary practice.
There is a paucity ofdata on the preva¬ lence of palpable livers in the general population. One study16 has reported data on palpability of the liver among 1000 military personnel (717 men and 283 women) undergoing routine exami¬ nation; 852 subjects were 40 years of age or younger. Palmer, the author and sole examiner, excluded any persons in whom liver disease was suspected or
who were difficult to examine. In 57% of
subjects, the liver either was not pal¬ pable in the right upper quadrant or was felt just at the costal margin. An additional 28% descended only 1 to 2 cm below the costal margin. Findings were similar for both sexes. The proportion of palpable livers was inflated by two fac¬ tors. First, all subjects were examined in deep-held inspiration. Second, as Palmer himself cautioned, "there is no question but that many of the poten¬ tially palpable livers would have been
overlooked if this had not been a spe¬
cially directed study." Ability to palpate the liver is not
closely correlated with liver size in stud¬ ies using reference standards such as
scintigraphy or ultrasonography.1720 (Al¬
though many published studies use scin¬ tigraphy as a reference standard, it does

have the drawback of motion artifact in
conventional applications.) Patients un¬ dergoing liver scintiscan are preselected, and a high proportion of palpable livers might be expected. However, studies from nuclear medicine departments show that although the overwhelming majority of patients scanned have some infracostal extension of the liver, less than half of these patients had palpable livers.14·18"21 In one study, Rosenfield et
al22 chose 100 scintiscans at random and
compared the findings with the clinical records. Among patients without defi¬
nite evidence for liver disease in the
medical records, mean scintigraphic ver¬ tical span in the right MCL was similar among those with palpable (12.9 cm) and nonpalpable organs (12.5 cm), as were the proportions in each category (45% vs 55%). Overall, the chance that a pa¬ tient with a palpable liver also had liver disease were 63% (36 of 57 patients; 95% CI, 49% to 76%), but the chances of a palpable liver meeting scintigraphic cri¬ teria for enlargement were only 46% (24 of 52 patients; 95% CI, 32% to 61%). Studies14·22·23 on palpability and hepatomegaly are summarized in Table
3. This distinction between abnormal and
enlarged livers is a recurrent problem
because livers may be abnormal yet not
enlarged. What of the converse proposition, ie,
that a nonpalpable liver is not enlarged? Since normal livers usually extend be¬ low the costal margin yet may not be palpable, this proposition rests on an assumption that enlarged livers will be diseased, abnormally hard, and there¬ fore much more easily felt. As summa¬ rized in Table 3, a nonpalpable liver does reduce the probability of hepatomegaly, even though a palpable organ has less than a 50% chance of being enlarged. These figures are influenced by the pooled prevalence ofhepatomegaly, 23%

in these studies. As a prevalence-free parameter, we can report that the pooled likelihood ratio24 (LR) for hepatomegaly, given a palpable liver (LR+), is 2.5. The LR in the absence ofpalpable hepatome¬ galy (LR-) for the presence of an en¬ larged liver detected by scanning is 0.45. However, there will likely be a workup bias in these figures as a result of pref¬ erential referral of patients with pal¬ pable livers for scintigraphy. This bias would arguably lead to a slight overes¬ timate of sensitivity and still larger un¬ derestimate of specificity. If specificity were higher, the LR+ would be stron¬ ger. In any event, an LR approach is most useful if you know the prior odds of hepatomegaly for representative co¬ horts ofpatients with various diseases— a set of numbers that are currently un¬ known and should be the subject of
research in the future.
In sum, a palpable liver is not neces¬ sarily enlarged or diseased but does in¬ crease the likelihood of hepatomegaly.
The vertical liver span and overall clini¬ cal context must also be considered. Con¬
versely, a nonpalpable liver edge does not rule out hepatomegaly but does re¬ duce its likelihood. This is particularly relevant in those settings of low prior probability of liver disease where fur¬ ther examination is likely to have little yield if the liver cannot be felt.
WHAT ELSE CAN BE LEARNED FROM PALPATION?
Da Costa28 wrote 70 years ago, "Tac¬
tile sense decides the questions of he¬ patic tenderness, pulsation, friction, and
thrills and determines the consis¬ ...
tence and the contour of its anterior and
lower surfaces." However, there are few data on the reliability and accuracy of
these qualitative judgments about liver edge characteristics.
A pulsatile liver edge is well docu-

mented in tricuspid valvular disease.26"28 Although this sign may be present clini¬ cally in the majority of cases,29 no mod¬ ern studies adequately document the frequency of the association and its re¬ lationship to differing degrees of tricus¬ pid valvular dysfunction. Unequivocal pulsatile hepatomegaly is also reported in 35 of 55 consecutive patients (64%; 95% CI, 50% to 76%) with confirmed constrictive pericarditis accumulated in two separate case series.30·31 The low false-negative rates give this sign some potential value in a setting where con¬ strictive pericarditis is already sus¬ pected. Unfortunately, as Osier32 noted a century ago, there is a need to distin¬ guish between an expansile liver edge and transmitted aortic or right ventricu¬ lar impulses that are commonly present.
There are no data on examination ma¬
neuvers to make such a distinction, al¬ though inspiratory increase in the mag¬ nitude ofthe pulsation has been reported
anecdotally with tricuspid insufficiency.26 Detection of differential timing of he¬ patic pulsations has been described (eg,
A vs V waves) but is rare and doubtless
difficult to pinpoint.27 Palpation for an expansile liver edge
should be limited to cases of suspected tricuspid valve disease or constrictive pericarditis.
The other qualitative parameters are consistency, nodularity, and tenderness of a palpable liver edge. Among mul¬ tiple expert observers examining vari¬ ously alcoholic or jaundiced patients,
statistics for chance-corrected agree¬
ment were 11 % for abnormal consistency of a palpable liver edge15 and 26%15 or 29%M for presence of nodularity. Only
agreement on tenderness of the liver
edge was within a useful range at 49%.M Palpation to describe the liver edge
qualitatively or to detect isolated en¬ largement of the left (caudate) lobe of
the liver should therefore be considered
primarily if there is other evidence of
organ disease or concern about liver tu¬
mor and even then, is optional.
ASSESSING VERTICAL LIVER SPAN
Unequivocal reduction in liver size
should be detectable in fulminant he¬
patic failure. However, no evidence was located to support the common belief that a substantial proportion of persons with chronic cirrhosis have detectably small livers by physical examination. The focus herein is accordingly on hepatome¬ galy.
Since half of all palpable livers are not enlarged, measurement of vertical liver span in some plane is required. The usual reference point is the MCL. However,
unless care is taken in examination, the MCL can be "a wandering landmark,"

with documented interobserver varia¬
tion as much as 10 cm.34 Variation in the
MCL will inevitably lead to imprecision in liver span assessments (Fig 2). Note also that vertical span could only be an accurate predictor of liver mass if the
organ were more or less cuboid rather
than irregular. Palpation should, in theory, be the
most reliable and accurate method of
locating the lower border of the liver to
measure organ span. Two studies12,33
report specialists' ability to agree on distance from the costal margin to a pal¬ pable liver edge, an approach that over¬ states accuracy by eliminating the larg¬
est source of error—location of the up¬
per border of the liver.14,19,35 Meyhoff et
al12 further controlled interobserver dis¬
agreement by having all measurements made at a predetermined MCL. Mean
maximum interobserver difference
about distance from the costal margin was 6.1 cm (SD, 2.7 cm) in the MCL. Intraobserver variation was smaller, with differences not greater than 2 cm
in 60% to 80% of MCL measurements.
There was no clear relationship to liver size, a finding that underscores the need
to measure span from the upper border
of the liver not the costal margin. Theodossi et al33 performed a similar experi¬ ment without marking the MCL. The
intraclass correlation coefficient was
0.66, analogous to a weighted of more than 60%. However, agreement beyond chance on whether the liver was truly enlarged was only 30%.
What are the alternatives to localiz¬
ing the lower liver edge by palpation? The scratch test is performed by placing the diaphragm of the stethoscope at the xiphisternum or over the liverjust above the costal margin in the MCL. Starting low in the abdomen, a finger is moved up the abdomen scratching gently. The intensity becomes greatly enhanced once the finger is over the lower border of the liver.36 The other major alternative is percussion.
Comparative studies are summarized
in Table 4.19,36 Two caveats are in order. Both studies involved limited numbers
of observers and patients. As well, the overall accuracy in the report by Fuller et al36 is greatly exaggerated on two scores. First, the ultrasonographic mea¬ surement was made in a plane defined by the observers. In actual practice, the
MCL ofthe clinical observer varies from
that of the scintigrapher or ultrasonographer,34,35 a situation that was appli¬ cable for the patients examined by Sul¬ livan et al.19 Second, Fuller et al took
their measurements from the costal
margin.
The scratch test may be a useful ad¬
junct to percussion or palpation in lo-

eating the lower edge of the liver. How¬
ever, further studies are needed before it can be recommended for routine use.
Also shown in Table 4 are the results
of other studies in which the authors
used percussion and/or palpation to lo¬ cate the lower liver edge. Excluded is one outlying study in which 100% ofmea¬
surements were accurate within 2 cm of
scintigraphic MCL span and exact agree¬
ment at the 0.1-cm level is claimed for several observations.17 We also exclude
a study using direct percussion without a pleximeter finger37; this study related
mean clinical liver span to ultrasono-
graphic span, but lacked measures of either case-by-case absolute span dis¬ crepancies or categorical agreement on organ normalcy.
Once span has been determined, cli¬
nicians must still decide whether the
liver is enlarged or not. Blendis et al38 reported that among 28 patients with blood dyscrasias or liver diseases ex¬ amined by four observers, three of four observers agreed in 93% of cases about the presence or absence of hepatic en¬ largement, but the data do not permit a
correction. Theodossi et al,33 with five observers and a structured history and physical examination on 20 jaundiced patients, reported a for presence or absence of hepatomegaly of 30%. More¬ over, agreement among the qualitative judgments of clinicians and an external
reference standard is modest. For ex¬
ample, Blendis et al38 found that in the
cases in which at least three clinicians
agreed on hepatomegaly, concordant as¬ sessments of radiological liver surface area were found in only 48% of cases. Halpern et al20 compared judgments re¬
corded in medical charts with a conve¬
nience sample of 214 scintigraphic im¬ ages with 16 cm as the cut point. Accu¬ racy was 66%, slightly higher than in the Blendis study. However, when cor¬ rected for agreement expected on the basis of chance alone, the resulting statistic was only 32%. Naylor et al36 used 15 cm as a cut point for scinti¬ graphic hepatomegaly and, with two ob¬
servers, found that the accuracy of clini¬
cal examination ranged from 67% to 82%, depending on the observer and choice of clinical threshold value for determining the presence of hepatomegaly. Correct¬ ing for chance agreement, the statis¬ tics ranged from 28% to 55%. Overall, it appears that combinations of palpation and percussion yield modest accuracy greater than expected by chance alone in determining whether the liver is en¬ larged or not.
Castell et al39 suggested measuring span by percussion alone. They exam¬ ined 116 healthy subjects to establish a range of normal for percussive span in

the MCL and midsternal line. Since the

goal was to establish a clinical range of normal, there was no reason to validate the measurements against a reference

standard. Percussive span correlated
positively with height and differed be¬

tween males and females as would be

expected from autopsy studies (Table 1).

Formulas to predict span were derived

that incorporated height and weight.

The advantages of percussion alone

are that observers may not agree on the
presence of a palpable liver, and pal¬ pable livers will often be felt below the

point where the percussion note changes.

The latter occurs because the thin lower

liver edge may not cause dullness. Thus, since not all livers are palpable, you must

rely on palpation in a variable propor¬ tion of subjects, and these subjects will

tend to have somewhat larger liver

spans. However, clinical MCL span com¬

pared with technetium scintigraphic

span is less accurate when the lower
border is nonpalpable,14,19 and errors are always greatest in the upper border that can only be approached by percus-
sion.14,19,35 It therefore seems counterin¬

tuitive to propose examining liver span

by percussion alone. Also, the forceful-

ness of percussion greatly modifies the

measured span.19,39,40 Use of percussive

span therefore demands that each ob¬ server double-check his or her own range
of normal against the established norms

to ensure that strength of percussion is

not a confounder.

Another group used the percussive span technique41 to examine 46 patients with liver disease. There was signifi¬

cant disagreement among six examin¬ ing clinicians, presumably because of

strength and plane of percussion. Inter-

observer agreement on the appraisal of

the organ as "small," "normal," or "en¬ larged" was excellent only for massively

enlarged livers. If moderately enlarged

organs (ultrasound volumes between
2000 and 2700 mL) are included, the

probability of any two randomly chosen observers agreeing on the presence of hepatomegaly was between 40% and

75%.

This limited performance is perhaps

understandable since the concept ofper¬ cussive span rests on the questionable assumption that it consistently under¬

estimates liver span allowing for reli¬ able demarcation of abnormally sized

livers. Nonetheless, Castell et al39 are

the only group to establish a range of

normal for clinical liver span that re-

Use of percussion alone to determine span, independent of whether or where the lower liver edge is felt, remains fea¬ sible. However, clinicians should stan¬ dardize their percussion technique and compare their typical findings in normal subjects to published normal ranges. Fu¬
ture research should evaluate the clini¬
cal utility of the percussive method as compared with methods using percus¬ sion and palpation, with and without the
"scratch test."
PHYSICAL FINDINGS IN CONTEXT
In the foregoing studies, accuracy is generally defined against a single ref¬
erence standard such as ultrasound or
scintigraphy. This procedure contrasts with studies such as the one by Rosen-
field et al22 in which measured span and
palpability were compared with evidence
in the clinical record for any liver dis¬
ease. The latter study has the advan¬ tage of capturing the fact that although all truly enlarged livers are diseased,
not all normal sized livers are free of disease.
A further problem with many studies is the extent of blinding. Some studies
blind observers to all details of the pa¬
tients' history and other physical find¬ ings. Others ask observers to perform a structured history and physical exami¬ nation or set inclusion criteria (eg, jaun¬ diced or alcoholic patients) that will af¬ fect clinicians' judgments. The nature and extent of confounding from this vari¬ able is unknown, but it seems probable
that the extent of interobserver agree¬
ment, and even the match between clini¬
cal judgments and reference standards, will be affected by the amount of infor¬
mation available to the examiner.
Finally, few studies try to place liver findings in the overall context of clinical decision making. Sapira1 has noted that
clinical liver span assessments need not
match closely ultrasonographic or scin¬ tigraphic measures, since the "clinical worth" of a sign is its potential contri¬ bution to clinical decision making. Of interest, Espinoza et al15 used stepwise discriminant analysis to assess the abil¬ ity of a variety of physical findings to distinguish among 50 consecutive alco¬ holic patients presenting variously with cirrhosis, noncirrhotic alcoholic liver dis¬
ease, or no clinical/biochemical evidence
of liver disease. Three variables—spi¬ der nevi, splenomegaly, and abdominal wall collateral veins—appeared useful; liver examination findings were not sig¬
nificant contributors to the differential
diagnostic exercise. Similarly, Theodossi et al·42·43 examined the ability of a large array of symptoms and signs to differ-

enfiate between medical and surgical causes of jaundice. They found that de¬ scent of the liver edge more than 2 cm below the costal margin was more com¬ mon with surgical causes of jaundice (P<.01), but the independent contribu¬ tion of this sign to the overall diagnostic
process was unclear.
Both studies started with populations
that had liver disease and determined
whether physical diagnosis helped in cat¬ egorizing the type of disease. Neither addresses whether the physical exami¬ nation was helpful in deciding which pa¬ tients had liver disease in the first place.
Little is known about the real contri¬
bution of liver examination findings to the overall clinical diagnostic and man¬ agement process. This topic should be a research priority.
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO GET BETTER AT EXAMINING THE LIVER?
No educational studies, to our knowl¬ edge, have tested methods to improve your accuracy and precision in examin¬ ing the liver, but a few suggestions can be hazarded. First, once you are com¬ fortable examining the liver, pursue the
various shortcuts recommended herein.
Early on, however, it is useful to check the liver span by percussion even in per¬ sons with a low probability of liver dis¬ ease and a nonpalpable organ. This can help you begin to understand what your own range of normal is likely to be. Sec¬ ond, check your reliability by reexamining stable patients and comparing your follow-up assessment with your first im¬ pressions. Third, both tyros and experts should quantitatively and qualitatively benchmark their physical examinations of the liver against findings on nuclear examination or ultrasound. Try to de¬ termine how you are doing in assessing
vertical liver span or extent of descent
of the edge below the costal margin or in "calling" the presence of hepatome¬ galy. Fourth, consider the potential er¬ rors in locating the MCL. If sequential clinical span assessments are being made (eg, fulminant hepatic failure or treat¬ ment of hepatic métastases), it may help to record a reference plane such as 10 cm from the midline or, alternatively, where the lateral edge of the rectus abdominus crosses the costal margin.44
THE BOTTOM LINE
Once historical data and other physi¬ cal signs have been elicited, the addi¬ tional value of a detailed physical ex¬
amination of the liver remains uncer¬
tain. Moreover, just as diagnostic tests yield little at the extremes ofprior prob¬ ability, so also would you expect less yield from liver examination in persons who are not suspected of having liver

disease or who are obviously suffering from some hepatobiliary complaint.
A selective approach to physical ex¬
amination of the liver is therefore sug¬
gested. Palpate to locate the lower liver
border in the MCL in situations of low
probability of liver disease. If the liver is not palpable, one can defensibly forgo any further examination in patients with¬
out reasons to suspect liver disease.
Since, however, palpation of the abdo¬ men is difficult in some subjects, light percussion remains an option to confirm lack of extension of the liver edge below the costal margin and/or guide further palpation. With a palpable lower edge, MCL span can be ascertained by light percussion of the upper border. A span
of less than 12 to 13 cm reduces the
probability ofhepatomegaly. In persons with an impalpable liver and a high prob¬ ability of liver disease, measuring span by percussion alone may also be worth¬ while; tables of norms have been pub¬ lished, although these apply to moder¬ ate or heavy percussion methods. Pal¬ pation specifically to assess the quality of the liver edge is recommended only if there are signs of liver disease, includ¬ ing unequivocal hepatomegaly. Auscul¬
tation over the liver has a limited role in examination.
