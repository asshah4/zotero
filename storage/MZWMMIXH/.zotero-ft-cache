Mental stress is recognized as a risk factor for HF, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We predict that stressinduced autonomic dysfunction is associated with worse HF outcomes. Methods: We examined 753 participants with stable CAD at an university-affiliated healthcare system from 2011 to 2016. Mental stress was evoked using a public speaking task and high-frequency heart rate variability (HFR HRV, signifying vagal withdrawal) was measured via Holter monitoring at rest and during mental stress. The primary outcome was a composite of acute (incident) and acute on chronic (worsening) HF in the inpatient or outpatient setting. Fine-Gray suddistribution hazard models were used. Results: Participants had a mean age of 58 years, 35% were female, and 43% were Black. The median follow-up time was 5.66 years. In fully adjusted models for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher HFR HRV during mental stress was associated with a decreased risk of composite HF events (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.73-0.87] per standard deviation increase, P<.0001). Stronger associations were observed with HF with reduced ejection fraction than HF with preserved ejection fraction, especially in fully adjusted models. Conclusion: Stress-induced autonomic dysfunction predicts HF outcomes in patients with CAD and may be an independent mechanism in HF disease progression.
