ABSTRACT Background: Hospitalization for nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation (NVAF) is common and results in substantial cost burden. Current national data trends for the incidence, stroke risk proﬁles, and mortality of hospitalization for NVAF and atrial ﬂutter (AFL) are sparse. Methods: The Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was used to identify patients  20 years with incident NVAF/AFL (NVAF, ICD-9 code 427.3 or ICD-10 I48) in any diagnosis ﬁeld from 2006 to 2015 in Canada, except Quebec. National and provincial trends in rate over time (rate ratio, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]) were calculated for age-sex standardized hospitalizations. Trends in stroke risk proﬁles and in-hospital mortality rates adjusted for stroke risk factors were also calculated. Results: A total of 578,947 patients were hospitalized with incident NVAF/AFL. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range: 68-84),

RESUME Introduction : Les hospitalisations en raison de ﬁbrillation auriculaire non valvulaire (FANV) sont frequentes et aboutissent à un fardeau considerable des coûts. Les tendances nationales des donnees

Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is the most common sustained rhythm disorder.1 Many patients with AF are hospitalized, either for management of symptoms, other consequences such as heart failure or thromboembolic events, or as a result of complications of therapy.2-5 Older studies from Europe and North

America, including the only estimates from Canada, have reported high rates of hospitalizations due to AF, with trends increasing over time.6-9 Hospitalizations represent the largest proportion of direct AF-related health care costs.10-12
The number of persons with AF is expected to rise signiﬁcantly because of an aging population, increasingly adverse lifestyles, and cardiovascular risk factors that predispose to development of AF.10 Given the symptomatic and episodic nature of AF, the higher burden of illness may lead to more and costly admissions. On the other hand, there may be a shift to outpatient management of AF or more patients with AF being discharged from emergency departments instead of hospitalized.

82% were  65 years, 54% were men, 54% had a CHADS2  2, and 69% had a CHA2DS2-Vasc  3. The overall age- and sex-standardized rate of NVAF/AFL hospitalization was 315 per 100,000 population and declined by 2% per year (P < 0.001). There was an annual rate decline in NVAF/AFL hospitalizations in every province. The majority of hospitalized patients are at high risk of stroke, and this risk remained unchanged. The average adjusted in-hospital mortality was 8.80 per 100 patients 95% CI, 8.80-8.81 with a 2% annual decline in rate (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Between 2006 and 2015, we found national and provincial hospitalization rates for incident NVAF/AFL are declining. The majority of patients are at high risk for stroke. In-hospital mortality has declined but remains substantial.

allocation, understanding trends in the prevalence rates of incident AF hospitalizations, the clinical characteristics of patients, and their prognosis in a contemporary era are needed.
Accordingly, we evaluated trends in prevalence rates of incident nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation (NVAF) and atrial ﬂutter (AFL) hospitalizations, stroke-risk proﬁles, and associated in-hospital mortality rates using the Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database for the years between 2006 and 2015 in Canada.
Methods The Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI)
Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), which contains information for all hospitalizations in Canada except Quebec, was used to identify patients  20 years with AF/AFL using International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 9th revision clinical modiﬁcation ICD-9-CM codes 427.3 or ICD-10 code I48, in any diagnostic ﬁeld, from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2015.13 Data from Quebec are submitted to CIHI directly by the ministère de la Sante et des Services sociaux du Quebec in a different database and format that is not consistent with other provinces. To further identify patients with incident NVAF/ AFL, we excluded patients who had index hospitalizations with NVAF/AFL in the 2 years before the start of the study (April 2004 to March 2006), in addition to valvular heart disease, those residing in Quebec, outside of Canada, or with unidentiﬁed gender. In the case of multiple hospitalizations over the study period, the ﬁrst hospitalization with NVAF/ AFL was deﬁned as the index hospitalization. In a secondary analysis, we evaluated incident hospitalizations with AF/AFL as the primary diagnosis.
Demographics were assessed at the time of the incident NVAF/AFL, and data on the presence of stroke risk factors

(ie, components of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age  75, diabetes, previous stroke or systemic embolism [CHADS2] and congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 65 to 74 or  75 years, diabetes, previous stroke or systemic embolism and arterial vascular disease and female sex [CHA2DS2VASc]) were obtained from the same CIHI DAD database if the conditions were present in the 2 years before the incident diagnosis of NVAF/AFL. The outcome measure was in-hospital death during index hospitalization.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were summarized as median with interquartile range for continuous variables and absolute number with proportion for categorical variables. CochraneArmitage trend was performed to explore trend over time for categorical data, and nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was done for continuous data. The unit of analysis was patients with NVAF/AFL. Crude rate was calculated as the number of patients with incident NVAF/AFL in a given ﬁscal year (FY) divided by the Canadian population estimate of that FY. Similarly, provincial rates for incident NVAF were calculated as the number of patients with incident NVAF/ AFL receiving inpatient care in a given province, in a given FY, divided by the provincial population estimate of that FY. Age- and sex-standardized rate was calculated per 100,000 of the population, with a direct standardization approach using the 2016 census population of Canada as the reference population. Patients and Canadian population were grouped by sex and in age groups starting from 20 to 80 years with 5-year age increments and ﬁnally > 80 years. Poisson regression analysis or negative binomial in case of overdispersion was done to assess the trend in rate over time or differences in rates across provinces. All analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 version (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Results
Cohort characteristics
There was a total of 632,343 patients with incident AF/ AFL identiﬁed over a 10-year period. After excluding patients with valvular heart disease (n ¼ 51,248) and those residing in Quebec, outside of Canada, or with unidentiﬁed gender (n ¼ 2148), a total of 578,947 patients with incident NVAF/AFL comprised the ﬁnal study cohort. The median age was 77 years (interquartile ratio [IQR]: 68-84), and 54% were men (Table 1).
AF/AFL hospitalization rates
The overall crude and age-sex standardized hospitalization rates for incident NVAF/AFL were 288 per 100,000 population (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 287-289 per 100,000 population) and 315 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 315316 per 100,000 population). The absolute number, crude, and age-sex standardized hospitalization rates for incident NVAF/AFL from 2006 to 2015 are shown in Figure 1. The ageand sex-standardized incidence of hospitalization for AF in any diagnostic ﬁeld declined overall from 368 to 284 per 100,000 population over the study period, representing a 2% (rate ratio [RR]: 98%, 97%-99%) annual rate decline (P < 0.001).

The overall crude and age-sex standardized hospitalization rates for incident NVAF/AFL as the primary diagnosis were 58.1 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 57.7-58.4 per 100,000 population) and 63.1 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 62.2-63.5 per 100,000 population, Table 2). The ageand sex-standardized incidence of hospitalization as the primary diagnosis declined from 77.9 to 54.3 per 100,000 population over the study period, representing a 4% (RR: 0.96, 0.94-0.99) annual rate decline (P ¼ 0.005).
The overall age-sex standardized hospitalization rates for incident NVAF/AFL across the provinces and territories is shown in Figure 2. For this analysis, 5104 patients, who did not receive inpatient care in their residential provinces, were excluded. The lowest rate was in the territories (263 per 100,000 population), and the highest was in Saskatchewan (338 per 100,000 population. There was a decrease in the crude and age-sex standardized incident NVAF/AFL rates across all the provinces over time (Table 3). The annual rate decline ranged from 0.6% in Ontario and Nova Scotia to 3.5% in Saskatchewan. The annual rate decline in age-sex standardized rate ranged from 5.0% in Manitoba to 14.2% in New Brunswick.
Stroke-risk proﬁle
The majority of the hospitalized NVAF/AFL cohort was at high risk of stroke. Overall, 82% of hospitalized patients with

NVAF/AFL were  65 years, 54% had CHADS2  2, and 69% had a CHA2DS2-Vasc  3 (Table 1). Age category of 65 to < 75 years signiﬁcantly increased from 22.4% to 24.4% (a relative 8.9% increase), whereas the proportion of patients  75 years of age decreased from 60.2% to 57.2% (a relative 5.0% decrease). The proportion of patients with CHADS2  2 increased over time from 51.6% to 54.3%, with a relative increase of 5.2%, whereas the proportion of patients with CHA2DS2VASc scores  2 remained stable (Table 1). Over time, the proportion of patients with histories of hypertension (23.1%) and diabetes (15.2%) increased, whereas histories of heart failure (8.1%), arterial vascular disease (21.6%), and stroke/transient ischemic attack (3.2%) decreased (Figs. 3 and 4).
In-hospital mortality
The overall rate of death during incident hospitalization for NVAF/AFL was 9.4% (95% CI, 9.3%-9.5%; n ¼ 54,527). The absolute number, crude, and adjusted rates of death are shown in Table 4. The crude death rate ranged from 8.69 (95% CI, 8.45-8.93) in 2015 to 10.00 (95% CI, 9.75-10.27) in 2008, and adjusted death rate ranged from 9.50 (95% CI, 9.25-9.75) in 2007 to 8.09 (95% CI, 7.87-8.32) in 2015.

Over the study period, there was a 1% to 13% relative decrease in rate with a 2% annual rate decline. In-hospital mortality rate by provinces is shown in Figure 5.
Discussion Between 2006 and 2015, we found that national and
provincial age- and sex-standardized rates of hospitalizations for incident NVAF/AFL as any diagnosis and as a primary diagnosis have declined over time. Regardless of the applied stroke-risk scheme, the majority of patients hospitalized are at high risk. Of the known stroke risk factors, age category of 65 to <75 years, hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure have increased over the study period. In-hospital mortality remains high and has had only declined by 2% annually.
Previous studies6-9 from several countries from the early 1980s to early 2000s have consistently reported that population rates of all AF-related hospitalizations have increased over time, yet little is known regarding trends in the incidence of AF hospitalizations. A population-based cohort study from Denmark6 found a 60% (95% CI, 30%-100%) increase in ﬁrst-ever hospitalization for AF from early 1980s and early 1990s. Contrary to that report, our data, which include more

recent years, found the rate of admission to hospital for incident NVAF/AFL has declined by 2% annually. Furthermore, we found admissions for NVAF/AFL as a primary diagnosis decreased even more than overall AF admissions. Our ﬁndings are supported by the only other study14 that has reported on incidence rates for any AF hospitalization, which demonstrated a 1.1% annual downward trend from 1995 to 2010 in Western Australia. Although these are modest declines, given the high cost burden associated with AF-related hospitalizations,15 any rate reduction will translate into a meaningful difference.
There are several possible explanations for the observed decline in the national and provincial rates of incident NVAF/AFL hospitalizations. First, the threshold for admission has likely increased, given the growing demands on a limited number of inpatient beds. Second, physicians in emergency departments have become more comfortable initiating rate or rhythm strategies (ie, cardioversion), thereby alleviating patient symptoms and need for admission.16 Third, a downward trend in the incidence of NVAF/AFL hospitalization may be offset by increases seen in other health care settings. In a population-based study performed in the province of Alberta, age- and sex-standardized AF inpatient incidence rates decreased 21% between 2000 and 2005 but rose 50% in the outpatient setting.17 Another study performed in all Ontario emergency departments found the annual number of ED visits for AF increased by 29%, whereas hospital admissions decreased by almost 10% over the 8-year period.16 Similarly, an analysis from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample for 2007 to 2014 found a signiﬁcant increase in the annual ED visits for AF of 31.7% (P for trend ¼ 0.008), whereas rates of admission decreased by 11.4% (P for trend 0.017) during this study period.18 In addition, further investigations are needed evaluating whether changes in AF risk factors, ED practice patterns, admission standards, and burden of outpatient AF care may be some of the reasons for the decline seen within each of the provinces.
Determining risk of stroke for patients with NVAF/AFL has been a cornerstone guideline recommendation19-21 and an identiﬁed performance measure among several professional

societies.13,22 The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) AF/AFL quality indicator (QI) group recently published an update on clinically important QIs to determine standard quality of care, and measuring the proportion of patients with NVAF/AFL according to stroke-risk strata (CHADS2, CHA2DS2VASc) has remained a priority QI.13 Using the CIHI database, in which risk of stroke could only be assessed with relevant elements of the scores obtained from administrative data and then calculated, we provide the ﬁrst national data on this AF QI, demonstrating that the majority of hospitalized patients would be categorized as high risk for stroke and continue to be over time.
At present, we were not able to abstract whether patients with NVAF/AFL and incident hospitalization were already taking oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, had it prescribed in hospital or if a contraindication to stroke prevention therapy was present. Although previous work has found less than 50% of hospitalized high-risk patients were on warfarin within 90 days of discharge,8 further research is needed on the impact of non-vitamin K antagonists,23,24 which are safer and easier to use than warfarin. The hospital setting provides a distinct opportunity to review the use of strokeprevention therapy. A Danish study of 108,791 newly diagnosed AF found that the prescription rate for OAC therapy after discharge increased from 29.8% to 43.5% from 1995 to 2004.25 Among a similar cohort, a Canadian study found prescriptions for OAC therapy increased from 51% to 64.5% after hospital discharge over a 9-year period ending in 2006.26
The in-hospital mortality for patients with an incident hospitalization for NVAF/AFL of 9.4% was high and likely reﬂects the older age and comorbidities of hospitalized patients. However, the main analysis included anyone with a diagnosis of AF, and, in most cases, this may have been an incidental comorbidity. Regardless, it was encouraging to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant 2% annual decline (or relative decrease of 11% to 13%) in the hospital mortality rate even after adjusting for confounders over the study period. Although data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database also demonstrated that in-hospital mortality decreased for hospitalizations with AF as the primary diagnosis (1.2% in 2010 to 0.9% in 2010, relative 29% decrease), the mortality rates were much lower than observed in our study.27 The

only comparable in-hospital mortality rate (8.2%) was seen for patients hospitalized for AF and a history of heart failure, which had a prevalence of 0.3% to 1.2% in the NIS database. In contrast, heart failure was a comorbid condition in at least a quarter of patients in our study. Understanding the clinical-risk proﬁles for patients hospitalized with incident AF may further explain provincial differences in mortality rates. If a province admits a higher proportion of sicker patients it will be reﬂected in a higher mortality rate compared with another province that does not. This further stresses the importance of both preventive measures for NVAF/AFL and the comorbid conditions that predispose to it, as well as early treatment interventions as indicated for management of AF.

Limitations
There are several limitations of our analyses that warrant further discussion. First, administrative data can be subject to misclassiﬁcation; however, the administrative code for AF and many of the comorbidities have been previously validated.13 Second, the CIHI does not capture lifestyle, anthropometric, laboratory, imaging, or symptom status, which may provide further insight into patient proﬁles that prompted admission. Third, CIHI does not possess data on out-of-hospital mortality or speciﬁc cause of death. Fourth, data are limited to hospitalizations, and therefore trends in ED and outpatient visits over this period could not be reported. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this study underscores the importance of having a rigourous and sustainable mechanism to measure QIs to capture NVAF/ AFL care fully across Canada and trends over time. In particular, data from non-hospital settings in which management is large and increasing, improving cohort accuracydas ICD codes were not designed to deﬁne NVAFdand combing provinces into regions to address subgroups with relative small numbers, making estimates uncertain. CCS QI AF/AFL work could address these and other gaps.

Conclusion
In this contemporary study, we found that both the crude and age- and sex-standardized rates of hospitalizations for incident NVAF/AFL are declining, both nationally and across provinces. The majority of hospitalized patients with NVAF/ AFL were at high risk of stroke, and this remained consistent over time. In-hospital mortality was high even though the rate declined annually.
