Decreased heart rate (HR) variability is associated

with increased mortality after myocardial infarc-

tion, but the prognostic value of HR variability in

patients without recent myocardial infarction and

its correlation with other clinical and angiographic

data have not previously been reported. In the pre-

sent study, detailed clinical assessments and 24-

hour ambulatory electrocardiograms

were per-

formed prospectively on 100 patients undergoing

elective coronary angiography. HR variability was

inversely correlated with HR (r = -0.38, p =

O.OOOl), diabetes mellitus (r = -0.22, p = 0.025)

and digoxin use (r = -0.29, p = 0.004), but not

with left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of cor-

onary artery disease or other clinical, electrocardio-

graphic or angiographic variables. All patients

were followed for 1 year. Major clinical events af-

ter initial discharge occurred in 10 patients and in-

cluded 6 deaths and 4 coronary bypass operations.

Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only vari-

able that correlated with the occurrence of a clini-

cal event (p = 0.002). Decreased HR variability and

ejection fraction were the best predictors of mortal-

ity (both p <O.Ol), and the contribution of HR vari-

ability to mortality was independent of ejection

fraction, extent of coronary artery disease and oth-

er variables. Furthermore, 11 patients with HR

variability <SO ms had an l&fold increase in mor-

tality compared with patients with HR variability

>50 ms (36 vs 2%, p = 0.001). Thus, decreased

HR variabllity is a potent independent predictor of

mortality in the 12 months following elective coro-

nary angiography in patients without recent myo-

cardial infarction.

D ecreased heart rate (HR) variability, as assessed by analysis of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings, has recently been shown to be associated with increased mortality following acute myocardial infarction.‘T2 Patients with sudden cardiac death also have depressed HR variability compared with normal control subjects.3,4Although the precise mechanism for these associations has not been established, it has been speculated that aberrant HR variability may reflect alterations in cardiac autonomic tone which could predispose to the development of lethal arrhythmias.5 However, the association between HR variability and other clinical and angiographic parameters in patients with coronary heart disease has not been well defined. Furthermore, the value of decreased HR variability in predicting outcome .in patients without recent myocardial infarction has not previously been reported. The present study prospectively examines the relation between HR variability and other clinical, electrocardiographic and angiographic variables in patients without recent myocardial infarction, and determines the utility of HR variability in predicting clinical cardiac events during a 12-month follow-up period.
METHODS
Patient selection: From November 1985 to May 1986, 112 patients <70 years of age undergoing nonemergent cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography for evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease were asked to participate in the study. Patients were excluded if they had a myocardial infarction within 4 weeks, known or suspected valvular heart disease other than mitral valve prolapse or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Three patients refused to participate and 1 patient subsequently did not undergo coronary angiography. Five patients were later determined not to meet entry criteria (3 patients with cardiomyopathy, 1 with aortic stenosis and 1 patient older than 70 years of age) and were excluded from further analysis. Two patients had inadequate ambulatory electrocardiograms and 1 had atria1 fibrillation which precluded analysis of HR variability. The remaining 100 patients form the study population for this report.
Data collection: After giving informed consent, each patient underwent a complete history and physical examination with particular emphasis placed on cardiac history, coronary risk factors, functional class and medications. All patients had a 24-hour ambulatory monitor

placed the night before cardiac catheterization (the monitor was removed during the procedure due to technical considerations). Tapes were scanned by a Delmar Avionics 9000A Trendsetter with previously validated supplemental software for analysis of HR variability. HR variability was calculated as the standard deviation of 5-minute means of sinus cycle lengths in milliseconds. All ectopic complexes and beats bounding ectopic complexes were excluded from the analysis, as were 5-minute intervals with fewer than 30 evaluable sinus cycles. Data on HR and atria1 and ventricular arrhythmias were also recorded. Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography were performed using standard techniques. Left ventricular angiography was performed in the 30° right anterior oblique projection and ejection fraction was calculated using the area-length method.‘j Coronary angiograms were read without knowledge of the clinical or electrocardiographic data, and 150% diameter narrowing of a major epicardial vessel or branch was considered significant.
Follow-up: Complete 12-month follow-up data were collected on all patients by mailed questionnaires, telephone contact or both. Major events during the followup period were defined as documented acute myocardial infarction, revascularization by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass surgery, and death from any cause. One patient successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest was also classified as a death. Information was obtained from patients’ families or private physicians or both regarding circumstances of death for the 6 patients who died during follow-up.
Statistical analysis: All clinical, electrocardiographic, angiographic and follow-up data were analyzed on the Washington University IBM mainframe computer using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software package.7 Correlation coefficients between specific variables and HR variability, all endpoints and mortality were calculated. Groups were compared using t tests for continuous variables and chi-square analysis or Fisher exact test for discrete variables. Multiple regression analysis was performed to test for variable independence in association with specific outcomes. The value of Q!was 0.05 for all analyses.
RESULTS Patient characteristics: The mean age of our pa-
tients was 55 years (range 24 to 69) and 66 were men. Systemic hypertension (43%), diabetes mellitus (22%) and cigarette smoking (47%) were common, and the plasma total cholesterol averaged 226 mg/dl. All patients had New York Heart Association functional class I through III angina (mean 2.3); only 5 patients had a past history of congestive heart failure. Most patients were taking 1 or more antianginal medications and 10 patients were also taking digoxin.
The catheterization findings are shown in Table I. Twenty-eight patients had no significant coronary stenosis, while 5 patients had significant obstruction of the left main coronary artery. The remaining patients were

evenly distributed between those with 1, 2 and 3-vessel
coronary disease. Most patients had normal ventricular function, with a mean ejection fraction of 65%. Fifteen
patients had an ejection fraction <50%. The results of 24-hour ambulatory electrocardio-
graphic monitoring are also listed in Table I. Mean HR was 68 beats/mm with an average HR variability of 86 f 30 ms. Atria1 premature complexes were relatively
infrequent (mean 7/hour), while ventricular premature
beats were more common (mean 36/hour). Sixteen patients had ventricular couplets and 11 patients had more advanced grades of ventricular ectopy.
Correlation of heart rate variability with other vari-
ables: HR variability was inversely correlated with HR
(r = -0.38, p = O.OOOl),use of digoxin (r = -0.29, p = 0.004) and presence of diabetes mellitus (r = -0.22, p = 0.025). These was also a trend toward lower HR
variability in women (79 f 27 vs 90 f 31 ms, p = 0.07). No significant correlation was found with age,
other risk factors, functional class, other medications, angiographic variables or other data from 24-hour am-
bulatory monitoring. Follow-up: Major clinical events occurring during
the 1Zmonth follow-up period are listed in Table II.
There were no documented myocardial infarctions, but 4 patients had coronary bypass surgery. There were 6
deaths, including 1 patient resuscitated from cardiac arrest.
Table III lists the correlation of specific variables
with the occurrence of clinical events during follow-up. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only variable predictive of subsequent clinical events. However, HR
variability was significantly lower in patients who died (55 vs 88 ms, p = 0.008). Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, low cholesterol, HR and digoxin use also
correlated with death during follow-up. Using multiple

regression analysis, HR variability remained an independent predictor of mortality after adjusting for ventricular function, extent of coronary disease, digoxin use, diabetes mellitus and smoking (p <O.OS).
To assessthe effect of markedly reduced HR variability on prognosis, the data were dichotomized at 50 ms. Thus, 11 patients with low HR variability were compared with 89 patients with HR variability >50 ms. Extent of coronary artery disease and left ventricular function was not different between groups. During follow-up the incidence of major clinical events was significantly higher in patients with depressed HR variability (36 vs 7%, relative risk 5.1, p = 0.01). This difference was due entirely to a markedly increased mortality in the low HR variability group (36 vs 2%, relative risk 18, p = 0.001).
DISCUSSION Heart rate during sinus rhythm is modulated by a
complex array of parasympathetic and sympathetic influences. In healthy young adults, resting HR is mediated predominantly by vagal tone. Beat-to-beat fluctuations in resting HR-particularly in association with respiration-produce sinus arrhythmia, which may be quite marked in conditioned athletes and has been generally regarded as indicative of cardiovascular titness.8 With vigorous activity or stress, vagal tone is withdrawn and HR is regulated principally by adrenergic activity to the extent that a maximum HR >200/minute can be readily achieved in young subjects. Thus, wide variations in HR both at rest and with activity are commonly seen in healthy individuals.9J0
By contrast, a number of physiologic and disease states produce alterations in autonomic function which attenuate the incremental changes in HR occurring both at rest and with stress.“-l6 Although resting HR does not change significantly with increasing age, there is a decrease of resting sinus arrhythmia and a linear decline in maximal attainable HR.9 These changes can be attributed to a decline in efferent vagal cardiac tone and decreased /3-adrenergic responsiveness associated with increased age. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy has also been associated with attenuation of the normal fluctuations in HR.17J8

A number of lines of evidence suggest an association between alterations in resting HR, attenuation of HR variability and cardiovascular prognosis.1-4J9-23 In the
Framingham study,21 resting HR at study entry in patients free of cardiac disease was found to correlate with
subsequent cardiovascular mortality and in particular with sudden cardiac death. This association was inde pendent of other known cardiovascular risk factors; Per-
sistent sinus tachycardia has been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarc-
tion22,23 or chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with documented sudden cardiac death have recently been shown to have decreased HR variability relative to
normal control subjects.3 Patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy may also be at increased risk for sudi
den cardiac death despite the absence of documented preexisting heart disease.‘9 Finally, in a recent report by Kleiger et al,’ decreased HR variability was found to be
a potent predictor of cardiac mortality after acute myocardial infarction, an effect that was independent of
ventricular function, ventricular ectopic activity, HR and other previously identified prognostic indicators.
In the present study, HR variability was found to
correlate inversely with HR, diabetes and digoxin use, but not with other clinical, angiographic or Holter variables. Kleiger et al’ also found a moderate inverse correlation with HR (r = -0.52). However, HR variability was a much more potent predictor of subsequent mortality than HR alone.’ The present study supports these findings.
Table III illustrates the value of selected clinical, Holter and angiographic variables in predicting cardiac events during follow-up. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only predictor, consistent with numerous

prior studies demonstrating the prognostic importance of this variable.24-26 Although left ventricular dysfunction was the best predictor of late mortality, reduced HR variability also correlated strongly and independently with this endpoint. The combination of reduced ejection fraction (<50%) and low HR variability (<50 ms) was particularly ominous: both patients with these findings died during follow-up.
In the study by Kleiger et al,’ HR variability <50 ms was associated with a particularly poor prognosis. Although the method for HR variability calculation in the present study differed from that used by Kleiger, there was again a strikingly higher mortality in patients with HR variability 60 ms. Thus, reduced HR variability is associated with a poor prognosis, not only in patients with recent myocardial infarction’ but in those without infarction undergoing elective coronary angiography.
The mechanism underlying the increased mortality in patients with low HR variability is not known. The fact that decreased HR variability is due predominantly to a reduction in underlying vagal tone has been documented by several studies.10,15,16Furthermore, in experimental studies attenuation of vagal activity predisposed to malignant ventricular arrhythmias,27 while vagal stimulation was found to be protective.28,29 However, the relative role of parasympathetic and sympathetic effects on HR variability remains to be fully elucidated.
Data limitations: This study is limited by the relatively small sample size and thus requires verification with larger series. Although the present data expand the role of HR variability as a prognostic indicator in patients with coronary heart disease, its value in other cardiovascular disorders is unknown. An analysis of the components of HR variability2,30 might also provide information not obtainable with present methodology. Finally, the data do not provide insight into the mechanisms of HR variability. Further studies addressing these issues are needed.
