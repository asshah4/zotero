Objective Fibroscan (FS) is a reliable noninvasive method for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver disease. However, there is no clear consensus with respect to the best FS cut-off values for use in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to compare the performance of FS and different biochemical markers in ALD patients; (b) to assess the best FS cut-off values for the prediction of ﬁbrosis stage in our ALD population; and (c) to assess the inﬂuence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values on FS. Patients and methods This retrospective study included 135 consecutive and compensated ALD patients who underwent liver biopsy between November 2006 and March 2012 at Erasme Hospital. FS, Fibrotest, FIB-4, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and Forns’ scores were tested in all patients. Results The diagnostic accuracy of FS was 0.89 (95% conﬁdence interval: 0.83–0.95) for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and 0.93 (95% conﬁdence interval 0.90–0.97) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. FS performed better than Fibrotest (0.81 and 0.88), APRI (0.65 and 0.75), Forns’ (0.64 and 0.78), and FIB-4 (0.70 and 0.73). The optimal cut-off values of liver stiffness (LS) for predicting METAVIR ﬁbrosis stage F ≥ 3 and F4 disease were 10.3 and 18.0 kPa, respectively. AST showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation with LS (r = 0.24, P = 0.001). However, exclusion of patients with AST more than 50 IU/l only lowered the LS cut-off for the diagnosis of F4 (14 vs. 18.0 kPa). Conclusion FS is currently the most reliable noninvasive method for the diagnosis of advanced liver ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis in ALD.

Introduction
Chronic alcohol abuse is a major public health problem. Alcohol is the third leading cause of premature death in the world, representing 4% of global mortality [1]. Alcoholinduced liver injury is the most prevalent cause of liver disease worldwide. It affects 10–20% of the population [2]. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a complex disease with a wide spectrum of presentations ranging from simple steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) that can lead to

progressive ﬁbrosis, cirrhosis, and ﬁnally hepatocellular carcinoma [3]. Among individuals consuming 50 g or more of ethanol per day, the vast majority will develop steatosis, whereas only a minority (15–40%) will develop liver ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis [4,5]. In addition to the amount and the pattern of alcohol consumption, clinical factors such as sex, obesity, and, more recently, genetic factors, have been identiﬁed to explain, at least partly, the discrepancies in susceptibility to the development of ﬁbrosis [6,7]. Early diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis before the onset of end-stage liver disease is of major interest to motivate patients to decrease or, ideally, interrupt alcohol consumption, and to implement speciﬁc screening procedures for the complications of cirrhosis. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the assessment of liver ﬁbrosis in ALD patients. However, it is an invasive procedure with rare, but potentially life-threatening complications [8]. In addition, it is poorly accepted by patients, expensive, and the accuracy of liver biopsy in assessing ﬁbrosis is limited owing to sampling error and interobserver variability [9–12]. For all these reasons, development of a noninvasive diagnostic approach is of great interest in ALD patients.
Several noninvasive laboratory tests have been developed to assess liver ﬁbrosis combining different biomarkers, such as the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) [13,14], Forns’ index [15], FIB-4 [16],

and Fibrotest (FT) [17,18]. Although initially designed for patients with chronic hepatitis C, some of these tests also seem promising in patients with ALD [5,19]. More recently, Fibroscan (FS), a noninvasive technique involving ultrasound-based transient elastography, has enabled evaluation of liver ﬁbrosis by measuring liver stiffness (LS) [20]. This technique has been validated widely in hepatitis C virus patients [21–23], but has not yet been studied extensively in ALD [24–28]. In particular, no clear consensus with respect to the best LS cut-offs for the degree of liver ﬁbrosis exists in ALD. Moreover, the best noninvasive tool to diagnose advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis in ALD patients is currently unknown.
The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to evaluate and compare the performance of LS and different biochemical markers for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis in ALD patients; (b) to assess the best LS cutoff values for the prediction of extensive ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis in this population; and (c) to study the possible inﬂuence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values on LS.
Patients and methods
Patients
This was a retrospective study carried out on patients who underwent liver biopsy at Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium, between November 2006 and March 2012. Patients treated during this period who had compensated ALD, were 18 years of age or older, had alcohol intake more than 50 g/day for more than 5 years, were candidates for a liver biopsy (by the transcutaneous or the transjugular technique) for assessment of ALD, and had biochemical scores from APRI, FIB-4, Forns’ index, and FT testing, and LS measurement included in their record were included and recruited consecutively. Exclusion criteria included the presence of concomitant liver disease, presence of ascites and/or encephalopathy, and HIV positivity. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Erasme Hospital.
Study methodology
The following data were recorded: age, sex, BMI and waist circumference, daily alcohol intake, and the presence or absence of clinical or imaging (ultrasound, tomodensitometry, or MRI) signs of chronic liver disease. Patients with unequivocal clinical and/or imaging signs of cirrhosis were deﬁned as cirrhotic patients, irrespective of the result of the liver biopsy. The following laboratory parameters were measured: prothrombin time, platelet counts, total bilirubin, AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, α-2 macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin, albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, hepatitis virus B, hepatitis virus C, HIV status, and autoantibodies.

pathologist blinded to the other results. Liver ﬁbrosis was staged using the METAVIR classiﬁcation: F0: absence of ﬁbrosis, F1: minimal portal ﬁbrosis without septa, F2: portal ﬁbrosis, F3: septal ﬁbrosis, and F4: cirrhosis [29–31].
Hepatic steatosis was evaluated according to the percentage of hepatocytes containing fatty vacuoles. ASH was deﬁned by the association of hepatocyte ballooning, Mallory’s hyaline, and neutrophil inﬁltration [3,32].
Serum ﬁbrosis markers
FT [17,18,22], APRI, Forns’ index, and FIB-4 scores were calculated according to published procedures. The APRI score was calculated as follows [13,14,33]: AST/(upper limit of normal) × 100/platelet count (109/l). Forns’ score was calculated using this algorithm [15]: 7.811–3.131 × ln [platelet count (109/l)] + 0.781 × ln[GGT (IU/l)] + 3.467 × ln [age (years)]–0.014 × [cholesterol (mg/dl)]. The FIB-4 score was calculated as follows [16]: [age (years) × AST (IU/l)]/[number of platelets (109 l) × ALT (IU/l)(1/2)].
Liver stiffness measurements
LS measurement was performed using FS (Echosens, Paris, France) by an experienced operator. Details of the technical description and examination procedure have been described previously [20]. Ten successful acquisitions were performed for each patient. The success rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of successful acquisitions over the total number of acquisitions. The ﬁnal result was the median of all valid measurements performed. Only results obtained with 10 successful acquisitions and a success rate of at least 60% were considered reliable. Results were expressed in kilopascal.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using Statistix9 software (Statistix 9.0: analytical software, Tallahassee, Florida, USA) for descriptive, correlation, and nonparametric analyses. Variables with a normal distribution are represented as mean ± SE. Skewed variables are presented as the median (interquartile range). Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient was used. Box plots were drawn to show the distribution of the observed LS values, FT, FIB-4, Forns’, and APRI scores as a function of the METAVIR ﬁbrosis stage. To compare skewed variables, we used the Mann–Whitney U-test. The diagnostic performance of FS and the different biochemical scores were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and by calculating the area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (AUROC). The optimal LS cut-offs for the detection of advanced ﬁbrosis (F ≥ 3) and cirrhosis (F4) were determined from ROC curves according to a sensitivity of at least 90% and then choosing the best speciﬁcity. ROC curves were determined using the SPSS software (SPSS 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA).

Histological analysis
Liver biopsies were performed either by the percutaneous or by the transjugular technique, enabling measurement of the portosystemic gradient. Specimens were ﬁxed, embedded in parafﬁn, sliced, and stained with hematoxylin–eosin and picrosirius coloration and examined by one experienced

(70%), mean age 56 ± 0.9 years. The median daily alcohol intake was 70 g/day (IQR: 50–150).
A total of 83 patients (61%) underwent a transjugular liver biopsy, enabling portosystemic gradient measurement [median 7 mmHg (4–13.5)]. The mean liver biopsy length was 19.9 ± 0.8 mm. Fifty-seven patients (42%) had cirrhosis (41 patients with histological features and 16 patients with unequivocal clinical and/or imaging signs). Histological features of ASH were observed in 40 patients (29.6%) (Table 2).
Liver stiffness measurements, biochemical ﬁbrosis markers, and comparison with liver histology
LS values measured using FS ranged from 3.4 to 75 kPa, with a median of 14.4 kPa. The mean success rate was 86.2 ± 17.9% (Table 1). Of 135 patients, 12 FS failures were reported. The results of the four biochemical scores of liver ﬁbrosis are presented in Table 1.
Portal hypertension, assessed by the portosystemic gradient, was correlated positively with LS measures (r = 0.67, P < 0.0001). LS did not correlate signiﬁcantly with steatosis (r = − 0.0116, P = 0.205). For the 40 patients with histological signs of ASH, LS values were signiﬁcantly higher compared with those without ASH histological features [median 28 kPa (12–55.6) vs. 12.5 kPa (7.6–28.9), P = 0.0005].
Transient elastography using the FS was correlated signiﬁcantly with METAVIR ﬁbrosis stage (r = 0.68, P < 0.00001) as were FT, FIB-4, APRI, and Forns’ index (r = 0.5, P < 0.00001; r = 0.357, P = 0.001; r = 0.355, P = 0.001; r = 0.26, P = 0.004, respectively). Box plots show the distribution of observed LS (Fig. 1), FT, FIB-4, Forns’ index, and APRI values (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/ EJGH/A27) as a function of METAVIR ﬁbrosis stage.

Comparison between Fibroscan and serum markers for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis
We compared AUROCs for FT, APRI, FIB-4, and Forns’ index ﬁbrosis scores with LS scores using FS for the diagnosis of F ≥ 3 and F4 ﬁbrosis. AUROCs are presented in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1 (Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A27). For advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis, LS AUROCs were higher than the other biochemically derived scores. Among the four biochemically derived scores, FT appears to be the most efﬁcient, with AUROCs of 0.81 and 0.88 for advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis, respectively. Combining FS and the best biochemical score, that is FT, did not improve AUROC compared with using FS only (0.89 and 0.93 for F ≥ 3 and F4, respectively).

Determination of the inﬂuence of aspartate aminotransferase values on liver stiffness cut-offs
AST values correlate positively with LS (r = 0.24 P = 0.007). LS was signiﬁcantly higher in patients with AST more than 100 IU/l [31.6 (9.6–54.6) kPa vs. 13.7 (8.1–32.4) kPa, P = 0.036]. Similarly, LS in patients with AST more than 50 IU/l was signiﬁcantly higher than those with AST less than or equal to 50 IU/l [18.4 (9.1–48.0) vs. 11.6 (7.6–28.4), P = 0.015]. Table 4 summarizes LS AUROCs for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis after the exclusion of patients with AST more than 100 IU/l and AST more than 50 IU/l. AUROC values did not increase after the exclusion of patients with AST more than 100 IU/l or AST more than 50 IU/l. The optimal LS cut-offs selected for the diagnosis of F ≥ 3 did not change after the exclusion of patients with AST more than 100 IU/l or AST more than 50 IU/l. However, the optimal LS cut-off selected for the diagnosis of F4 was lower after the exclusion of patients with AST more than 50 IU/l, 14 kPa instead of 18.0 kPa.

Discussion
This study conﬁrms that transient elastography using FS is a reliable diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis in ALD patients. Moreover, this study shows that FS performs better compared with biochemical scores such as FT, APRI, FIB-4, and Forns’ index.
The use of FS for the noninvasive diagnosis of liver ﬁbrosis has been validated widely in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C [21–23], and has become, in clinical practice, one of the tools most often used to guide the initiation of antiviral therapy decisions. Assessment of liver ﬁbrosis in patients with ALD has less practical consequences as the diagnosis of mild ﬁbrosis does not lead to a speciﬁc therapy. However, ignoring a diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis in such patients could lead to missed screening for hepatocellular carcinoma and portal hypertension [34]. As the aim of this study was to validate the efﬁcacy of transient elastography for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis in asymptomatic, heavy-drinking patients, patients with decompensated cirrhosis and severe alcoholic hepatitis were excluded. Overall, our ALD study population is comparable to those reported in other series in terms of age, sex, laboratory tests, and distribution of hepatic lesions on biopsy – 18% had grade F3 and 30% had F4 lesions [19,25–27].
AUROCs of 0.89 and 0.93 for the detection of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis reported in our study are similar to those reported in other series [24–27] and conﬁrm the effectiveness of this noninvasive technique. The cut-offs for F ≥ 3 and F4 were selected favoring a sensitivity of at least 90% for the best speciﬁcity. Thus,

using cut-offs of 10.3 kPa for F ≥ 3 and 18 kPa for F4, 98/123 (80%) and 108/123 (88%) patients of F ≥ 3 and F4, respectively, were correctly identiﬁed, and 15% of F ≥ 3 and 8% of F4 were false positives, and would not beneﬁt from screening for potential complications of cirrhosis. Only 5% of F ≥ 3 and 4% of F4 patients were false negatives.
Even if liver biopsy remains the gold standard for assessing liver ﬁbrosis in ALD patients, its accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis is limited, with an underestimation of cirrhosis in up to 20% of cases in the different series [9–12] and 12% in our study.
Our cut-offs for diagnosing F ≥ 3 and F4 in our ALD cohort are higher than those reported for chronic hepatitis C [21–23] and are close to those reported previously in ALD, as summarized in Table 5 [24–28].
In this study, we have also compared the diagnostic accuracy of FS to four biochemical scores frequently used to assess liver ﬁbrosis in chronic liver diseases including FT, APRI, Forns’ index, and FIB-4. The performance of FS for diagnosing advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis was slightly better than the performance of the noninvasive laboratory scores tested, as reported in other studies [26]. Diagnostic values of APRI, Forns’, and FIB-4 scores are worse, for the diagnosis of both advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis compared with FT, which appeared to be the best biochemical marker in our series, as already reported in the literature [19]. In addition to its diagnostic performance in the screening of ﬁbrosis [35], FT might be useful in predicting liver-related mortality in alcoholic patients [19].
The combination of FS with FT (which appeared to be the best biochemical marker in our series) did not improve diagnostic performance relative to FS alone, with no improvement in the AUROCs for ﬁbrosis stages F ≥ 3 and F4.
We ﬁnally examined whether aspartate transaminase levels impacted the performance of FS, as reported previously [24]. Although we found a positive correlation between FS and AST levels, exclusion of patients with AST

more than 100 IU/l or AST more than 50 IU/l did not signiﬁcantly impact the diagnostic accuracy of FS, except for the optimal cut-off for diagnosing cirrhosis, which decreased to 14.4 kPa from 18 kPa when patients with AST more than 50 IU/l were excluded. The other factors that correlated with FS were portal hypertension assessed by HVPG measurement and the presence of histologic signs of alcoholic hepatitis, as underlined in previous studies [25–27].
A limitation of our study is its retrospective design. Another limitation is that speciﬁc histological vascular lesions encountered in ALD [30,36] were not described by the pathologist. It would have been interesting to examine the correlation between those histological features and FS values. A ﬁnal limitation is the absence of evaluation of FS accuracy in ALD patients following alcohol withdrawal as previous studies suggest that LS values (over a week) decrease rapidly after alcohol withdrawal [24,37]. Nevertheless, most of the patients included in our study were heavy drinkers, and alcohol withdrawal, even for a short period of time, is difﬁcult to achieve in this population.
In conclusion, this study conﬁrms that FS is a powerful noninvasive method for the diagnosis of advanced ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis in ALD patients. These results will help clinicians to better identify ALD patients who need screening for cirrhosis complications and could reinforce the management of alcohol abuse.
