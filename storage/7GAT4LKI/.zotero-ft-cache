Who Wrote This Paper? Basics of Authorship and Ethical Issues

Scientiﬁc integrity encompasses a variety of processes related to scientiﬁc research and reporting. True scientiﬁc integrity requires that the researcher or author be objective, complete, fair, and accurate in reporting results of scientiﬁc work. Integrity also requires that appropriate credit be given in authorship to all who participated sufﬁciently, and that only those who participated sufﬁciently be recognized. It is only through the avenues of scientiﬁc integrity and appropriate application of publication ethics that the accurate reporting of science can be accomplished.
The recent scandals in the New York Times and other newspapers involving plagiarism and unethical publication practices have brought some of the issues of publication ethics to the public eye. Additionally, many readers of this journal have had personal experiences involving inappropriate authorship designations, plagiarism, or some other breach of ethical authorship. The commonplace nature of such problems serves to emphasize the need for improvement in behavior and self-policing as a profession with aspirations to ethical and appropriate publication of scientiﬁc manuscripts.
WHO IS AN AUTHOR?
No one need doubt who is the author of Gone With the Wind. Works of ﬁction generally are the creation of an individual author. In scientiﬁc publications (which we hope are not works of ﬁction), authorship is conferred not only for writing the words, but also for signiﬁcant involvement in the work. In these projects, appropriate authorship determination includes decisions both about who is an author and about the most appropriate order of authorship. Hewitt recognized the difﬁculties inherent to authorship designation as early as 1957, stating:
Authorship cannot be conferred; it may be undertaken by one who will shoulder the responsibility that goes with it. To a responsible writer, an article, with his name on it, is the highest product of his mind and art, his property. . .founded in his character and evidence of it. . .The reader of a report issued by two or more authors has a right to assume that each author has some authoritative knowledge of the subject, that each contributed to the investigation, and that each labored on the report to the extent of weighing every word and quantity in it.1
More recently, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors suggested three necessary conditions for authorship (all three must be met): conception and

design, drafting or revising the manuscript, and ﬁnal approval of the version to be published.2,3 Some suggest that any coauthor should be able to take responsibility for the entire paper.4 Others suggest that all authors should have contributed in a meaningful and identiﬁable way to the design, performance, analysis, and reporting of the work.5 Another criterion for authorship uses anyone who has contributed something essential to the conclusions of the manuscript.3 As evidence of recognition of the numerous difﬁculties inherent to authorship designation, several journals recently have issued statements about the importance of appropriate authorship designation.5–10 Many journals require written designation of contributions of each author, and signatures accepting responsibility for the manuscript. This process allows each contributor to specify his or her actual involvement with speciﬁc parts of the project. Academic Emergency Medicine will begin this acknowledgment soon.
The ﬁrst author of any manuscript plays a special role. He or she makes the decision about who will be included as an author, the order of authorship, and any other credits and acknowledgments. The ﬁrst author has the ultimate responsibility for the content and design of the manuscript, as well as determination of authorship and order listed.11 Other authors should have participated in a meaningful way to the development, planning, execution, and/or writing of the manuscript. Often, but not always, the last author is one who participated in a supervisory role. One interesting study demonstrated great variability in the relative contributions of non-ﬁrst authors.12
INAPPROPRIATE INCLUSION OF AUTHORS (WHY NOT ADD ‘‘EVERYONE’S’’ NAME?)
Over the past decades, the average number of authors on scientiﬁc manuscripts has dramatically increased.13 This increase is disproportionately high in the life sciences.14 Numerous articles name authors who do not meet appropriate authorship criteria.15 The reasons for this increase may include such factors as increased pressure to publish in the academic environment and increased pressure by superiors to be included.16
Some authors inappropriately include as authors people who have not contributed signiﬁcantly to the work. This may be related to feelings of obligation to

superiors, attempts to appease colleagues or acquaintances, or the pressures to publish in order to be promoted. Inappropriate inclusion of additional names may also be the result of ignorance of appropriate authorship criteria, or lack of awareness of other avenues of recognizing contributions, such as acknowledgments within the manuscript.
Learners or junior faculty may ﬁnd it awkward when approached by superiors who have an expectation of inappropriate authorship designation. Though challenging at times, the responsibility of authoritative and fair decisions about authorship should be directly communicated to all involved. The ﬁrst author has the opportunity and responsibility to make all ﬁnal authorship determinations. He or she should remember that there are several negative ramiﬁcations of inappropriate author inclusion, such as dilution of credit resulting from appropriate authors, or inappropriate inﬂation of credentials or curriculum vitae.17,18
INAPPROPRIATE OMISSION OF AUTHORS
Some authors mistakenly omit recognition of an author who made a substantial contribution to the manuscript. Ranging from ﬂagrant plagiarism to inadvertent oversight, these types of errors can be destructive to careers, interpersonal relationships, and future collaborative efforts. Once again, the ﬁrst author must assume responsibility of the appropriate inclusion and recognition of all who made signiﬁcant contributions, whether as an author or as a contributor who may be recognized as an acknowledgment.
CONCLUSIONS
Academic Emergency Medicine is committed to publication integrity and intellectual honesty. Because journal editors cannot realistically police individual manuscripts and author designations, the responsibility falls upon each author to ensure the scientiﬁc integrity of the manuscript, including appropriate credit for all authors and contributors, and avoiding inappropriate inclusion of those who do not meet

authorship criteria.—Catherine A.
