abstract
The heart receives both a left and right sympathetic innervation. Currently there is no description of an in vitro whole heart preparation for comparing the inﬂuence of each sympathetic supply on cardiac function. The aim was to establish the viability of using an in vitro model to investigate the effects of left and right sympathetic chain stimulation (LSS/RSS). For this purpose the upper sympathetic chain on each side was isolated and bipolar stimulating electrodes were attached between T2–T3 and electrically insulated from surrounding tissue in a Langendorff innervated rabbit heart preparation (n= 8). Heart rate (HR) was investigated during sinus rhythm, whilst dromotropic, inotropic and ventricular electrophysiological effects were measured during constant pacing (250 bpm). All responses exhibited linear increases with increases in stimulation frequency (2–10 Hz). The change in HR was larger during RSS than LSS (Pb 0.01), increasing by 78± 9 bpm and 49± 8 bpm respectively (10 Hz, baseline; 145 ± 7 bpm). Left ventricular pressure was increased from a baseline of 50± 4 mm Hg, by 22± 5 mm Hg (LSS, 10 Hz) and 4 ± 1 mm Hg (RSS, 10 Hz) respectively (Pb 0.001). LSS, but not RSS, caused a shortening of basal and apical monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90). We demonstrate that RSS exerts a greater effect at the sinoatrial node and LSS at the left ventricle. The study conﬁrms previous experiments on dogs and cats, provides quantitative data on the comparative inﬂuence of right and left sympathetic nerves and demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and stimulating the ipsilateral cardiac sympathetic supply in an in vitro innervated rabbit heart preparation.

1. Introduction
The sympathetic ﬁbres, which innervate the heart, arise from the level of T1–T5 of the thoracic vertebrae and are distributed through the inferior cervical, middle cervical, stellate and mediastinal ganglia (Randall and Rohse, 1956; Hopkins and Armour, 1989; Armour, 2008) on both right and left sides. The postganglionic sympathetic ﬁbres converge at the cardiac plexus and from there innervate the sinoatrial node (SAN), the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the atrial/ventricular myocardium (Hopkins and Armour, 1984; Armour, 2008). The effects of denervation (stellectomy) or sympathetic nerve stimulation on the contractile performance and electrical properties of the myocardium are described both in traditional in vivo studies in dog and cat (Sonnenblick et al., 1963; Vassalle et al., 1968; Spear and Moore, 1973; Wilde et al., 2008), and in isolated heart preparations utilising adrenoceptor agonists (Feinberg and Katz, 1958). The known effects of increased sympathetic

activity are an increase in heart rate (HR, positive chronotropy), greater force of contraction (positive inotropy), enhanced relaxation (positive lusitropy) and reduced delay at the AVN (positive dromotropy). Evidence from studies in anaesthetised dogs and cats and in conscious animals indicates that there are differences in the functional and electrophysiological responses of the heart to unilateral left and right sided nerve stimulation or denervation (Anzola and Rushmer, 1956; Randall and Rohse, 1956; Yanowitz et al., 1966; Geis and Kaye, 1968; Haws and Burgess;, 1978; Ardell et al., 1988; Priori et al., 1988; Zaza et al., 1991). This heterogeneity has been well documented in extensive studies on anaesthetised dogs in Randall's lab and strongly indicates a dominant inﬂuence of right sympathetic innervations on rate whilst the left sympathetic innervation primarily inﬂuences ventricular contractility (Randall and Rohse, 1956; Randall et al., 1963; Randall et al., 1968; Randall, 1984; Ardell et al., 1988). In accord with these data, the left sympathetic has a greater inﬂuence on ventricular action potential duration and repolarisation and as a consequence is strongly implicated in the generation of left ventricular arrhythmias, as has been well documented by studies in anaesthetised cats (Zaza et al., 1991) and in conscious animals (Schwartz et al., 1984).
Studies on the autonomic control of cardiac function have traditionally utilised in vivo models where autonomic nerves can be stimulated

directly, or in vitro preparations using mimetics (both natural and synthetic) of sympathetic or parasympathetic neurotransmitters. Both approaches have a number of advantages and the use of the former has clearly demonstrated a distinct differential inﬂuence of left and right neural innervations on cardiac function. However, for the purposes of detailed analysis of the neuro-myogenic mechanisms there may be a number of draw-backs to each approach. In vivo studies are confounded by circulating hormones and cardiac afferent induced reﬂexes as well as changes secondary to haemodynamic reﬂexes. Furthermore the level of background activity in the sympathetic nerves can vary considerably in conscious or anaesthetised animals. Such factors may have contributed to a high degree of variability in published data to date (Yanowitz et al., 1966). In vitro preparations utilising pharmacological and chemical agonists, such as isoprenaline, lack the targeted approach of direct nerve stimulation, do not take into account the natural heterogeneity of innervation in the heart and suffer from the toxic consequences of many of these agents (Rona et al., 1959; Rona, 1985).
In 2001, our group developed an in vitro dual innervated (sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions) Langendorff perfused rabbit heart preparation which circumvents circulatory inﬂuences and underlying autonomic tone whilst preserving the effects of autonomic innervation to the heart. This preparation has since been extensively characterised demonstrating classical responses to both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve stimulation and has yielded a number of important observations on their actions and new mechanistic insights (Ng et al., 2001; Brack et al., 2004; Brack et al., 2006; Brack et al., 2007; Mantravadi et al., 2007; Ng et al., 2007; Brack et al., 2009; Ng et al., 2009; Brack et al., 2010). These studies with the dual innervated rabbit preparation have relied upon direct stimulation of sympathetic neurones within the spinal cord that supply both right and left stellate ganglia and as such do not account for effects of differential sympathetic outﬂow arising from the left and right sympathetic chains. Therefore, the inﬂuence of right and left cardiac sympathetic supply has not been tested in this model, and this is necessary if we are to use the model to investigate the role of heterogeneous sympathetic innervation in cardiac arrhythmogenesis.
The aim of this study was to modify our original innervated isolated heart preparation to allow for unilateral sympathetic chain stimulation and to quantify the differential functional effects of the two cardiac sympathetic nerve projections. The data conﬁrm previous conclusions in dog and cat on the functional heterogeneity of the left and right cardiac sympathetic nerves but also provide new quantitative information on the magnitude of the changes induced by either left or right preganglionic cardiac sympathetic nerves on dromotropism, inotropism and electrophysiological parameters of the left ventricle. It reports the ﬁrst functional evidence of the heterogeneity of sympathetic innervations in the rabbit heart. Additionally, the successful further development, achieving separate right and left sympathetic nerve stimulation in this isolated innervated rabbit heart preparation provides an essential step to enable a more controllable and quantiﬁable approach to studying mechanisms contributing to left ventricular arrhythmogenesis and changes in contractility.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental techniques
All procedures were undertaken after local ethics approval at the University of Leicester and were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act 1986 and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85–23, revised 1985).
2.2. Isolation and perfusion of hearts with intact autonomic innervations
The innervated isolated rabbit heart preparation was isolated and perfused as previously described (Ng et al., 2007). Brieﬂy adult male

New Zealand White rabbits (1.7–2.5 Kg, n = 8) were pre-medicated with ketamine (Ketaset, 10 mg/kg, Fort Dodge, Southampton, United Kingdom), medetomidine hydrochloride (Sedator, 0.2 mg/kg, Dechra, Shrewsbury, United Kingdom) and butorphanol (Torbugesic, 0.05 mg/kg, Fort Dodge Southampton, United Kingdom) (i.m.). 15–20 min later anaesthesia was induced by propofol (i.v., Rapinovet, Schering-Plough Animal Health, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom) and maintained for the remainder of surgery. Animals were intubated (tracheotomy) and breathing was regulated using a small animal ventilator at 60 breaths per minute of room air. The common carotid arteries were identiﬁed and isolated and the vagus nerves partially dissected free at the midcervical level. A midline incision exposed the rib cage allowing for dissection of the pectoral muscles and the isolation of the subclavian vessels. Animals were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone (Sagatal, Rhone Merieux, Harlow, UK; 800 mg, i.v.) together with 1000 U heparin (i.v.). The thoracic cavity was opened and the anterior portion of the ribcage removed exposing the mediastinal contents. The descending aorta was identiﬁed and cannulated following which hearts were perfused with ice cold Tyrode solution, to reduce metabolic rate. The vertebral column was cut at the level of the 12th thoracic and 1st cervical vertebrae and the preparation was dissected from the surrounding tissues for Langendorff perfusion.
2.3. Langendorff perfusion
The preparation was perfused at a constant rate of 100 ml/min in Langendorff mode with an oxygenated Tyrode solution of the following composition (mM): Na+ 138, K+ 4, Ca2+ 1.8, Mg2+ 1.0, HCO3− 24, H2PO4− 0.4, Cl− 121, glucose 11 (pH 7.4 — bubbling with O2/CO2 — 95/5%, temperature maintained at 37 °C). A catheter (3F, Portex, Kent, United Kingdom) was inserted through the apex of the left ventricle for drainage of ﬂuid returning to the left ventricle (LV) from the thebesian veins. A ﬂuid ﬁlled latex balloon was inserted into the left ventricle, through an incision in the left atrial appendage, and used for the recording of left ventricular pressure (LVP) through a pressure transducer (MLT0380/D, ADI instruments Ltd, Charlgrove, United Kingdom). Aortic perfusion pressure was recorded through a second pressure transducer in series with the perfusion system.
2.4. Left and right sympathetic chain isolation and stimulation
The left and right sympathetic chains run adjacent to the spinal column and were ﬁrst visualised through careful dissection of the connective tissues at the level of the 4th or 5th ribs with a Zeiss dissecting microscope. Following this the chains were dissected up to the level of the 1st and 2nd intercostal space close to the upper intercostal artery, which runs inferiorly to the chains in this region, and was ligated and cut. A drain was inserted through the thoracic wall to aid ﬂuid drainage in this region. A pair of custom made silver electrodes (Advent Research Materials, Oxford, United Kingdom: 0.5 mm diameter) was placed around each chain so that they spaced from just below the 2nd and up to the 3rd rib ensuring adequate clearance from the surrounding connective tissues. These electrodes were then electrically isolated from the surrounding tissues using quick setting dental cement (Klass 4 dental cement, Klass 4 dental supplies). Fig. 1A shows a diagrammatic representation of the experimental model and Fig. 1B a representation of the electrode positioning on the sympathetic chain.
Constant voltage stimulators (SD9, Grass Instruments, AstroMedInc., Slough, United Kingdom) were used to stimulate the left and right sympathetic chains separately. Once the sympathetic chains were isolated and the dental cement had set, each sympathetic chain was stimulated using incremental voltages from 0.1 V to 3 V at 5 Hz (2 ms pulse width) until there was an increase in both LVP (of 3–4 mm Hg) and heart rate (of 3–4 bpm). The voltage that caused an increase in both parameters was deﬁned as the threshold voltage. The remainder of the protocols was performed at twice the threshold voltage.

2.5. Cardiac electrical recording and pacing
A pair of platinum electrodes (Grass Instruments, Slough, United Kingdom) were inserted into the right atrial (RA) appendage for recording of atrial electrograms. The recording of atrial electrograms during right ventricular (RV) pacing allows retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction analysis to be made. The same wires were used for atrial pacing to examine antegrade atrio-ventricular conduction (see below). Custom-made suction electrodes were used to record monophasic action potentials (MAPs), as previously described (19), from the epicardial surface of the left ventricular free wall simultaneously at the apex and the base and analysed using custom made software (Dr Francis Burton, Glasgow University, Glasgow, UK).
2.6. Protocols
Left and right sympathetic stimulations (left SS and right SS respectively) were carried out at 2 Hz (Low), 5 Hz (Medium) and 10 Hz (High) frequencies following the protocol below with a minimum period of rest between stimulation of 3 min:
2.6.1. Chonotropic effects of left and right SS Paravertebral chains were stimulated during intrinsic sinus rhythm
to determine effects on chronotropy (HR). To analyse the dynamic

change in HR, the duration from the start of nerve stimulation to a 1% increase in HR was also measured.
2.6.2. Ventricular effects of left and right SS
2.6.2.1. Inotropy. Hearts were paced via the right ventricle at 250 bpm to determine effects of SS on LVP in order to assess inotropic changes. LVP was measured at baseline and during the plateau phase of the response to SS (i.e. during the new steady state). To analyse the dynamic change in LVP, the duration from the start of nerve stimulation to a 1% increase in LVP was also measured.
2.6.2.2. Ventricular electrophysiological parameters. Apical and basal MAPs were recorded and effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation were measured at 90% decay of the MAP voltage (MAPD90) at baseline and steady state during constant pacing (250 bpm).
2.6.3. Dromotropic effects of left and right SS RA electrograms were recorded along with all other parameters to
measure dromotropic changes during constant ventricular pacing as measured by retrograde ventriculo-atrial conduction. This was obtained by measuring the delay from the RV pacing spike to the atrial electrogram.
The dromotropic effects during left and right SS were also investigated during pacing at the right atrium (250 bpm). This gives a measure of antegrade atrioventricular conduction and was calculated as

the time delay from the atrial stimulation spike to the beginning of the monophasic action potential measured from the LV free wall.
2.7. Signals measurements and analysis
All pressure and electrical signals obtained from the preparation were recorded with a PowerLab 16/30 system (ADInstruments Ltd) and digitised at 1 kHz using Chart software (ADInstruments Ltd) with the data stored and displayed on a personal desktop computer. The left SS and right SS stimulus signals were also recorded on the same system as well as the timing and duration of the stimuli. Instantaneous intrinsic sinus heart rate and peak LVP were measured throughout the experiment as a guide for maximal and steady state effects. Heart rate measurements were taken from an average of 10 cardiac cycles, whilst all other signals were averaged during constant ventricular or atrial pacing from a 30 second period during steady state. Within each branch of SS, one-way ANOVA was used to compare the parameters between baseline values and at steady state during SS, with Bonferroni post-hoc tests used to determine the comparisons that were signiﬁcantly different. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyse the changes in heart rate to demonstrate 1) any differential effects of left and right sympathetic stimulation (i.e. left vs. right or laterality), 2) the effects of frequency and 3) any interaction between frequency and laterality on these changes. P b 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. All ﬁgures and illustrations within this manuscript were produced using OriginLab 8.5 (Northampton, USA) and Corel DRAW Graphics Suite 11 (Maidenhead, United Kingdom).
3. Results
Fig. 1B illustrates the typical changes seen in HR and LVP during concurrent high intensity left and right SS. The differential effects of

left and right SS are clearly demonstrated. Left SS produced more prominent changes in LVP when compared to right SS whereas there was a greater increase in HR with right SS when compared with left SS. The effects of left and right SS on HR and LVP are quantiﬁed independently (below) using the previously described experimental protocols (see subheading 2.6).
3.1. Effect of left and right sympathetic stimulation on heart rate
Data illustrating the effect of left and right SS on beat-by-beat intrinsic sinus heart rate and the percentage change in heart rate from the start of nerve stimulation in a typical experiment is shown in Fig. 2A–D. Left SS and right SS induced a monotonic increase in HR to a plateau that was maintained until the cessation of nerve stimulation (Fig. 2A–B). The change in HR during SS was dependent upon the frequency of nerve stimulation demonstrating a larger change during higher frequency SS (Fig. 2A–B). HR changes were greater during right than during left SS (Fig. 2A–B). Similarly the dynamic change in heart rate (i.e. time taken for a 1% change from baseline values (lag)) was dependent upon the frequency of stimulation and location of SS (i.e. faster changes during right SS), as shown in Fig. 2C–D.
Mean data conﬁrming these ﬁndings are shown in Fig. 3. Both left (Fig. 3A) and right SS (Fig. 3B) induced signiﬁcant increases in HR at all frequencies. HR responses were dependent upon the frequency of stimulation (Fig. 3C, P b 0.01) with right SS producing a larger increase in HR compared to left SS (Fig. 3C, P b 0.01). The HR lag time was found to be shorter with right SS (P b 0.001) and with higher frequency of nerve stimulation in both left and right SS (Fig. 3D, P b 0.001). Interaction test was signiﬁcant (Pb 0.05) demonstrating that frequency of SS had an effect on laterality, with data suggesting that differences between left and right SS were more obvious at low frequency of stimulation.

3.2. Effect of left and right sympathetic stimulation on LV functional and electrophysiological parameters
3.2.1. Functional parameters
3.2.1.1. LVP. Effects of left and right SS on ventricular inotropy were examined during constant ventricular pacing. Raw data illustrating the effect of left and right SS on continuous perfusion pressure, left ventricular pressure and peak LVP in a typical experiment is shown in Fig. 4. LVP responses to left SS were bi-phasic consisting of an initial increase to a peak response followed by a gradual decline to a new plateau (above that of baseline). Right SS was associated with less inotropic enhancement.
Mean data on LVP are illustrated in Fig. 5A–D. Both left (Fig. 5A, P b 0.001) and right SS (Fig. 5B, P b 0.001) produced a frequency dependent increase in LVP (Fig. 5C, P b 0.05). The increase in LVP in response to left SS was signiﬁcantly greater than that seen with right SS (Fig. 5C, P b 0.001). The time taken to reach a 1% change in LVP response (lag time) was also dependent on stimulation frequency during both left and right SS (Fig. 5D, P b 0.05). The lag time in the LVP increase was signiﬁcantly shorter during left SS than that seen during right SS (Fig. 5D, P b 0.05).
3.2.1.2. dP/dt. In keeping with the patterns noted in LVP, the rate of LVP development (dP/dtmax) was increased to a greater extent during left SS than during right SS (Fig. 6A–C, P b 0.05). A greater rate of ventricular pressure relaxation (dP/dtmin) was noted during left SS vs. right SS (Fig. 6D–E, P b 0.05).
3.2.1.3. LV end diastolic pressure and perfusion pressure. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure and aortic perfusion pressure did not change signiﬁcantly during either left SS or right SS stimulation (data not shown).

3.2.2. Electrophysiological parameters An example of the effect of left SS and right SS on left ventricular
MAPs recorded from the apex and basal region is illustrated in Fig. 7A. Left SS caused a frequency dependent shortening of both basal and apical MAPD90 (Fig. 7B–C). Right SS was not associated with any signiﬁcant change in MAPD90 in either basal or apical regions.
3.3. Effect of left and right sympathetic stimulation on antegrade and retrograde conduction through the atrioventricular node
Fig. 8 illustrates the effect of left SS and right SS on both retrograde (Fig. 8A) and antegrade (Fig. 8B) conduction through the AV node in a typical experiment. Both left and right SS were associated with a frequency dependent shortening of conduction time through the AVN during ventricular (retrograde conduction) pacing (Fig. 8B–C P b 0.05). Comparison of left and right SS reveals that left SS resulted in a greater rate dependent shortening of retrograde conduction time through the AVN (Fig. 8C) than during right SS. Similar results were obtained during atrial pacing (data not shown).
4. Discussion
It is acknowledged that the existence of a functional heterogeneity between right and left sympathetic supplies to the heart is an old observation dating from the latter part of the 19th century (Boehm and Nussbaum, 1875). More recent experiments conducted in dogs and cats, have conﬁrmed and expanded this understanding (Randall, 1984; Schwartz et al., 1984). However, there has been no clear quantiﬁcation of the comparative actions of the two nerve supplies. To our knowledge the present study is the ﬁrst description of the differential functional effects of increasing levels of induced activity in left and right sided sympathetic innervations on cardiac contractile performance and electrophysiological properties, and furthermore the ﬁrst description in the isolated rabbit heart. We are aware that this is a

small step, but such quantitative data are a necessary prerequisite for future in vitro studies, using the isolated innervated rabbit heart model, into the role of heterogeneous sympathetic innervation in the

development of malignant cardiac arrhythmias. Our data show that nerves arising from the left sympathetic paravertebral chain have a greater inﬂuence on LV contractility, LV MAPD and conduction through

the AVN whereas nerves arising from the right sympathetic paravertebral chain have a more signiﬁcant effect on sinus rate. These responses were repeatable and did not show fatigue on repeated testing indicating that the preparation is sustainable over a period of time.
Whilst there is no previous histological or functional information on the relative innervations from the left and right sympathetic chains in the rabbit, unsurprisingly this is in accord with well documented in vivo studies in dog and cat (Randall, 1984; Schwartz et al., 1984). In the ﬁrst of such studies, Randall and Rohse (1956) reported that left stellate stimulation resulted in mainly inotropic enhancement (as assessed through alterations in systolic blood pressure) whilst right stellate stimulation was associated with both inotropic and chronotropic responses in vivo. Similarly Randall et al. (1963) reported on the separation of inotropic and chronotropic inﬂuences between sympathetic innervations derived from the left and right sympathetic chains. Studies in cats provide similar conclusions in so far as they have shown that the right and left cardiac sympathetics have opposite effects on duration of repolarisation of left ventricular action potentials (Zaza et al., 1991).
4.1. Frequency dependence of sympathetic inﬂuence
The responses of the left ventricle to stimulation of the left or right sympathetic chains were frequency dependent probably reﬂecting

temporal summation of the preganglionic action potentials in the stellate ganglion (Birks et al., 1981). The rate of stimulation (2–10 Hz) of the sympathetic chain covers the range of ﬁring observed in preganglionic neurones in the third thoracic segment of anaesthetised rats and cats (Coote, 1988) although even higher rates up to 20 Hz have been recorded following application of glutamate in their vicinity (Coote et al., 1981). In the present study, all the cardiac muscle responses displayed a linear increase to a linear rise in frequency of stimulation of either the right or left sympathetic chains and these responses were preserved over the course of the experiment. However, such artiﬁcial stimulation does not mimic the patterns of activity observed in sympathetic preganglionic neurones. Bursts of activity, which is more the norm, could well lead to post-tetanic potentiation, as demonstrated in cardiac nerves of cats following preganglionic stimulation (Birks et al., 1981). Therefore, patterns of sympathetic chain stimulation could possibly give rise to greatly enhanced cardiac effects. The rabbit innervated heart model will provide a highly suitable preparation to study such effects in future studies.
4.2. Regional heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in the ventricle
There is evidence that sympathetic innervation of ventricular myocardium is heterogeneous with a greater proportion of sympathetic

nerve ﬁbres at basal than apical regions. We have also shown that both tyrosine hydroxylase and KCNQ1 protein expressions are greater in basal than in apical regions of the LV (Mantravadi et al., 2007). KCNQ1 is a potassium channel protein responsible for the slow delayed rectiﬁer current (IKs) and is thought to mediate the shortening of MAPD associated with β adrenoceptor stimulation. These ﬁndings may explain the enhanced effect of left SS on MAPD in basal regions when compared to apical regions in the present study. Previous investigators have described both a gradient of ventricular tissue catecholamine content from the base to the apex (Angelakos, 1965; Petch and Nayler, 1979) and a greater proportion of adrenergic nerve ﬁbres innervating basal regions of the human and canine myocardium (Dahlstrom et al., 1965; Kawano et al., 2003). Basal regions of the myocardium therefore have an increased propensity for MAPD shortening during sympathetic nerve stimulation although the contribution to this phenomenon from the differential expression of sympathetic nerves and/or key ion channels involved in ventricular repolarisation requires further investigation. It is worth noting that tissue from apical regions is more sensitive to adrenergic stimulation by noradrenaline infusion, which has been ascribed to greater β adrenoceptor content in this region (Mori et al.,

1993). This mechanism appears to provide some compensation for the sparse sympathetic innervation of this region. This is also supported by our previous study which shows that sympathetic nerve stimulation and isoprenaline produced different effects on the direction of repolarisation in the isolated rabbit heart (Mantravadi et al., 2007).
There is little detailed information on regional differences in the inotropic responses to left and right SS in the rabbit. Our functional data provide information on the net change in contractility across the entire ventricle rather than in speciﬁc cardiac regions. In addition MAPs were measured from the anterior portion of the LV free wall and so provide no information on any anterio-posterior variation of response during left or right SS. The existence of differences between anterior and posterior innervation from left and right sympathetic branches is controversial. Yanowitz et al. (1966) described how right stellate ganglionectomy resulted in a prolongation of the functional refractory period at the anterior ventricular surface. The opposite results were noted during left stellate ganglionectomy suggesting that unilateral alterations in sympathetic tone exert inﬂuences on the electrophysiological properties of discrete myocardial regions. Regional variations in the contractile response of the myocardium were seen by

Fig. 8. Effect of unilateral sympathetic stimulation on myocardial dromotropy during constant pacing. A) Raw data illustrating the effects of left and right sympathetic stimulation (SS) on both retrograde (A — left side) and antegrade (A — right side) conduction through the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). Retrograde conduction represents the time taken from a ventricular pacing stimulus to the detection of the atrial electrogram whilst antegrade conduction represents the time taken from an atrial pacing stimulus to the activation up-
stroke of a monophasic action potential recorded from the left ventricular free wall. The vertical lines demonstrate the activation time of the right atrial electrogram during left SS. Stimulation frequencies are low (2 Hz), medium (5 Hz) and high (10 Hz) frequencies. B–C) Mean data representing ventriculo-atrial conduction (VAC) at baseline and during left (B) and right (C) SS and the difference in VAC from baseline values during left and right SS (C). Data represent mean± SEM, n = 7. Baseline vs. steady state: +P b 0.05, ++P b 0.01, +++P b 0.001; frequency: ***P b 0.001; left vs. right: ##P b 0.01.

Norris et al. (1977) and lend support to the argument that ﬁbres arising from the left sympathetic chain innervate the posterior surface of the ventricle and that ﬁbres arising from the right sympathetic chain innervate the anterior ventricular surface. In contrast Randall et al. (1968) reported rich overlap of projections arising from the left and right stellate in all regions of the canine ventricle. This is supported by the experiments of Geis and Kaye (1968) combining electrical stimulation of the stellate ganglia and phenol destruction of pre-deﬁned regions of myocardial innervation. These issues may be best addressed by further studies utilising more modern investigative tools such as optical mapping. Such techniques will allow for a detailed understanding of the regional distribution of effects resulting from nerve stimulation.

4.3. Clinical implications
We have previously shown that adrenergic signalling increases the occurrence of triggered ventricular arrhythmias during direct sympathetic nerve stimulation (Ng et al., 2007). Experimental studies, clinical evidence and the ﬁndings from the present study suggest that differential innervation plays an important role in the susceptibility of the myocardium to malignant arrhythmias. Stimulation or ablation of either the right or left stellate innervation can have different effects on the ECG (Yanowitz et al., 1966), ventricular refractory periods (Haws and Burgess, 1978; Zaza et al., 1991), VFT (Schwartz et al., 1976a), and incidence of ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary

occlusion (Schwartz et al., 1976b). Right sided ganglionectomy or left sided sympathetic stimulation (left SS) is associated with an increased susceptibility to sustained ventricular tachycardia, a greater occurrence of delayed afterdepolarisations (DAD) and an augmentation of early-afterdepolarisation (EAD) amplitude whilst right sided sympathetic stimulation (right SS) has less effect on EAD amplitude than left SS (Hanich et al., 1988; Priori et al., 1988). Clinical studies have demonstrated that left cervicothoracic sympathectomy (an adaptation of the stellectomy procedure) signiﬁcantly reduces the occurrence of adverse cardiac events e.g. in patients with congenital long-QT syndrome who are refractory to standard β adrenoceptor antagonists (Schwartz et al., 2004). There is also evidence for the efﬁcacy of left cervicothoracic sympathectomy in the treatment of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Wilde et al., 2008).
The data presented in this manuscript provide evidence that functional consequence from heterogeneous sympathetic innervation exists in an experimental mammals other than the dog suggesting that this may be a common feature in all species. The model also provides an invaluable tool for the study of the mechanisms underlying cardiac arrhythmogenesis, especially ventricular ﬁbrillation. Of particular interest is the potential interaction between the regional differences in sympathetic innervation and regional differences in ion channel distribution (Schram et al., 2002). Together these may have serious implications in understanding arrhythmogenesis not only in cardiac disease states but also in conditions of sympathetic imbalance as a result of extreme emotional stress and central ischaemic stroke.
4.4. Study beneﬁts and limitations
The in vitro innervated rabbit heart preparation described in this manuscript provides a number of beneﬁts over traditional in vivo approaches allowing for the effects of nerve stimulation to be studied away from the potentially ‘confounding’ inﬂuences of tonic autonomic nervous activity, any stress induced reﬂex pathways, alterations in circulating hormones and changes in haemodynamic loads. The preparation also provides a novel opportunity for the study of local cardiocardiac reﬂex loops and the complex interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic systems, whilst the isolated nature of the preparation allows users to control and modify factors such as the coronary perfusion and to investigate the effects of drugs, hormones and other factors (e.g. oxygen content). It should be noted that the isolation of this preparation away from ‘confounding’ physiological factors may represent an over-simpliﬁcation of the complex process and interactions present in the intact animal and that the patterns of experimental nerve stimulation may not mimic those seen in vivo.
4.5. Conclusion
Data presented in this study of the rabbit heart conﬁrm the functional consequences of heterogeneous sympathetic innervation. It extends previous studies on dog and cat, showing a quantitative relationship between stimulation frequency and the effect on ventricular rate, on conduction, on force of contraction and relaxation, and on ventricular monophasic action potential duration. The results demonstrate that unilateral stimulation of sympathetic chains on right and left sides containing cardiac preganglionic nerves can be reliably achieved in an isolated innervated Langendorff rabbit heart preparation. The model presents a novel opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct effects of separate left and right sympathetic nerve stimulation (i.e. heterogeneous innervation) on arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the isolated rabbit heart without the inﬂuence of confounding neurohumoral, circulatory factors and autonomic reﬂexes.
