Diabetic Cardiomyopathy
An Update of Mechanisms Contributing to This Clinical Entity
Guanghong Jia, Michael A. Hill, James R. Sowers
Abstract: Heart failure and related morbidity and mortality are increasing at an alarming rate, in large part,
because of increases in aging, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. The clinical outcomes associated with heart failure are considerably worse for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes mellitus. In people with diabetes mellitus, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, has led to the descriptive terminology, diabetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy is increasing in parallel with the increase in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is initially characterized by myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and associated diastolic dysfunction, later by systolic dysfunction, and eventually by clinical heart failure. Impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevations in advanced glycation end products and collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities have all been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Molecular mechanisms linked to the underlying pathophysiological changes include abnormalities in AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, protein kinase C, microRNA, and exosome pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a contemporary view of these instigators of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as mechanistically based strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.   (Circ Res. 2018;122:624-638.

Diabetic cardiomyopathy is defined by the existence of abnormal myocardial structure and performance in the absence of other cardiac risk factors, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and significant valvular disease, in individuals with diabetes mellitus. It was first described in 19721 in postmortem pathological findings from 4 diabetic patients who manifested heart failure symptoms without evidence of coronary artery or valve disease and further confirmed in a 1974 Framingham Heart Study that demonstrated a higher incidence of heart failure in diabetic women (5-fold) and men (2.4-fold) after adjustment for other risk factors, such as age, coronary heart disease, and hypertension.2 In 2013, the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association,3 and the European Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes4 defined diabetic cardiomyopathy as a clinical condition of ventricular dysfunction that occurs in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus. In its early stages, diabetic cardiomyopathy includes a hidden subclinical period characterized

by structural and functional abnormalities, including left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cell signaling abnormalities. These pathophysiological changes of cardiac fibrosis and stiffness and associated subclinical diastolic dysfunction often evolve to heart failure with normal ejection fraction and eventual systolic dysfunction accompanied by heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. This review summarizes recent research exploring molecular mechanisms, structural and functional changes, and possible therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy. It also highlights unmet needs and future research directions to better understand fundamental molecular abnormalities that promote this cardiomyopathy.

Risk Factors for Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Hyperglycemia, systemic insulin resistance, and impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling are major clinical abnormalities in diabetes mellitus, and all are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (Figures 1 and 2).13 In a prospective national survey of patients with heart failure, 1811 individuals with and 2182 without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, glucose levels of 110 to 140, 140 to 200, and ≥200 mg/dL were associated with a 9%, 16%, and 53% increased mortality risk when compared with an admission blood glucose <110 mg/dL in patients with no pre-existing diabetes mellitus. There was a linear relationship between blood glucose level and long-term mortality in heart failure even in patients without a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. However, increased mortality risk was seen only in diabetics with glucose levels >200 mg/dL.14 In the UKPDS (The UK Prospective Diabetes Study) clinical study, a 1% reduction in hemoglobin A was associated with a 16% risk reduction
1c
for development of heart failure,12 suggesting that there is a time-related log-linear relationship between long-term glycemic control and heart failure risk. Furthermore, after 4 years of follow-up, a community-based study of 6814 people with no initial coronary artery disease demonstrated that increasing indices of metabolic syndrome tracked with increasing heart failure risk, with two thirds of these patients developing heart failure with normal ejection fraction.15 The contemporary increase in dietary refined carbohydrate, and especially fructose, consumption may also impact development of diabetic cardiomyopathy as described in more in detail in the molecular mechanisms component of this review.16

Study found that the incidence of heart failure was increased in both male and female diabetic patients when compared with age-matched individuals, and this association was independent of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease.2 One study found that the incidence of heart failure was higher in diabetic (39%) compared with nondiabetic (23%) patients, with a relative risk of 1.3 for developing heart failure after 43 months of observation.8 Further data derived from a population-based observational study in the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Strong Heart Stud,9 and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis10 demonstrated differences in LV mass and wall thickness and increased diastolic and systolic dysfunctions between diabetic patients and normal individuals. Meanwhile, in type 1 diabetes mellitus, each 1% increase in glycated hemoglobin A1c was linked to a 30% increase for risk of heart failure11 whereas in type 2 diabetes mellitus, each 1% rise in hemoglobin A1c levels was associated with an 8% increase in risk, independent of other risk factors, including obesity, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease,12 suggesting that graded increases in glycemia are a powerful promoter of heart failure in diabetic patients.

Figure1. Pathophysiological mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia induce cardiac insulin resistance and metabolic disorders that increase mitochondria dysfunction, oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), impairment of mitochondria Ca2+ handling, inflammation, activation of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, cardiomyocyte death, as well as microvascular dysfunction. These pathophysiological abnormalities promote cardiac stiffness, hypertrophy, and fibrosis, resulting in cardiac diastolic dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and heart failure.

Increased protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), and cyclic adenosine 5’-monophosphateresponsive element modulator (CREM) signaling, dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) and exosomes, and reduction of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, and nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) induce cardiac insulin resistance, subcellular component abnormalities, metabolic disorders, and structural changes, resulting in diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Evolution of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy to Clinical Heart Failure Diabetic cardiomyopathy is usually asymptomatic in the early stages of its evolution.13 One of the earliest manifestations is LV hypertrophy and decreased LV compliance characterized by impaired early diastolic filling, increased atrial filling, and prolonged isovolumetric relaxation.13 LV dilation and symptomatic heart failure occur after the development of systolic dysfunction.13 Indeed, our recent data support the notion that diastolic dysfunction, as observed by cine magnetic resonance imaging in rodents, is associated with impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling.17 Cardiomyocyte stiffness and hypertrophy, as well as myocardial fibrosis, all contribute to this cardiac abnormality (Figure 1). The Cardiovascular Health Study found that, in a cohort of 5201 men and women, the ventricular septal and left posterior myocardial wall thicknesses were greater in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic individuals and that this was associated with compromised systolic or diastolic function.18
There is a considerable body of epidemiological evidence that implicates obesity, linked to increased intake of refined carbohydrates and decreased exercise, in the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and related heart disease throughout the world. Lifestyle changes such as aerobic exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation are efficacious therapeutic approaches in the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Sustained glycemic control reduces the prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy and reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD). For example, normalization of glycemia with insulin therapy reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, collagen content, and diastolic dysfunction and limited progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetic rodent models.19 There is emerging evidence that some glycemic therapies may have specific benefits. In a retrospective cohort study of 10 920

patients, metformin use was associated with a low risk of mortality in diabetic individuals with heart failure.20 Sodium– glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists have beneficial effects on CVD outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients.13 A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists increased the risk of heart failure in patients with or at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients–Removing Excess Glucose) showed that SGLT2 antagonist treatment with empagliflozin reduced primary outcomes, such as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and CVD-related mortality, in 7020 diabetic patients.21 Finally, treatment with 2 long acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists significantly reduced CVD events and heart failure in high-risk diabetic patients.22,23 The results suggest that these antidiabetic drugs may have a role in preventing and treating diabetic cardiomyopathy and associated CVD in type 2 diabetic patients.
Functional Phenotype of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy
The first stage of diabetic cardiomyopathy is clinically asymptomatic and is characterized by increased fibrosis and stiffness; there is a reduction of early diastolic filling and an increase in atrial filling and enlargement, as well as an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure.24 Underlying pathological factors include hyperglycemia, systemic and cardiac insulin resistance, increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, systemic and tissue inflammation, oxidative stress, and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS; Figure 1).13 Reduced calcium

(Ca2+) pump activity-induced inefficient sequestration of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ is regarded as an important contributor to the development of the cardiac diastolic dysfunction.25
The second stage of diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by LV hypertrophy, cardiac remodeling, advancing cardiac diastolic dysfunction, and the consequent emergence of clinical indications of heart failure with normal ejection fraction.13 With progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy, diastolic dysfunction and reduced cardiac compliance may coexist with systolic dysfunction leading to reduced ejection fraction, prolonged pre-ejection performance, an enlarged LV chamber, shortened ejection period, and the latter by an increased resistance to filling with increased filling pressures.13 Abnormalities in contractile and regulatory protein expression are responsible for the mechanical defects in cardiac contraction. For example, decreased Ca2+ sensitivity along with shifts in cardiac myosin heavy chain from V1 to V3 isoforms contributes to the impaired cardiac systolic dysfunction, a longterm complication of diabetes mellitus.26 Phosphorylation of troponin also contributes to depressed myocardial contractility because myosin light chain-2 and troponin I are involved in regulating cardiomyocyte contraction.27
The phenotypes and underlying mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been mostly investigated in db/db mice, ob/ob mice, Zucker diabetic fatty rats, and diabetic patients.13 The impact of type 1 diabetes mellitus on systolic and diastolic functions is less clear. As in type 2 diabetes mellitus, diastolic dysfunction is also often observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus.28 The underlying mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus probably mostly overlap, but different alterations exist in hearts of type 2 diabetes mellitus.29 For instance, systolic function was preserved, and cardiac hypertrophy was not observed in type 1 Akita diabetic mice although hearts were smaller compared with nondiabetic controls.30 Cardiomyocyte autophagy was enhanced in type 1 but suppressed in type 2 diabetes mellitus.28 Clearly, further studies are necessary to understand the potential differences in phenotype and underlying mechanisms for diabetic cardiomyopathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Thus, cardiac dysfunction in diabetic hearts progresses from subclinical cardiac abnormalities, such as LV fibrosis, to diastolic dysfunction and eventually systolic dysfunction accompanied by reduced ejection fraction. Several noninvasive techniques, including echocardiography, computed tomography, and cinematic magnetic resonance imaging, have been applied to detect changes of cardiac structure (ie, fibrosis) and function.13 Furthermore, elevated levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), among others, may also serve as markers for diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure.13
Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Diabetic Cardiomyopathy
Cardiac Structural Abnormalities The mechanism promoting cardiomyocyte stiffness in the diabetic heart include impaired insulin metabolic signaling that

decreases glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) recruitment to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake, thus lowering sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump activity and increasing cardiomyocyte intracellular Ca2+.13 Meanwhile, abnormal insulin metabolic signaling also decreases insulin-stimulated coronary endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) activity and NO production increasing cardiomyocyte intracellular Ca2+/ Ca2+ sensitization and reducing sarcoplasmic Ca2+uptake.13 Reduction of NO bioavailability may also lead to phosphorylation of titin increasing the ratio of stiff titin isoform N2B/ N2BA (compliant) expression. These pathophysiological abnormalities increase cardiac stiffness and impair relaxation, cardinal manifestations of diabetic cardiomyopathy.13 Other pertinent abnormalities include hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress that promote expression of several cardiomyocyte hypertrophic genes, such as β-myosin heavy chain, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and B-type natriuretic peptide.31 High insulin levels induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by binding to the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. Insulin-like growth factor 1, produced by cardiomyocytes, can also stimulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via the insulin receptor, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways.32 Crosstalk between the insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin signaling pathways plays an important role in hyperglycemia/insulin resistance–induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy, as described in more detail later in this review.
Development of myocardial fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the deposition of stiff collagen and its crosslinking, cardiac interstitial fibrosis, progressive abolition of muscular fibrils, perivascular fibrosis, thickened and sclerotic small coronary vessels, and basement membrane thickening, as well as coronary microvascular sclerosis and microaneurysms.33,34 Activation of the RAAS and SNS, stimulation of advanced glycation end products (AGE)–mediated signaling via cell surface receptor for AGE (RAGE), hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia collectively lead to activation of transforming growth factor β1 pathway and dysregulation of extracellular matrix degradation.35 Some biomarkers of collagen synthesis, including inflammation cytokines, connective tissue growth factor, metalloproteinases, and galectin-3, can be used clinically in the determination of myocardial fibrosis.36 As discussed in more detail later, reduced bioavailable NO, increased oxidative stress, and an activated transforming growth factor β1/SMAD signaling pathway, in concert with impaired insulin metabolic signaling pathways, increase the myocardial fibronectin and collagen content and cardiac interstitial fibrosis characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy.17
Cardiac Insulin Resistance and Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Cardiac insulin signaling mediates cellular homeostasis via control of protein synthesis, substrate use, and cell survival. Glucose transport in cardiac tissue is mediated via GLUT4 as in skeletal muscle, liver, and fat tissue. Insulin, binding to the insulin receptor, activates insulin signaling/docking molecule insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 and downstream PI3K/ protein kinase B (Akt), stimulating GLUT4 translocation to the

cell membrane and subsequent glucose uptake.13 Furthermore, normal coronary artery and myocardial insulin metabolic signaling promotes eNOS activation and bioavailable NO necessary for optimal coronary microvascular flow and myocardial function.13,17 Cardiac insulin receptor knockout decreases cardiac glucose uptake, increases cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction.37,38 Double IRS-1/2 knockout reduces cardiomyocyte ATP content, impairs cardiac metabolism and function, and increases fibrosis and cardiac failure.37,38 Reduced PI3K/Akt signaling and reduced GLUT4 expression and translocation have also been found in ventricular muscle biopsies obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.39 The E3 ubiquitin ligase, mitsugumin 53, may play an important negative role in the maintenance of insulin signaling.40 Elevated cardiac mitsugumin 53 protein levels in a type 2 diabetic mouse model were correlated with increased proteosomal degradation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of mitsugumin 53 inhibited insulin signaling and increased cardiac fibrosis,41 suggesting that downregulation of cardiac mitsugumin 53 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy and progression to clinically manifested heart failure.
Risk factors, such as obesity and inappropriate activation of RAAS, can impair cardiac insulin metabolic signaling through enhanced activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase 1 signaling pathway,13,17 which increases serine phosphorylation and reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 and impairs PI3K engagement and Akt/eNOS activation and NO production.13,17 Lower NO production impairs coronary vessel relaxation and insulinmediated capillary recruitment, both of which are important for the delivery of insulin and glucose necessary for normal myocardial energetics.42–45 Impairment of NO production also leads to increased activation of collagen cross-linking enzymes, such as transglutaminase, thereby promoting cardiac fibrosis and stiffness.1,10 Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α , have been reported to induce cardiac insulin resistance through activation of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and cJun N terminal kinase (JNK) that induce phosphorylation of IRS-1.13 Activation of forkhead box–containing protein 1, O subfamily, directly regulates IRS-1 signaling and decreases PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet.46 Furthermore, deletion of cardiac forkhead box– containing protein 1, O subfamily, largely prevented heart failure in these animals.47 Thus, forkhead box–containing protein 1, O subfamily, may also provide a novel therapeutic or preventive strategy for treating individuals with diabetic cardiomyopathy.47
Role of Fructose in the Pathogenesis of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy High-fructose diets induce cardiomyocyte autophagy, oxidative stress, and impaired insulin metabolic PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling and interstitial fibrosis.16,48 Generally, fructose is readily absorbed and rapidly metabolized by the human liver through GLUT2 and 5.13 Fructose 1-phosphate is cleaved to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase B, which can then

be isomerized into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and acetylcoenzyme A (CoA). Acetyl-CoA is either oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle or directed toward FFA synthesis.49,50 Phosphorylation of fructose also decreases ATP production.49,50 Enhanced cellular fructose metabolism promotes several subcellular hexose sugar-related protein modifications, such as O-GlcNAc, and formation of AGE that contributes to impaired insulin metabolic signaling, reductions in NO production, and increased cardiac fibrosis.51
Decreased Flexibility in Substrate Using in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Under normal physiological circumstances, the heart displays considerable metabolic substrate flexibility, using energy from various substrates, such as FFAs, glucose, ketone bodies, lactate, and some amino acids to produce ATP, the predominant source of energy for cardiac energetics.13 Mitochondria normally occupy ≈20% to 30% of the total cell volume of cardiomyocytes.13 Typically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation produces >95% of ATP.52 The citric acid cycle usually accounts for the remaining 5% of ATP produced from glucose and lactate in the heart.53 However, in the setting of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hypertriglyceridemia, there is a reduction in the myocardium’s ability to use glucose as an energy source, and it subsequently switches to FFAs.53 This energy substrate switch is accompanied by impaired oxidative phosphorylation and a mitochondrial proton leak that results in increased production of ROS. As the heart has limited antioxidant capacity, increased mitochondrial ROS production leads to NO destruction and reduced bioavailable NO, hallmarks of diabetic cardiomyopathy.1,22
Role of Abnormal FFA Metabolism in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Increased FFA release from adipose tissue and increased capacity of myocyte sarcolemmal FFA transporters also contribute to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.13,53 Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a predominantly membranelocated protein and transporter that promotes FFA uptake in both sarcolemma and endosomal membranes, is increased in diabetic hearts.54 Increased subcellular vesicular recycling of CD36 from endosomes to the plasma membrane increases the rate of cellular FFA uptake in diabetic hearts.13,54 CD36 is also paramount in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)– mediated stimulation of FFA uptake in cardiomyocytes. Indeed, CD36 knockout mice show a 70% reduction in FFA uptake in cardiomyocytes,55 and CD36 deficiency rescues lipotoxic cardiomyopathy.56,57 Activation of AMPK is responsible for early activation of glucose uptake and glycolysis and improves cardiac function in diabetic patients.58 However, AMPK activation is attenuated in diabetes mellitus increasing FFA uptake and triacylglycerol accumulation and reducing glucose use, also characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy.59
Several lipid metabolites, such as diacylglycerols and ceramides, impair insulin metabolic signaling contributing to and exacerbating diabetic cardiomyopathy. Insulin sensitivity in obese humans can be correlated to elevated diacylglycerol content and PKC ε (protein kinase Cε) activation.60 Diacylglycerol increases lipid-associated endoplasmic reticulum stress.60 A

high-fat diet increases diacylglycerol in the membrane fraction, activating PKCε and inducing insulin resistance,61 and lowering NO production.62 Comparative gene identification 58 is a lipid droplet-associated protein that promotes triglyceride hydrolysis and adipose triglyceride lipase activation.63 Inhibition of comparative gene identification 58 induced hepatic steatosis and increased total diacylglycerol content in the absence of hepatic insulin resistance.63 Studies have found that comparative gene identification 58 gene knockout prevents diacylglycerol accumulation at the plasma membrane, PKCε activation, and the impairment of hepatic insulin metabolic signaling.61,63 Meanwhile, ceramide can directly activate atypical PKCs and inhibit insulin metabolic Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) signaling, attenuating GLUT4 translocation and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in diabetic hearts.62 These data support a role for intracellular compartmentation of diacylglycerol and ceramide in causing lipotoxicity and metabolic insulin resistance in several tissues, including the heart.
Abnormalities in Ketogenesis in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Type 2 diabetes mellitus is often associated with decreased ketogenesis because of systemic insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.64 Ketones, such as B-hydroxybutyrate, may play a key role in maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis in diabetic cardiomyopathy, where there is reduced cardiac glucose use.65 In this regard, treatment with empagliflozin, an SGLT2 antagonist, increased ketone levels providing a more efficient energy source in the failing myocardium of diabetic patients with heart failure,66 perhaps compensating for an impairment in mitochondrial energy transduction related to decreased myocardial glucose use.
Abnormalities in Cardiac Glucose FFA Cycling The glucose fatty acid cycle (Randle cycle) is a metabolic mechanism that involves competition between glucose and FFAs for their oxidation and uptake and is thus related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this regard, activation of lipolysis provides FFAs as the preferred fuel source leading to ketogenesis during fasting whereas inhibition of glucose oxidation contributes to a glucose-sparing effect that is an essential survival mechanism during times of starvation.67 In the fed state or during exercise, glucose is rerouted to glycogen, and muscle glycogen content is increased.67 Typically, FFA oxidation increases the mitochondrial ratios of acetyl-CoA/CoA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/ NAD+ that inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and impair glucose metabolism, resulting in accumulation of cytosolic citrate, increased glucose 6-phosphate, and inhibition of hexokinase.67,68 Meanwhile, glucose oxidation produces citrate that can be metabolized to malonyl-CoA; malonyl-CoA controls the entry and oxidation of long chain FFA favoring FFA esterification.67,69,70
Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Genesis of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and associated heart failure.71 Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation provides 90% of intracellular ATP production in cardiomyocytes, but

in type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitochondria switch from glucose to FFA oxidation for ATP production (Figure 1).13 This is accompanied by increased mitochondrial ROS generation and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Altered mitochondrial Ca2+ handling further promotes mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction leading to cell death.72 Metabolic stress–induced mitochondrial dysfunction also increases Ca2+ overload–induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores resulting in cardiomyocyte autophagy and cardiac necrosis.73
Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress in the Pathogenesis of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Oxidative stress promotes development and progression of cardiac insulin resistance, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and heart failure (Figure 1). Mitochondrial ROS are a natural byproduct of oxygen metabolism at complexes I and III within the electron transport chain.13 Under normal physiological conditions, the major electrochemical proton gradient is used to synthetize ATP.13 However, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance increase the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide flux to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, inhibition of electron transport in complex III, and excess ROS production.74 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase is another important source of cardiomyocyte ROS. Increased cardiomyocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity has been reported in diet-induced obesity and systemic and cardiac insulin resistance.75 Increased RAAS-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity may also directly promote cardiac fibrosis by activation of a profibrotic transforming growth factor β1/Smad 2/3 signaling pathway.76,77 Other sources of ROS in diabetic cardiomyopathy include increases in xanthine oxidase, and microsomal P-450 enzyme activity, and uncoupling of NO synthase. Elevated cardiac tissue ROS not only increases polyol pathway flux, formation of AGEs, expression of the receptor for AGEs and its activating ligands, PKC signaling, and the hexosamine pathway but also inhibits eNOS and prostacyclin synthase activity, all of which contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy as previously reviewed.78
Role of AGEs and RAGE in the Pathophysiology of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Hyperglycemia increases AGE accumulation and induces myocardial structural alterations by increases in nonenzymatic glycation, oxidation of lipids and proteins, myocardial collagen and fibronectin production, and connective tissue cross-linking and fibrosis (Figure 1).13 Indeed, AGE-induced connective tissue cross-linking of extracellular matrix promotes myocardial fibrosis and impaired passive relaxation.13 AGEs may also bind to RAGE, which further promotes maladaptive structural changes and impaired myocardial energetics.13 For example, interaction of AGEs with RAGE on cardiomyocyte surfaces induces maladaptive proinflammatory responses and increases matrix protein and connective tissue production, mediated through Janus kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation.13 In addition, AGEs elevation increases ROS production and

transforming growth factor β1/SMAD pathway activation and connective tissue production and fibrosis. In a prospective clinical study of 194 patients with acute coronary syndrome, AGEs were an independent risk factor in postinfarction heart failure.79 Furthermore, increases in plasma AGEs independently predicted mortality and hospitalization for heart failure in a study of 580 diabetic patients.80
Impaired Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Cytosolic Ca2+ levels regulate cellular metabolism, muscle contraction, and cell signaling (Figure 1). Typically, in cardiac excitation–contraction coupling, Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm through voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels after depolarization of the sarcolemma, and this triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+ binds troponin C to induce myofibrillar contraction.81,82 During cardiac relaxation, Ca2+ is transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the remaining cardiomyocyte Ca2+ is pumped out by the sarcolemma Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump.81,82 However, in diabetic cardiomyopathy, impaired Ca2+ handing by all of these transporters increases action potential duration and prolongs diastolic relaxation time.13 Elevated intracellular resting Ca2+, prolongation of intracellular Ca2+ decay, slowed Ca2+ transients, reduction of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumping, and impairment of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ reuptake have been documented in hearts of type 2 diabetic mice.83,84 Similar changes are seen in type 1 diabetic rodent models.85,86 The data suggest that impaired cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling plays a key role in the development of the cardiac diastolic dysfunction characteristic of early diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Inflammation as an Instigator of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy A maladaptive proinflammatory response has been implicated in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The innate immune system, that is, neutrophils, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and eosinophils, is involved (Figure 1).13 Activation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins 6 and 8, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, all contribute to cardiac oxidative stress, remodeling and fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction.13 Cytokine expression is regulated by the nuclear transcription factor, NF-κB.13 Finally, the Toll-like receptor-4 also plays an important role in triggering increased NF-κB, proinflammatory and innate immune system responses.87 These proinflammatory responses occur in different populations of cardiac cells, including coronary endothelial and smooth muscle cells, as well as fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes.
High FFA levels, impaired insulin metabolic signaling, and hyperglycemia activate the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome, a novel molecular marker in diabetic cardiomyopathy.88 Separation from cytoplasmic chaperones and oligomerization follows NLRP3 activation, leading to recruitment of procaspase-1.88 Activated caspase-1 processes interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 precursors and serves as an enhancer of multiple proinflammatory

pathways involving NF-κB, chemokines, and ROS. An NFκB–positive feedback loop further increases NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and procaspase-1 activation and pro-interleukin-1β processing and maturation.88 Meanwhile, increased monocyte/macrophage migration through the coronary endothelium increases resident cardiac macrophages, which can be polarized into proinflammatory M1 phenotypes under conditions of increased ROS and reduced bioavailable NO.13,17 In recent investigative work, it has been observed that macrophage proinflammatory M1 polarization is upregulated whereas macrophage M2 anti-inflammatory response is repressed in diabetic heart tissues.13,17
Activated RAAS in the Genesis of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Increased activation of the systemic and tissue RAAS in states of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (Figure 1). Serum angiotensin II levels are significantly correlated with postprandial glucose concentrations in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.89 Furthermore, the proinflammatory angiotensin II receptor 1 is upregulated and the anti-inflammatory AT-2R is downregulated in early diabetes mellitus.90 Exercise induces a shift of the RAAS toward the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/Mas receptor axis in skeletal muscle, providing protection in obese rats.91 Conversely, inhibition of the AT2 receptor with PD123319 impairs insulin signaling in C57BL/6 mice.92 In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia-induced activation of systemic RAAS seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy.93,94 Experimental evidence also supports a role for increased mineralocorticoids in systemic and tissue insulin resistance.17 High plasma aldosterone and overexpression of the tissue mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are associated with systemic insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia.95 Large randomized controlled trials have shown that inhibition of the aldosterone/MR signaling pathway reduces morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with both mild and moderately severe heart failure.62 RAAS activation impairs insulin metabolic signaling and induces systemic and cardiac insulin resistance, in part, through activation of the mTOR/S6 kinase 1 signaling pathway.96 Meanwhile, enhanced angiotensin II receptor 1 and MR activation increases coronary artery endothelial leukocyte/monocyte adhesion, proinflammatory cytokine expression, macrophage infiltration, and polarization resulting in an increase in the proinflammatory M1 phenotype in the myocardium. These abnormalities exacerbate the maladaptive cardiac remodeling, interstitial fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction seen in diabetic cardiomyopathy.17
Autonomic Neuropathy in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Cardiac autonomic neuropathy is a secondary complication related to sustained hyperglycemia (Figure 1) and includes abnormalities in heart rate control, vascular hemodynamics, and cardiac structure and function.13,97,98 An early characteristic of cardiac autonomic neuropathy is reduction of parasympathetic activity with an imbalance toward relatively higher SNS activity.99,100,101 In this regard, activation of the SNS enhances

β-1 adrenergic receptor (β1) signaling that promotes cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and impaired function.98
Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Increased Cell Death in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Cardiac oxidative stress, lipotoxicity, inflammation, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins impair the function of cardiac endoplasmic reticulum and promote endoplasmic reticulum stress, inducing the unfolded protein response (Figure 1).13 Together, endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response inhibit cellular protein synthesis and degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins and ultimately increase cell apoptosis and autophagy.13 Increased cardiac apoptosis is a major risk factor for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy; biopsied diabetic heart tissue expresses 85-fold more cardiomyocyte apoptosis than control nondiabetic hearts.101 Endoplasmic reticulum stress also induces autophagy through a Ca2+-dependent pathway, involving the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase pathways.102 Typically, autophagy is regulated through the mTOR, AMPK, and silent information regulator pathways.13 mTORC1 has been proposed to regulate autophagy by repressing the autophagy-related 1 (Atg1)–Atg13–Atg101/FIP200 (FAK family–interacting protein of 200 kDa) complex. Thus, inhibition of mTORC1 facilitates the initiation of autophagy.102 The inositol-requiring enzyme 1 arm of endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to JNK activation and increased phosphorylation of Bcl-2, which promotes its dissociation from Beclin-1.102 Thus, enhanced mTOR may serve as a convergence point for abnormalities involving the interplay between endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy in the hearts of diabetic individuals. However, in diabetic cardiomyopathy, dysregulation of autophagy impairs cardiomyocyte autophagosome and lysosome fusion.103 One study found that chronic metformin treatment activated AMPK activity, restored autophagic activity, and inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis by disrupting the Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 complex in diabetic heart tissue.103 Therefore, the activation of the autophagic response is usually regarded as a compensatory feedback mechanism to protect against cell apoptosis and to maintain normal cellular function in conditions, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Microvascular Dysfunction in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Diabetic cardiomyopathy is classically defined in the context of absence of overt coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, diabetic cardiomyopathy may be associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction that impairs coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion, ventricular function, and clinical outcomes, including CVD.104 In a clinical study of 2783 consecutive patients, impaired coronary flow reserve was associated with an adjusted 3.2- and 4.9-fold increase in the rate of cardiac death for both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals, respectively, indicating that coronary microcirculation dysfunction is a powerful, independent correlate of cardiac mortality among both diabetics and nondiabetics.105 Treatment with an

MR antagonist improved coronary microvascular function and prevented CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggesting an important role of cardiac MR activation in coronary microvascular dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.106 Structural abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation include luminal obstruction, inflammation infiltration, vascular remodeling, and perivascular fibrosis.107 Functional abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation include endothelial and smooth muscle cell dysfunction and impairment of vascular relaxation and constriction and ischemic reperfusion.107 The normal function of coronary arteries, and downstream microcirculatory vessels, is impaired in diabetic cardiomyopathy (Figure 1). Physiologically, several vasoactive substances, including NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors, released from endothelial cells lining the coronary microcirculation, play a beneficial vasodilatory role.42 Indeed, although NO-mediated vasodilation may be impaired, vascular function in the early stages of diabetes mellitus is often preserved through normal or even enhanced endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–induced vasodilation.42 However, both NO- and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–induced vasodilation are eventually affected, leading to significant dysfunction of the microcirculation in the later stages of diabetes mellitus.42 Recent investigation has also suggested that persistently high plasma endothelin-1 levels, along with reduced eNOS activity and NO production, are associated with the development of cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction in diabetic patients.108 In this regard, endothelial cell–specific endothelin-1 knockout prevented diabetes mellitus–induced cardiac fibrosis and exerted a beneficial effect in the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy.108
Molecular Protein Signature in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy
Several molecular proteins and signaling pathways have been implicated as important contributors to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. These include AMPK, PPARs, O-GlcNAc, SGLT2, PKC, MAPK, NFκB, nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate-responsive element modulator (CREM), microRNAs (miRNA), and exosomes as discussed below (Figure 2).
Impaired AMPK Activation in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy AMPK is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis.13 With cellular stress and an increased AMP/ATP ratio, AMPK activation enhances expression and translocation of GLUT4 and thus insulin-induced glucose uptake and increases mitochondrial biogenesis leading to FFA oxidation and glycolysis.58 Specifically, in cardiomyocytes, activated AMPK positively stimulates glucose uptake, FFA oxidation, and glycolysis while negatively regulating mTOR signaling, gluconeogenesis, and lipid and protein synthesis.109 Therefore, AMPK activation plays a beneficial role in preventing the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. For this reason, AMPK has been considered as a promising target for drug discovery and development for the prevention and reversal of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Alterations in Activation of Cardiac PPARs Several different PPAR isoforms, namely α, β/δ, and γ, are expressed in the heart and play a key role in myocardial glucose and lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Importantly, they also exert roles not directly related to metabolism, such as inflammation and oxidative stress.13 PPAR-α is expressed at relatively high levels in the heart, and its activation directly impacts FFA uptake and mitochondrial FFA oxidation.13 PPARα regulates lipoprotein assembly and transport and modulates both oxidant and antioxidant defenses.110 Overexpression of cardiomyocyte-specific PPARα causes decreased uptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, LV hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, and increased atrial natriuretic and B-type natriuretic peptide expression.59 Conversely, deletion of cardiac PPAR-α prevents fasting-induced expression of FFA metabolic genes and induces a switch from FFA to glucose use.111 With the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, chronic exposure to elevated FFAs seems to reduce PPAR-α expression. In rodent cardiomyocytes, this was shown to further decrease cardiac function by inhibition of FFA oxidation and increased intracellular fat accumulation.112,113 However, human studies suggest that PPAR-α expression is not significantly altered in the hearts of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.72,114 Activated PPAR-α–induced increases in FFA oxidation and use in the diabetic heart may thus initially serve as a compensatory mechanism to adjust substrate oxidation to available substrate supply. Furthermore, reduced PPAR-α in advanced disease may have maladaptive consequences in terms of cardiac metabolism, including glucotoxicity and functional cardiac abnormalities. The role of PPAR-α in the development of cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy has been inadequately evaluated and needs to be further investigated. Similar to PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ isoforms are also expressed abundantly in heart tissue and regulate transcriptional gene expression and FFA metabolism.115 Enhanced PPAR-β/δ signaling promotes FFA use whereas deletion of PPAR-β/δ decreases FFA oxidative gene expression and FFA oxidation.115 In addition, PPAR-γ plays important roles in cardiac antihypertrophic and anti-inflammatory effects.13 PPAR-γ agonists enhance cardiomyocyte insulin sensitivity and improve cardiomyocyte glucose uptake.13 Thus, PPAR-γ may be beneficial in maintaining glucose and FFA metabolism and cardiac function. Conversely, a deficiency in PPAR-γ signaling may contribute to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Increased O-GlcNAc in Promoting Cardiac Fibrosis in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Hyperglycemia is associated with increased O-GlcNAcylation, which causes post-translational modification of cardiac proteins (Figure 2). Sustained O-GlcNAc signaling exists in the diabetic heart and can exert detrimental effects that include decreases in mitochondrial function and energy generation and increases in cardiac dysfunction and heart failure.116 Under physiological conditions, the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway drives a component of fructose-6-phosphate metabolism from glycolysis to generate the O-GlcNAc moiety.117 Transient activation of O-GlcNAc signaling is normally cytoprotective and increases cell survival.118 In contrast to transient upregulation, sustained elevation of O-GlcNAc signaling in

the diabetic heart mediates diabetes mellitus–induced impairment of insulin metabolic signaling, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, myocardial excitation–contraction coupling, and cardiac relaxation.119 Overexpression of O-GlcNAcase removes O-GlcNAc and restores normal cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling and cardiac function,120 suggesting that targeting of hexosamine biosynthesis and O-GlcNAc may be a fruitful potential strategy for the prevention and therapy of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
SGLT2 Abnormalities and Potential Cardiac Benefits of Inhibition of This Transporter Glucose is actively transported from the gut lumen into the gastrointestinal epithelium primarily by SGLT1, highly expressed in the brush border membrane of enterocytes.121,122 In hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, glucose and fructose absorption through the intestinal mucosa increases because of higher expression of SGLT1, GLUT2, and GLUT5 and increased brush border disaccharidases, sucrase, maltase, and lactase activity.121,122 SGLT2 is exclusively expressed in the kidney and mostly localized in the brush border membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells in the S1 segment of the proximal convoluted tubule.121,122 SGLT2 expression is significantly increased in diabetic humans,123 rats,124 and db/db mice,125 and this is correlated with glomerular hyperfiltration, increased glucose reabsorption, and elevated plasma glucose.126 Conversely, SGLT2 inhibition leads to natriuresis, osmotic diuresis, plasma volume contraction, and reduction of blood pressure and arterial stiffness, all mechanisms that may mitigate diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Furthermore, SGL2 inhibitor treatment can shift cell metabolism from glucose to FA oxidation. Thus, the cardiac beneficial effects of SGLT2 may include making more of the ketone body, B-hydroxybutyrate, a highly energy-efficient substrate for cardiac metabolism. Targeting SGLT2 has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients (Figure 2).21 Ongoing research is addressing the role of these agents for specific prevention and treatment of heart failure in diabetic individuals.127
PKC Activation Promotes Development of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy PKC signaling pathways are activated in diabetic cardiomyopathy in response to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (Figure 2). Oxidative stress, inflammation, and enhanced RAAS and SNS activity further promote PKC activation. To date, ≈15 isoforms of PKC have been described in humans. These isoforms can be divided into 3 subfamilies based on second messenger signaling and particular mode of activation.128,129 PKCα, β, ε, θ, and δ isoforms have been proposed to be involved in the development of diabetic cardiac hypertrophy.128,129 For example, PKC β2 has been shown to mediate hyperglycemia-induced diastolic cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats through alterations in caveolin-3 expression and insulin metabolic Akt/eNOS signaling.128 Further supporting its relevance, targeted inhibition of PKC β2 in a transgenic mouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy has been reported to improve fractional shortening and reverse cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.130 Collectively, the data suggest that activation of PKC can induce cellular and functional changes

that contribute to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure.
Role of MAPK and JNK Activation in the Genesis of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy MAPK activation has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNKs are 3 important MAPK subfamilies that regulate cardiac growth, hypertrophy, and remodeling.13 Enhanced myocardial phosphorylation of Erk 1/2 and activation of p38 MAPK occurs during ischemia in streptozotocininduced diabetic models.131 Our research and that of others has demonstrated that obesity/insulin resistance–induced cardiac dysfunction is associated with enhanced S6 kinase 1 and Erk1/2 signaling.17,132 JNK can be activated by oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and sphingolipid metabolites.133 In turn, enhanced JNK signaling in the diabetic heart contributes to oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and interstitial fibrosis.133 In contrast, inhibition of JNK phosphorylation by a curcumin analog prevents high glucose-induced inflammation and apoptosis in diabetic hearts.133 In addition to these observations, JNK may play an important role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis.134 As such, JNK activation was shown to cause increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis as early as days 3 and 7 in a type 1 diabetic rodent model.134 Collectively, activation of both MAPK and JNK signaling seems to contribute significantly to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Role of NF-κB Activation in the Genesis of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy NF-κB is one of the key transcription factors that regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, profibrotic genes, and cell survival,135 thus contributing to mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction in diabetic hearts. NF-κB is found in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells. On stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated and its p50/p65 subunits translocate to the nucleus and bind κB nuclear elements.135 In diabetes mellitus, ROS, AGEs, and an activated cardiac tissue RAAS can directly induce NF-κB activation. This, in turn, promotes maladaptive immune responses and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8.13 Activated NF-κB in diabetic mouse hearts has been shown to be associated with increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase–mediated generation of ROS, peroxynitrite, and superoxide.136 These processes lead to a reduction in bioavailable NO. Inhibition of NF-κB with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate improves mitochondrial structural integrity and inhibits oxidative stress, increasing ATP synthesis and NO bioavailability, thereby restoring cardiac function in type 2 diabetes mellitus.136
Abnormalities of Nrf2-Related Antioxidant Actions in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Nrf2 is a leucine zipper protein that promotes the expression of antioxidant proteins, such as hemoxygenase in response to oxidative stress (Figure 2). Nrf2 is predominantly regulated by its binding to the inhibitor, Keap1, which targets Nrf2 for ubiquitination and degradation, thus maintaining low cellular levels of Nrf2.137 Under oxidative stress, Nrf2 and its

regulators undergo a variety of modifications that cause dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1. Free Nrf2 can then bind to small Maf proteins in the nucleus to activate transcription.137 Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance repress Nrf2 expression and activity through an Erk 1/2-mediated pathway that contributes to oxidative stress and insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes.138 Restoration of Nrf2 activity prevents diabetes mellitus–induced lipid accumulation, inflammation, fibrosis, and associated cardiac dysfunction,139 providing another potential strategy for the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Role of the Transcription Factor CREM in the Genesis of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy CREM is a transcription factor that regulates cAMP signaling and cardiac gene expression (Figure 2). Members of the CREM family may promote fibrosis of the heart, especially in response to hyperglycemia and elevated FFAs.140 For example, CREM expression is increased in cardiomyocytes of chronically hyperglycemic type 1 diabetic mice, and this is accompanied by increased cardiac fibrosis.141 These adverse effects were associated with alterations in histone acetylation and alterations in miRNAs profiles, suggesting that CREM activation may promote epigenetic and genetic modifications in cardiac proteins and mediate glycemic memory in ongoing progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Role of miRNAs in Promotion of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with increased expression of miRNAs—a group of short single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules with an average length of 22 nucleotides. Importantly, miRNAs control the expression of transcriptional and post-transcriptional target genes through binding to the 3′-untranslated region and regulate mitochondrial function, ROS production, Ca2+ handling, apoptosis, autophagy, and fibrosis, all of which are regarded as important mechanisms in diabetes mellitus–induced cardiac hypertrophy, remodeling, and fibrosis, as well as heart failure progression.142,143 miR15a, -21, -24, -29, -30d, -103, -126, -146a, -150, -191, -223, -320, -375, and -486 have all been reported to be increased in type 2 diabetic individuals.142,143 In cardiac tissue of a type 1 diabetic rodent model, expression of miR-21, -24, -142-3p, -195, -199a-3p, -700, -705, -208, -221, and 499-3p was upregulated whereas expression of miR-1, -20a, -29a, -143, -220b, and -373 was downregulated.144 miR103, 107, -143, and -181 play a role in insulin sensitivity and systemic glucose metabolism.145,146 Increased expression of miR-454, 500,-142-3p/5p, and 1246 has been identified in cardiac diastolic dysfunction.147 Other miRNAs, such as miR-113a, -133a, -150 have been found to be involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis.148
Abnormalities of Exosomes in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy There is a close relationship between nutrient metabolism and exosome release from cells, such as cardiomyocytes. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles with a diameter ranging from 30 to 90 nm and are regarded as important mediators of cell-to-cell communication.24 They contain a variety of biological components, including lipids, miRNAs, proteins,

634  Circulation Research  February 16, 2018

Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 16, 2020

and transcription factors that regulate both normal physiological and pathophysiological effects.24 Exosomes that function with glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes to increase glucose uptake, glycolysis, and pyruvate production in endothelial cells were released from cardiomyocytes after glucose deprivation.149 In type 2 diabetic hearts, exosomes containing high levels of miR-320 are released from cardiomyocytes and transported to coronary endothelial cells, resulting in reduced NO production and inhibition of angiogenesis via decreases heat shock protein 20.150 However, heat shock protein 20–engineered exosomes have a beneficial role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte exosome secretion and restoration of hyperglycemia-induced cardiac dysfunction.151 Therefore, exosomes may not only act as biomarkers, but targeting exosomes may also be a potential therapeutic strategy in the prevention or progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Conclusion and Future Perspectives
The cardinal features of diabetic cardiomyopathy include cardiac stiffness, myocardial fibrosis, and hypertrophy with cardiac diastolic dysfunction and subsequent progression to both systolic dysfunction and clinical heart failure. Importantly, hyperglycemia and systemic and cardiac insulin resistance are independently associated with the development and progression of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure in diabetes mellitus. From a mechanistic point of view, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, increased formation and deposition of AGEs, impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and function, inflammation, activation of RAAS and SNS, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and cardiac metabolic disorders are involved in the pathophysiological process. Underlying these pathophysiological events, evidence supports a role for several proteins and signaling pathways, including AMPK, PPARs, O-GlcNAc, SGLT2, PKC, MAPK, NFκB, Nrf2, miRNA, and exosomes. Although diabetic cardiomyopathy seems to have an extensive preclinical course and the pathophysiological changes seem to be induced by the metabolic alterations in diabetes mellitus, a formal definition for diabetic cardiomyopathy as a distinct clinical entity remains vague because of a lack of accepted diagnostic criteria and information on subclinical CVD in the early stages of diabetes mellitus. Currently, there is not a specific histological property, biochemical marker, or clinical manifestation for the definitive diagnosis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Also, there are no prospective clinical trials to support that hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia independently increase the risk for development of diabetic cardiomyopathy in the absence of other risk factors, such as obesity, coronary heart disease, and hypertension. Recent scientific evidence for the potential use of exosome and circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for detection of diabetic cardiomyopathy highlights emerging methods for the diagnosis and prevention of diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy, but the results of the recently published Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics trial indicate that screening of asymptomatic patients with nuclear imaging

does not improve cardiac event rates.152 Unfortunately, screening approaches including B-type natriuretic peptide, exercise stress testing, and echocardiographic assessment do not seem to be sufficiently sensitive to identify subclinical dysfunction in diabetic patients.153 Therefore, further studies are vital to the understanding of the precise mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy and to the development of novel strategies to reduce the risk of heart failure in diabetic patients.
