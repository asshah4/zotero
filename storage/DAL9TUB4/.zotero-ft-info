Subject:        <p>Heart is the most important part in the body of living<br />
organisms. It affects and is affected by any factor in the body.<br />
Therefore, it is a good detector for all conditions in the body. Heart<br />
signal is a non-stationary signal; thus, it is utmost important to study<br />
the variability of heart signal. The Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has<br />
attracted considerable attention in psychology, medicine and has<br />
become important dependent measure in psychophysiology and<br />
behavioral medicine. The standards of measurements, physiological<br />
interpretation and clinical use for HRV that are most often used were<br />
described in many researcher papers, however, remain complex<br />
issues are fraught with pitfalls. This paper presents one of the nonlinear<br />
techniques to analyze HRV. It discusses many points like, what<br />
Poincar&eacute; plot is and how Poincar&eacute; plot works; also, Poincar&eacute; plot&#39;s<br />
merits especially in HRV. Besides, it discusses the limitation of<br />
Poincar&eacute; cause of standard deviation SD1, SD2 and how to overcome<br />
this limitation by using complex correlation measure (CCM). The<br />
CCM is most sensitive to changes in temporal structure of the<br />
Poincar&eacute; plot as compared toSD1 and SD2.</p>
