Abstract 
Recently, it has been reported that transthyretin (TTR)-immunoreactive amyloid deposition with cerebral amyloid angiopathy in central nervous system is a common pathological finding in type I familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). In the present study, we performed isolation and sequence analysis of TTR-related amyloid fibril protein from the meninges of a patient with type I FAP. Purified major amyloid fibril protein had a molecular weight of 15 kDa. Complete sequence analysis revealed that this amyloid fibril protein was a variant TTR with a single amino acid substitution of methionine for valine at position 30. This variant TTR is a previously unrecognized as cerebrovascular amyloid fibril protein. Furthermore, the patients with type I FAP are well known to have the variant TTR in the serum. These suggest that cerebrovascular amyloid fibril protein in type I FAP may derive from a serum precursor.

Abstract 
Various types of amyloid fibril deposits occur in the nervous system with unique clinical characteristics and pathogeneses. Genetic mutations cause the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathies and acquired polyneuropathies occurring particularly in patients suffering from hypernephromas and myelomas also result from the production of abnormal proteins. Amyloid fibril deposits in cerebral plaques and vessels consisting of β-protein are seen in acquired and familial Alzheimer's disease and in Down's syndrome individuals over 40 years of age. This amyloid fibril deposition could result from a mutational, transcriptional or post-translational alteration in these pathologic processes with most evidence supporting the latter. Other diseases including hereditary cerebral hemorrhage of the Dutch type and Batten's disease involve β-amyloid deposition. The features of the familial and transmissible forms of the spongiform encephalopathies are associated with the prion protein which comprises the amyloid fibril deposits in these conditions. This wide variety of nervous system disorders having amyloid deposits as their primary or subsidiary characteristic make studies of these conditions intriguing models for research workers in clinical, pathologic and molecular biologic fields.

Abstract 
In 1906, Alois Alzheimer, a German physician, performed an autopsy on the brain of a 56-year-old woman with a history of progressive mental deterioration. In her cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible for reasoning and memory, were strange fiber bundles, which he termed neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and accumulations of cellular debris, the senile plaques (SPs), which together define Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The major risk factor for AD is aging. With rare exceptions, a vast majority of patients with AD are over the age of 60 and, within the United States, 10% of the population older than 65 years and upwards of 47% older than 85 years is afflicted. In 2000, there were 25 million persons afflicted with AD worldwide (4.5 million in the United States), a number expected to increase to 114 million by 2050 (13.2 million in the United States) lacking new preventive or neuroprotective therapies.

Abstract 
In dementia syndromes, the information processing capacity has deteriorated with deficits predominantly in cognitive, but also in emotional and intentional domains. These deficits compromise the social and cultural activities of a person to a critical degree. Dementia is a highly prevalent disorder in old age. Dementia diseases have to be distinguished from dementia syndromes. (a) A dementia disease process destroys certain brain structures, leading to clinically observable signs and symptoms. The most important primary dementia disease is Alzheimer's dementia. However, several other diseases may lead finally to a dementia syndrome, such as the accumulation of vascular brain lesions or strokes in cerebrovascular disease. The primary dementia diseases are progressive. Thus, the clinical syndrome follows a time course of progressive deterioration in different domains. (b) A dementia syndrome is a pattern of regularly observed signs in subjects with dementia diseases. There are several types of dementia syndromes. The dementia syndrome of Alzheimer's dementia is most common. A characteristic feature of the syndrome is the deterioration of cognitive functions—it first presents with a disorder of episodic memory. Then, the language functions, motor performance, and judgement become defective. Personality changes and disorders in the domain of affective and intentional functions are often observed.
