Tissue mass is an important determinant of the space available for wavelets to circulate. Hence, larger tissue masses can support more wavelets and therefore might be expected to favor the induction and sustainability of AF.7SAtrial size has long been known to be important, in fact critical, in the ability to generate atrial fibrillation, and it has been shown to correlate with increased vulnerability to AF in humans79(Table I).
AUTONOMIC FACTORS The autonomic nervous system has been exten-
sively studied in relation to the mechanism of atrial fibrillation and flutter. The heart and blood vessels are supplied by both afferent and efferent autonomic nerve fibers that, through both sympathetic and parasympathetic mechanisms, have profound effects on
the genesis, perpetuation, and rate of many arrhythmias. Likewise, ‘arrhythmias themselves influence the autonomic nervous system through effects on blood pressure and atrial and ventricular diastolic pressure. For example, the fall in blood pressure that sometimes accompanies rapid supraventricular
tachycardia activates the sympathetic nervous system through reduced afferent activity from the carotid sinus to the vasomotor center and causes the rate to increase further. This may help to explain the transformation of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia to AF as occurs in patients with the Wolff–Parkinson-White syndrome. It has been observed in such patients that an increase in the rate of the tachycardia precedes onset of AF and that this transformation may be blocked by propanolol.soThe rise in atrial and ventricular diastolic pressure during tachycardia can activate mechanoreceptors (C fibers), resulting in a reflex withdrawal of sympathetic tone, an increase in vagal tone, and subsequent slowing of tachycardia. While the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems generally have opposite effects and tend to inhibit each other, their anatomic distribution is not uniform and is incompletely understood. Furthermore; functional responses to cholinergic stimulation occur within milliseconds, whereas those to adrenergic stimulation take seconds for target activation.81
Autonomic factors involved in the mechanisms of paroxysmal AF have been examined in depth by Coumel.B2They have postulated 2 different patterns, one with a predominantly vagal etiology and another in which adrenergic mechanisms induce AF. Vagal mechanisms appear to predominantly precipitate paroxysmal AF in hearts in which no evidence of structural disease can be found with conventional tests. Episodes of paroxysmal AF occurring at night and postprandially, alternating with periods of atrial flutter and preceded by bradycardia, suggest a predominantly vagal mechanism.82Vagal stimulation, by shortening the refractory period, causes wavelength shortening, which favors reentry. This may be a heterogeneous effect, causing an increased dispersion of refractoriness. Increased dispersion of refractoriness, along with shorter refractory periods, has

been shown by the extrastimulus technique to be a feature in patients with idiopathic paroxy~mal AF in some studies.83AS kmg as vagal tone is high, the
arrhythmia will be sustained,Bdwhich may explain why AF in such patients commonly occurs during sleep, terminating in the morning. This form of paroxysmal AF is found more frequently in men and is seen in relatively young patients.82
Diseased hearts tend to lose physiologic vagal predominance, and adrenergically induced arrhythmias are more commonly seen.82The far less common adrenergically mediated form of paroxysmal AF would be suggested by daytime attacks occurring at times of stress in patients with heart disease. Adrenergic factors involved in the precipitation of AF may include automatic and triggered activity in the atria and a decrease in action potential duration favoring microreentry. They are of importance in AF associated with thyrotoxicosis and pheochromocytoma, and probably are also instrumental in postoperative atrial arrhythmias. Determining which autonomic mechanism predominates in any particular patient can help to guide therapy in paroxysmal AF. For example, ~ blockers are useful in adrenergically mediated paroxysmal AF, but are relatively contraindicated in patients with predominantly vagally mediated paroxysmal AF.
ALCOHOLAND ATRIALFIBRILLATION AF is associated with alcohol, both in the context
of brief periods of increased intake in patients without obvious heart disease (the ‘‘holiday heart syndrome” ) and as part of the clinical spectrum of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Alcohol has also been
