PREAMBLE
Aortic pathologies are numerous, presenting manifestations are varied, and aortic diseases present to many clinical services, including primary physicians, emergency department physicians, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, echocardiographers, radiologists, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) imagers, and intensivists. Many aortic diseases manifest emergently and are potentially catastrophic unless suspected and detected promptly and accurately. Optimal management of these conditions depends on the reported ﬁndings from a handful of imaging modalities, including echocardiography, CT, MRI, and to a lesser extent invasive aortography.
In the past decade, there have been remarkable advances in noninvasive imaging of aortic diseases. This document is intended to provide a comprehensive review of the applications of these noninvasive imaging modalities to aortic disease. Emphasis is on the advantages and disadvantages of each modality when applied to each of the various aortic diseases. Presently, there is a lack of consensus on the relative role

(comparative effectiveness) of these imaging modalities. An attempt has been made to determine ﬁrst-line and second-line choices for some of these speciﬁc conditions. Importantly, we have emphasized the need for uniform terminology and measurement techniques. Whenever possible, these recommendations are evidence based, following a critical review of the literature. In some instances, the recommendations reﬂect a consensus of the expert writing group and include ‘‘vetting’’ by additional experts from the supporting imaging societies.
Because of the importance of prompt recognition to their successful treatment, this review emphasizes acute aortic syndromes (AAS), such as aortic dissection and its variants (e.g., intramural hematoma [IMH]), rupture of ascending aortic aneurysm, aortic trauma, and penetrating ulcer. Other entities, such as Takayasu aortitis (TA), giant-cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA), and mycotic aneurysm, are discussed brieﬂy. Less common aortic diseases such as aortic tumors (because of their rarity) and congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries, aortic arch, and sinus of Valsalva aneurysms are not addressed. Several other topics are also beyond the scope of this review, including the important and emerging role of genetics in the evaluation and management of aortic diseases. Moreover, this document is not intended to replace or extend the recommendations of prior excellent guidelines in decision making and management for these conditions.1
To summarize, the focus of this document is the fundamental role of the major noninvasive imaging techniques. In addition to clinical acumen and suspicion, knowledge of these imaging modalities is crucial for the assessment and management of the often lifethreatening diseases of the aorta.
I. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE AORTA
A. The Normal Aorta and Reference Values
The aorta is the largest and strongest artery in the body; its wall consists of three layers: the thin inner layer or intima, a thick middle layer or media, and a rather thin outer layer, or adventitia. The endothelium-lined aortic intima is a thin, delicate layer and is easily traumatized. The media is composed of smooth muscle cells and multiple layers of elastic laminae that provide not only tensile strength but also distensibility and elasticity, properties vital to the aorta’s circulatory role. The adventitia contains mainly collagen as well as the vasa vasorum, which nourish the outer half of the aortic wall and a major part of the media.
The elastic properties of the aorta are important to its normal function. The elasticity of the wall allows the aorta to accept the pulsatile output of the left ventricle in systole and to modulate continued forward ﬂow during diastole. With aging the medial elastic ﬁbers undergo thinning and fragmentation. The ordinary concentric arrangement of the laminae is disturbed. These degenerative changes are accompanied by increases in collagen and ground substance. The loss of elasticity and compliance of the aortic wall contributes to the increase in pulse pressure commonly seen in the elderly and may be accompanied by progressive dilatation of the aorta.
A geometrically complex organ, the aorta begins at the bulb-shaped root (level 1 in Figure 1) and then courses through the chest and abdomen in a candy cane–shaped conﬁguration, with a variable orientation to the long axis of the body, until it terminates in the iliac bifurcation. The aorta consists of ﬁve main anatomic segments: the aortic root, the tubular portion of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, the descending thoracic aorta, and the abdominal aorta. The most proximal part of the ascending aorta, the aortic root (segment I in Figure 1), includes the aortic valve annulus, aortic valve cusps,

coronary ostia, and sinuses of Valsalva. Distally the root joins the tubular portion of the ascending aorta (segment II) at an easily recognized landmark termed the sinotubular junction (STJ). The tubular portion of the ascending aorta extends from the STJ to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery. This relatively long segment is subdivided into segment IIa, which extends from the STJ to the pulmonary artery level, and segment IIb, from the pulmonary artery level to the brachiocephalic artery. The aortic arch (segment III) extends from the brachiocephalic artery to the left subclavian artery. The descending thoracic aorta (segment IV) may be subdivided into the proximal part (segment IVa), which extends from the left subclavian artery to the level of the pulmonary artery, and the distal part (segment IVb), which extends from the level of the pulmonary artery to the diaphragm. The abdominal aorta (segment V) may be subdivided into the proximal part (segment Va), which extends from the diaphragm

to the ostia of the renal arteries, and the distal part (segment Vb), from the renal arteries to the iliac bifurcation.
1. Normal Aortic Dimensions. Because of the ease with which it can be visualized and its clinical relevance,2,3 the aortic root is the segment for which the greatest amount of data are available. Several large studies have reported normal aortic root diameters in the parasternal long-axis view by two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).4-10 Measurement of the aortic root diameter should be made perpendicular to the axis of the proximal aorta, recorded from several slightly differently oriented long-axis views. The standard measurement is taken as the largest diameter from the right coronary sinus of Valsalva to the posterior (usually noncoronary) sinus. Most studies report aortic root diameter measurements at end-diastole using the leading edge–to–leading edge technique (Figure 2).
In adults, aortic dimensions are strongly positively correlated with age5-8,10,11 and body size.4-6,8,10,11 They are larger in men than in women of the same age and body size.6,12,13 Although in several reports, aortic diameters have been normalized to body surface area (BSA),10,13,14 this approach has not been entirely satisfactory because it is systematically lower in smaller than in larger normal adults. Fortunately, among children, the regression line of aortic diameter and height (rather than BSA) has a near-zero intercept, so that normalization to height has proved to be a simple and accurate alternative in growing children.15 Benchmark values from which the guidelines have been taken1,16 come from the work of Roman et al.,9 who reported normal root dimensions for three age groups (Figure 3).
The upper limit of normal aortic diameter has been deﬁned as 2 SDs greater than the mean predicted diameter. The Z score (the number of SDs above or below the predicted mean normal diameter) is a useful way to quantify aortic dilatation. Among normal subjects, 95.4% have Z scores between À2 and 2. Therefore, an aortic diameter can be considered dilated when the Z score is $2. Using the Z score allows comparison of a given patient’s aortic size at different time points, accounting for the effects of advancing age and increasing

For example, an individual between the ages of 20 and 39 years (center panel, green) who has a BSA of 2.0 m2 (vertical green line) has a normal root diameter range (2 SDs) between 2.75 and 3.65 cm, as indicated by the intersections of the two horizontal green lines with the green-shaded parallelogram.

body size, thus distinguishing normal from pathologic growth. The Z score is therefore particularly useful for evaluating growing children.
It should be mentioned that aortic root dimensions may be increased by the hemodynamic effects of both endurance and strength exercise training in competitive athletes.17-19 This aortic root enlargement appears to be greater at the sinuses of Valsalva than at the aortic annulus or STJ. However, it should be emphasized that the effects of exercise training on aortic diameters are relatively small and that marked enlargement should suggest a pathologic process.17,18
Recently, making use of a database consisting of a multiethnic population of 1,207 apparently normal adolescents and adults $15 years of age, investigators devised equations to predict mean normal aortic root diameter and its upper limit by age, body size (BSA or height), and gender6 (Table 1 for men and Table 2 for women). These equations have been used graphically to depict the upper limits of the 95% conﬁdence interval for normal aortic root diameter using surfaces to depict the interacting effects of age and body size (see Figure 4 for men and Figure 5 for women).
A noncontrast gated cardiac computed tomographic study,20 including 4,039 adult patients, showed age, BSA, gender, and hypertension to be directly associated with thoracic aortic diameters perpendicular to the long axis of the aorta. These associations are concordant with those from echocardiographic studies. In another recent large study using similar methodology, the mean value of the

diameters of the ascending aorta was 1.8 6 0.2 cm/m2 and of the descending thoracic aorta was 1.4 6 0.2 cm/m2, with the upper limits of normal being 2.1 and 1.8 cm/m2, respectively.21 However, more ac-
curate normal values of thoracic aortic diameters may be obtained by
anatomically correct double-oblique short-axis images using electro-
cardiographically gated multidetector CT or by MRI of axially ori-
ented aortic segments. The upper limits of normal are 3.7 cm for
the aortic root at the sinuses, 3.6 cm for the ascending aorta and 2.5 cm for the descending thoracic aorta by CT,8 and 2.5 cm for
the descending thoracic aorta and 2.0 cm for the upper abdominal aorta by MRI.22 As with echocardiography, aortic root and ascending
aortic diameters increase signiﬁcantly with age and BSA on CT and
MRI. Aortic root diameters increase 0.9 mm per decade in men and 0.7 mm per decade in women.4
The establishment of normative values and reference ranges, tak-
ing into account aging and gender, is of great importance for diag-
nosis, prognosis, serial monitoring, and determining the optimal
timing for surgical intervention. Normal values and proximal aortic di-
ameters have been reported using different imaging techniques, from the pioneer studies based on M-mode and 2D echocardiography9,10 to more recent studies obtained using CT7,8,20,23-25 and MRI.5,26
Despite differences in image acquisition methods, temporal and
spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios, CT, MRI, TTE, and trans-
esophageal echocardiography (TEE) have evolved as near equal stan-
dards for assessing aortic root size. Each of these modalities has

advantages and disadvantages, which have been discussed. It should be emphasized that normal aortic diameters vary systematically by age, gender, and body size, and reference values indexed to those parameters have been provided. Last, it is critically important to emphasize not only methodologic variance but also inter- and intraobserver variability. In several studies, variability of measurement of proximal aortic diameters ranges from 1.6 to 5 mm.8,23,24,27,28 Given this degree of variability, apparent small changes in proximal aortic diameters on serial computed tomographic examinations may be within the range of measurement error. Accordingly, for all imaging techniques, we recommend that changes of #3 mm by electrocardiographically gated CT and #5 mm without electrocardiographic gating be viewed with caution and skepticism.
B. How to Measure the Aorta
Accurate and reproducible measurements of aortic dimensions are necessary for the detection and classiﬁcation of aortic disease and for guiding therapeutic decisions. Modern imaging modalities enable one to make measurements far more accurately than did invasive contrast angiography, the only tool originally available.
Echocardiography, CT, and MRI each has particular strengths and limitations but can be adapted for the acquisition of views that allow measurement of the diameter or cross-sectional area of different segments of the aorta (Figure 1).
1. Interface, Deﬁnitions, and Timing of Aortic Measurements. The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) proposed standards for measurement of the aortic root in 1978.29 The ASE recommended measurement at end-diastole from the leading edge of the anterior root wall to the leading edge of the posterior aortic root wall. This technique was believed to minimize the impact of ‘‘blooming’’ of bright reﬂectors on this measurement. The ASE-recommended method was followed in many important

clinical and epidemiologic studies10,13 that have reported normal limits for individuals of differing body size and age, and these normal limits have been incorporated into multiple guidelines for imaging in adults (Figures 4 and 5).1,9,16 As a consequence, much of the available data on normal aortic root size as well as on the prevalence and prognostic signiﬁcance of aortic dilatation in adults have emerged from echocardiography.6,10,13
Societal guidelines for measurement by CT or MRI are not currently available. Consequently, uniformity in measurement methods is lacking. Many research and clinical studies using these modalities have reported aortic measurements made from inner edge to inner edge on electrocardiographically gated or nongated images. The 2010 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of thoracic aortic disease took the opposite approach, recommending measurement of aortic diameter between external surfaces to avoid confounding by intraaortic thrombus or atheroma, as is commonly found in the abdominal but not in the ascending aorta.1 Furthermore, there is no standardized ‘‘trigger time’’ (end-systole vs end-diastole) for image acquisition. Thus, the use of multiple imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and 2D and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography has led to nonuniformity in measurement techniques. Moreover, there is currently no standardized approach for reconciling aortic measurements across imaging modalities (echocardiography, CT, MRI, aortography) by trigger time (end-systole vs end-diastole) or by edge selection (leading edge, inner-inner, outer-outer). This writing committee had hoped to recommend a uniform and consistent measurement technique to minimize differences among these various imaging modalities. However, after much consideration, the group recommends that echocardiographic measurements continue to be made in the standard fashion from leading edge to leading edge, at end-diastole, and perpendicular to the long axis of the aorta. The advantages of end-diastolic measurements include greater reproducibility (because aortic pressure is most stable in late diastole) and the ease of identiﬁcation of end-diastole by the onset of the QRS

Figure 7 Aortic root measurements by CT. The aortic root diameter is commonly measured between the inner edges from one commissure to opposite sinus (yellow line) or from one sinus to another sinus (red line), as shown in the large image (left), which is a zoomed cross-sectional view of the aortic root at the sinus of Valsalva level using a double oblique image for orientation (shown in the right panel).

complex. Although other techniques use the inner edge–to–inner edge approach, there are currently insufﬁcient data to warrant a change for echocardiography. Available data suggest that the echocardiographic leading edge–to–leading edge approach produces values comparable with those produced by the inner edge–to–inner edge approach on CT and MRI, is reproducible, and links to a large body of historical and prognostic data that have long guided clinical decision making.
For all modalities, it is desirable, whenever possible, to specify the locations of measurements, by referencing them to a given landmark. For example, with TEE, a measurement of the maximal diameter of the ascending aorta may be reported by its distance from the STJ. In the descending thoracic aorta, reference to the location of a measurement or abnormality is usually made by its distance from the incisors. Similar attempts should be made for measurements and ﬁndings with CT and MRI.
2. Geometry of Different Aortic Segments: Impact on Measurements. Accurate and reproducible measurement of aortic diameter or cross-sectional area in a given segment requires three measurements of its diameter perpendicular to the long axis. In most cases, the largest correctly oriented measurement is reported.
a. Aortic Annulus.–Although the aortic annulus is approximately circular in children and young adults, it may become elliptical in older adults. Thus, 3D imaging by CT or echocardiography or 2D imaging in multiple planes (e.g., long-axis or sagittal and coronal planes) is required to measure a diameter that is accurate enough to be used when selecting patients for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (Figure 6).

b. Sinuses of Valsalva and STJ.–Aortic root diameter can be measured perpendicular to its long axis by 2D echocardiography or in analogous nontrue coronal and sagittal plane by MRI or CT. The variability in this measurement resulting from the orientation of the aortic root is overcome by choosing the largest diameter measured from the right coronary sinus of Valsalva to the posterior (usually noncoronary) sinus, parallel to the aortic annulus and perpendicular to the long axis of the proximal aorta in several slightly differently oriented long-axis views. Failure to search for the largest correctly oriented measurement can lead to underestimation of aortic root diameter. Aortic root diameter is commonly measured by CT or MRI between the inner edges from commissure to opposite sinus (Figure 7). Diameters measured using the sinus-to-sinus method are generally a mean of 2 mm larger than those measured by the sinus-tocommissure method4,7 (Figure 8). However, using the sinus-to-sinus method has several advantages, including the ease of detecting cusp margins in computed tomographic or MRI transverse planes, close agreement with echocardiographic measurements, and greater feasibility in bicuspid valves. Thus, for aortic measurements by CT and MRI, it is recommended to average the three sinus-to-sinus measurements in end-diastole in the sinus-of-Valsalva plane. When the sinuses are unusually asymmetric, it may be preferable to report the three measurements individually.
c. Ascending Aorta and More Distal Segments.–The same basic principles apply to obtaining correct measurements of the other aortic segments. Conventional imaging by all modalities and techniques can be used to measure the diameter of aortic segments that are oriented along the long axis of the body. However, the necessity to avoid oblique imaging that can overestimate the aortic diameter applies to the

aortic arch and to portions of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta that may take a tortuous course (Figure 9).
We emphasize that there is no standardized method for measuring the aorta across imaging modalities (echocardiography, CT, MRI, aortography). Although one of the major goals of this writing committee was to provide a uniform and universally accepted method to minimize differences among these various imaging modalities, no consensus could be reached. After much consideration, it is recommended that echocardiographic measurements continue to be made from leading edge to leading edge. Although other techniques use inner edge–to–inner edge or outer edge–to–outer edge approaches, there are currently insufﬁcient data to warrant a change for echocardiography. Available data suggest that the echocardiographic leading edge–to–leading edge approach gives larger measurements compared with the inner edge–to–inner edge approach on CT (average difference, 2 mm), and the leading edge–to–leading edge method links to a large body of historical and, more important, prognostic data that inﬂuence decision making.8 Out of concern that patient management might be adversely affected (i.e., intervention might be delayed, leading to a catastrophic complication such as rupture or dissection) by switching to a new protocol that would lead to a smaller measurement, it was decided to continue to recommend the leading edge–to–leading edge approach.
C. Aortic Physiology and Function
The aorta functions as both a conduit and a reservoir. Its elastic properties allow it to expand in systole and recoil during diastole. Thus, under normal conditions, a large proportion (up to 50%) of the left ventricular stroke volume is stored in the aorta (mainly in the ascending aorta) at end-systole, and the stored blood is then propelled forward during diastole into the peripheral circulation. This reservoir function is important for maintaining blood ﬂow and arterial pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. The thoracic aorta is more distensible

Figure 9 Diagram illustrating the potential pitfall of obtaining an oblique cut resulting in an ‘‘ellipsoid’’ cross-section that overestimates the true diameter. This is especially a problem when the descending aorta is tortuous.
than the abdominal aorta because its media contains more elastin. Aortic distensibility declines with age and as a result of premature degeneration in elastin and collagen associated with some disease states.30 During left ventricular systole, this loss of aortic wall compliance results in increased systolic pressure and pulse pressure and, in turn, aortic dilatation and lengthening. The compliance of the aortic wall may be estimated by assessing change in aortic volume in relation to the simultaneous change in aortic pressure. This may be assessed locally by diameter or area change through the cardiac cycle in relation to pressure change (e.g., distensibility) or regionally by determination of the velocity of the pulse wave.
1. Local Indices of Aortic Function. Techniques that provide accurate deﬁnition of the aortic diameter or volume in systole and diastole can be used to evaluate the elastic properties of the aorta. The most commonly applied indices for clinical purposes are aortic distensibility and the stiffness index, which is less dependent on blood pressure. Aortic distensibility and the stiffness index can be determined from the changes in the aortic diameter from systole to diastole and from changes in the arterial pressure using the following formula:
DistensibilityÀ10À3$mm HgÀ1Á ¼ ArAeraedaiassytoslteo$lePÀulAserepardeiasstsoulere$1; 000:
For these calculations, the pulse pressure should be measured ideally at the same level of the aorta at which the aortic diameter is

This diagram illustrates the four sites at which measurements are recommended: 1 = aortic valve annulus (hinge point of aortic leaﬂets), 2 = aortic root at sinuses of Valsalva (maximal diameter, usually midpoint), 3 = STJ, 4 = proximal tubular portion of the ascending aorta.

measured. In clinical practice, however, brachial artery pressure can be used, even though the pulse pressure obtained from the brachial artery may be slightly higher than that obtained from the aorta because of the ampliﬁcation phenomenon, which is more apparent in young individuals.31
2. Regional Indices of Aortic Stiffness: Pulsewave Velocity (PWV). PWV is deﬁned as the longitudinal speed of the pulsewave in the aorta. PWV is inversely related to aortic elasticity. Hence, a stiffer aorta will conduct the pulsewave faster than a more compliant aorta. Central pressure, at the level of the ascending aorta, is produced as a combination of the antegrade wave from the left ventricle and the retrograde ‘‘reﬂective’’ waves from the periphery. In young individuals, because the aorta is more elastic, the pulsewave speed is low, so the retrograde ﬂow arrives in the proximal aorta during diastole. As a result of aortic stiffening, the PWV increases, and the retrograde ﬂow arrives in the proximal aorta earlier in systole, leading to a greater LV afterload and decreased diastolic pressure.
Reported normal values for invasively determined PWV measurements in middle-aged humans are 4.4 6 0.4 m/sec in the aortic root, 5.3 6 0.2 m/sec in the proximal descending thoracic aorta, 5.7 6 0.4 m/sec in the distal thoracic descending aorta, 5.7 6 0.4 m/sec in the suprarenal abdominal aorta, and 9.2 6 0.5 m/sec in the infrarenal aorta.32

Carotid-femoral PWV is considered to be the gold-standard measure of arterial stiffness, especially because it is simple to obtain and because multiple epidemiologic studies have demonstrated its predictive value for cardiovascular events. However, the ability of a given individual’s PWV value to predict aortic events has not been previously evaluated.33 A recent expert consensus adjusted this threshold value to 10 m/sec by using the direct carotid-to-femoral distance.34 The main limitation of PWV interpretation is that it is significantly inﬂuenced by arterial blood pressure. Multimodality imaging techniques provide a unique opportunity to assess aortic PWV by the formula:

Aortic

DistanceðmmÞ Transit timeðmsecÞ

:

Echocardiography can accurately estimate the transit time between aortic levels by the subtraction of the time between a ﬁxed reference in the QRS complex and the beginning of the ﬂow at the two levels studied. Distance can be grossly estimated externally with a tape.
MRI can measure the PWV using the transit time of the ﬂow curves from a phase-contrast acquisition. Transit time can be calculated by the upslope approach, which has been described previously and correlates more with age and aortic stiffness indices than point-to-point approaches such as foot-to-foot and half-maximum methods.35 Distance can accurately be measured at the centerline of the aorta between aortic levels studied.
A normal-size aorta may be functionally abnormal. Thus, determination of aortic function may help deﬁne the nature of the underlying disease and give prognostic information in some diseases. This was emphasized by Vriz et al.,4 who stated that aortic stiffness should be taken into account when increases in aortic diameter are detected.
In summary, aortic biophysical properties can be easily and reliably assessed by imaging techniques, particularly Doppler echocardiography and phase-contrast MRI. This evaluation may provide

important pathophysiologic and prognostic information that may have clinical implications both in disease states and in the general population.

II. IMAGING TECHNIQUES

A. Chest X-Ray (CXR)
Most articles describing the use of imaging to evaluate patients with suspected AAS have focused on the role of CT, MRI, echocardiography, and aortography. Although routine CXR rarely provides a deﬁnitive diagnosis, it can provide several important diagnostic clues to aortic diseases that prompt further evaluation. Table 3 lists some of the common and uncommon plain CXR ﬁndings of aortic diseases.
Moreover, in cases of asymptomatic or chronic aortic diseases, CXRs may actually provide the ﬁrst clue to aortic pathology. Importantly, CXR can identify other chest disorders that may contribute to a patient’s illness (e.g., pneumonia, pneumothorax, rib fracture). Nevertheless, although CXR may be valuable, it is neither sensitive nor speciﬁc for AAS.36-38 Moreover, normal results on CXR with respect to the aorta should never prevent or delay the further diagnostic evaluation of a patient with a suspected AAS.
In summary, although useful in drawing attention to the possibility of aortic disease, its low sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and interobserver agreement limit the role of the CXR.
B. TTE The thoracic aorta should be routinely evaluated by TTE,39-42 which provides good images of the aortic root, adequate images of the ascending aorta and aortic arch in most patients, adequate images of the descending thoracic aorta in some patients, and good images of the proximal abdominal aorta. New advances in imaging quality and harmonic imaging have signiﬁcantly improved the assessment of the aorta by TTE.
The aortic root and proximal ascending aorta are best imaged in the left parasternal long-axis view. The left lung and sternum often limit imaging of the more distal portion of the ascending aorta from this transducer position. In some patients, especially those with aortic dilatation, the right parasternal long-axis view can provide supplemental information. The ascending aorta may also be visualized in the apical long-axis (apical three-chamber) and apical ﬁvechamber views and (especially in children) in modiﬁed subcostal views.
There is usually no clear echocardiographic delineation between the sinus and tubular portion of the ascending aorta, but occasionally a ﬁbrotic or sclerotic ridge, located at the STJ, is imaged. This ridge may be prominent and should not be confused with vegetation, abscess, mass, atherosclerotic plaque, dissection ﬂap, or supraaortic stenosis. The maximum diameter of the aorta is normally in the root (sinus portion), which is immediately distal to the aortic valve.
Echocardiographic measurements of the aortic root will vary in an individual patient at different levels (Figure 10).3,43,44 The aortic diameter is smallest at the annulus and largest at the mid–sinuses of Valsalva. The tubular portion of the ascending aorta is typically about 10% smaller than the diameter at the sinus level.45 The aortic arch is usually easily visualized from the suprasternal view. Portions of the ascending and descending aorta can be visualized simulta-

neously. One or more of the three arch branches can usually be imaged: the left carotid and left subclavian arteries are identiﬁed in >90% of cases and the brachiocephalic (inniminate) artery in up to 90% (Figure 11). Just distal to the left subclavian artery is the level of the ligamentum arteriosum, which is a common site of atherosclerosis, and a shelf or indentation (a ductus diverticulum) is sometimes imaged in this region.
The descending thoracic aorta is often incompletely imaged by TTE. A cross-sectional view of the descending thoracic aorta may be seen in the parasternal long-axis view, as it passes posteriorly to the left atrium near the atrioventricular groove. It can also be seen in short axis in the apical four-chamber view. By rotating the transducer 90 , a long-axis view of the midportion of the descending thoracic aorta may be obtained. A portion of the descending thoracic aorta can also be imaged from a suprasternal view. In patients with left pleural effusion, scanning from the back may also provide satisfactory views of the descending thoracic aorta. However, the distal descending thoracic aorta frequently cannot be imaged clearly because of reduced resolution in the far ﬁeld. Moreover, physical characteristics of some patients exceed the limit of ultrasound penetration.
The normal descending thoracic aorta is smaller than both the aortic root and ascending aorta. As it descends, its diameter progressively narrows from 2.5 to 2.0 cm. Larger dimensions are reported in patients with hypertension, aortic valve disease, and coronary atherosclerosis.46 The aorta is consistently about 2 mm smaller in female than it is in male subjects.47
A substantial portion of the upper abdominal aorta can be easily imaged in subcostal views, to the left of the inferior vena cava. This should be routinely performed as a part of a 2D echocardiographic study.16 Often the proximal celiac axis and the superior mesenteric artery can also be imaged. When present, aneurysmal dilatation, external compression, intra-aortic thrombi, protruding atheromas, and dissection ﬂaps can be imaged, and ﬂow patterns in the abdominal aorta can be assessed. The infrarenal abdominal aorta is best imaged as part of an abdominal ultrasound examination by use of a linear array probe.
In summary, to reliably evaluate patients with suspected aortic disease, the entire thoracic aorta must be imaged well. This is possible in some, but not all, patients on systematic TTE. TTE is particularly useful

for evaluating the aortic root, and the ascending aorta and arch may also be adequately visualized in patients with good acoustic windows. TTE is less helpful for evaluating the descending thoracic aorta. However, TTE is an excellent screening tool for detecting aneurysms of the upper abdominal aorta.
C. TEE
TEE, introduced clinically in the late 1980s, has had a major impact on the evaluation of numerous diseases involving the aorta. TEE has two main advantages over TTE. First, superior image quality can be obtained from the use of higher frequency transducers than are possible with TTE. Second, because of the close proximity of the esophagus to the thoracic aorta, TEE provides high-quality imaging of nearly all of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.48-50 TEE incorporates all the functionality of TTE, including 3D imaging, which can reliably interrogate cardiovascular anatomy, function, hemodynamics, and blood ﬂow. The current multiplane TEE transducer consists of a single array of crystals that can be rotated

electronically or mechanically around the long axis of the ultrasound beam in an arc of 180 . With rotation of the transducer array, multiplane TEE produces a continuum of transverse and longitudinal image planes.
1. Imaging of the Aorta. As mentioned, the anatomic proximity of the thoracic aorta and the esophagus allows superb visualization of the aorta using TEE. The multiplane transesophageal echocardiographic examination of the aorta is conducted as follows51: with the tip of the transesophageal echocardiographic probe in the esophagus, the ascending aorta is best visualized from a 100  to 140  view: the image is analogous to the transthoracic echocardiographic parasternal long-axis view (but ‘‘ﬂipped’’ upside down if the transesophageal echocardiographic probe ‘‘bang’’ is at the top). This view can be optimized by carefully rotating the transducer between 100  and 140 . Short-axis views of the aortic root and ascending aorta can be obtained from the 45  to 60  angle, usually with an anteﬂexed probe. From the midesophagus at 0 , the probe needs to be rotated posteriorly to obtain short-axis images of the descending thoracic aorta.

regarding the clinical application of this novel technology to the thoracic aorta.57
Moreover, 3D TEE has some limitations. Like 2D TEE, it often fails to adequately visualize the distal ascending aorta and the aortic arch and its branches, because of interposition of the trachea. In addition, spatial imaging of the thoracic aorta is limited because of the 90  image sector, which is too narrow to include long segments of the thoracic aorta and therefore limits topographic orientation. In summary, recent advances in 3D TEE provide an opportunity to reconsider the role of TEE for diagnosing and monitoring patients with aortic diseases. Future experience will be required to verify its beneﬁts and establish its value relative to CT and MRI.

Note the excellent quality of both the aortic and coronary vessels, with calciﬁed atheromatous plaques of the coronary arteries.
While keeping the thoracic aorta in view, the probe can be withdrawn to image upper thoracic levels of the descending aorta or advanced to sequentially image the lower thoracic and upper abdominal aorta. With the transducer array at 90 , a longitudinal view of the aorta can be obtained.
By advancing the probe into the stomach, the proximal portion of the abdominal aorta and the celiac trunk can be seen. The mid and distal abdominal aorta are usually not seen because of difﬁculty maintaining good contact with the mucosa of the stomach. To obtain images of the arch, the transesophageal echocardiographic probe needs to be facing posteriorly and withdrawn from the midesophagus. With the transducer array at 90 , a short-axis view of the transverse arch can be obtained. It is usually possible to visualize the takeoff of the left subclavian artery, but the left common carotid and brachiocephalic arteries can be difﬁcult or impossible to image and usually require careful clockwise rotation of the probe. A portion of the distal ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch may not be visible because of interposition of the trachea. This ‘‘blind spot’’ can be partially resolved with longitudinal views. An additional view, the deep transgastric view, can sometimes image the entire ascending aorta and often the proximal arch (Figure 12).

E. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)
IVUS is performed by introducing a miniature, high-frequency (10–30 MHz) ultrasound transducer mounted on the tip of a disposable catheter, through a large arterial (usually femoral) sheath, and advanced over conventional guidewires using ﬂuoroscopic guidance. Less commonly, the IVUS imaging catheter can be inserted into the femoral vein, navigated into the inferior vena cava, and aimed at the adjacent aorta. IVUS produces an axial view that is a 360  real-time image. Consecutive axial images can be obtained during a ‘‘pullback’’ of the ultrasound catheter. This procedure can be safely performed in a few minutes.58
Because of its intraluminal position, IVUS permits visualization of the aortic wall from the inside. This intraluminal perspective can provide information that supplements the other imaging modalities.59-62 Using the pullback technique, luminal diameter, cross-sectional area, and wall thickness can be measured. In addition to providing measurements, IVUS also provides qualitative information on nearly all aortic pathologies, including aortic aneurysms, aortic dissections, atherosclerosis, penetrating ulcers, and traumatic lesions (Figures 13 and 14). Unlike TEE, IVUS can also determine the dissection characteristics in the abdominal aorta.
1. Limitations. The normal aorta appears on IVUS as a circular crosssectional image with an intact wall and a clear lumen. The ultrasound catheter and the guidewire are seen within the lumen. In some instances, it can be difﬁcult to obtain complete cross-sectional images of the aorta within a single frame of the image display at the arch and locations where the aorta is signiﬁcantly dilated, because of difﬁculty maintaining the ultrasound catheter in a central and coaxial orientation and because of the limited penetration with high-frequency transducers. This limitation can be partially overcome by periodic reorientation of the ultrasound catheters. There are also concerns with IVUS measurements. Off-center measurements or those taken in tortuous portions of the aorta (tangential measurements on a curve) do not reﬂect a true centerline diameter, may provide an oblique slice, and are less accurate than centerline computed tomographic measurements.63 Another major limitation of IVUS is that it lacks Doppler capabilities (color Doppler can detect ﬂow into small arteries, false luminal ﬂow, and endoleaks). Last, the high cost of the disposable transducers and invasive nature of the technique limit IVUS for most clinical applications other than guidance of endovascular procedures.

D. Three-Dimensional Echocardiography
Real-time 3D TEE, a relatively new technology, appears to offer some advantages over 2D TEE in a growing number of clinical applications.52-56 However, as of this writing, there is limited information

F. CT

used imaging techniques for diagnosis and follow-up of aortic condi-
tions in acute as well as chronic presentations. This popularity reﬂects
its widespread availability, accuracy, and applicability, even for critically
ill patients or those with relative contraindications to MRI such as per-
manent pacemakers and deﬁbrillators. Multidetector CT (MDCT) pro-
vides extensive z-axis coverage (in the long axis of the body), with high
spatial resolution images acquired at modest radiation exposure within a scan time lasting a few seconds.1,64 Furthermore, CTA allows
simultaneous imaging of vascular structures, including the vessel wall and of solid viscera.65 The minimization of operator variability and
the capacity of delayed reprocessing of source images make it an ideal technique for comparative follow-up studies.1,64
The latest innovations in clinical practice include electrocardiographically gated66 aortic computed tomographic studies leading to
high-quality, precise imaging of the ascending aorta, as well as simultaneous evaluation of the coronary arteries67 (Figure 15).
Electrocardiographically gated CTA adds valuable information in the study of aortic pathology involving the aortic root and valve,68 in congenital heart disease,69 for simultaneous aortocoronary evaluation,66 for planning of endovascular therapy,68,70 for imaging of the postsurgical ascending aorta,71 and to show dynamic changes of true luminal compression in aortic dissection.72
The main drawbacks of CTare the use of ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast media (ICM).73 Using optimal acquisition methods, large
reductions in ionizing radiation dose can be achieved. These include
the use of tube current modulation, prospective electrocardiographically

triggered acquisitions, or tube voltage reductions to 80 to 100 kV. Radiation dose becomes most relevant in younger men and premenopausal women. Contrast-associated nephropathy74 may be avoided or signiﬁcantly decreased by proper patient hydration and use of the minimum volume of low- or iso-osmolar ICM.75 The rate of adverse reactions to low-osmolar ICM in CT is approximately 0.15%, with most cases self-resolving and mild.76 Among patients with renal insufﬁciency, the rates of contrast-associated nephropathy are low. Pooled data from recently published prospective studies have shown an overall rate of contrast-associated nephropathy of 5% after intravenous injection of ICM in 1,075 patients with renal insufﬁciency, with no serious adverse outcomes (dialysis or death).74
The current generation of computed tomographic scanners is able to signiﬁcantly decrease the effective radiation dose and the total volume of ICM required for aortic imaging.77 Additionally, CT for follow-up of aortic expansion may be performed without ICM, relying on noncontrast images only.

supra-aortic vessels to the femoral arteries is needed for evaluation before transthoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), but as a general rule the scan length (anatomic scan range) on CTA should be individually tailored to avoid unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation.1
i. Noncontrast CT before Aortography In the acute setting of a suspected AAS, it is important to initiate the protocol by a noncontrast thoracic computed tomographic scan to rule out IMH. This scan identiﬁes concentrated hemoglobin in recently extravasated blood within the aortic wall that shows a characteristically high computed tomographic density (40–70 Hounsﬁeld units),78 facilitates the characterization of the hematoma,79 can identify vascular calciﬁcations, and provides a baseline examination for postcontrast evaluation.
ii. Electrocardiographically Gated CTA Motion artifacts involving the thoracic aorta are evident in most (92%) standard nongated computed tomographic angiograms. Because of the limited temporal resolution of CT, imaging artifacts arising from the peduncular motion of the heart, the circular distension of the pulsewave, aortic distensibility, and the hemodynamic state may appear as a ‘‘double aortic wall’’ on standard nongated CTA.8,23,24,80,81 This ﬁnding may also lead to a false-positive diagnosis of a dissection ﬂap64,67,80 and impair accurate measurement of the aortic root and ascending aorta.67,82
Prospective or retrospective synchronization of data acquisition with the electrocardiographic tracing eliminates these artifacts, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis and reproducibility of aortic size measurements.67 Low-dose prospective electrocardiographically gated CT protocols have the advantage of decreased radiation exposure compared with the standard technique.83
iii. Thoracoabdominal CT after Aortography A late thoracoabdominal scan ($50 msec after bolus injection) improves the detection

iv. Exposure to Ionizing Radiation Radiation minimization protocols include limiting scan range, prospectively electrocardiographically triggered acquisitions,66 and using low tube voltage (80–100 kV) for low–body weight patients (<85 kg) without risking loss of diagnostic quality.77 Application of iterative reconstruction algorithms provide the opportunity for even larger reductions in scan acquisition parameters. Despite progress in radiation reduction, the use of alternative methods such as MRI and echocardiography remains a consideration for serial studies.1
v. Measurements In contrast with other aortic imaging techniques, CTA depicts the aortic wall, thereby permitting measurement of both the inner-inner (luminal) and outer-outer (total) aortic diameters. Imaging artifacts from the highly contrasted lumen frequently impair the visualization of a thin and healthy wall in the ascending aorta.24
Multiplanar reconstruction of the axial source data can create aortic images in a plane perpendicular to the aortic lumen direction (double-oblique or true short-axis images of the aorta; see Figures 16 and 17). This method corrects shape distortions introduced by aortic tortuosity.8,86,87 In cases of noncircular aortic shape, both major and minor diameters should be measured. The

manual procedure of double-oblique images is time consuming and may add observer variability.88 Automated aortic segmentation
software is available at many institutions but, like most automated
software, has limitations and requires manual adjustment.
The measurement technique must be highly reproducible to
correctly assess follow-up studies. Accurate assessment of aortic
morphologic changes can be achieved by side-by-side comparison of
source axial images from two or more serial computed tomographic
aortographic examinations with anatomic landmark synchronization and a slice thickness #1 mm. Electrocardiographically gated or triggered imaging is an additional reﬁnement that further reduces variability, with a maximum interobserver variability of 61.2 mm in the ascending aorta.89 Measures in the axial plane are valid only for aortic segments
with a circular shape and craniocaudal axis, like the midascending and the descending aorta.1 Distortion in the axial image introduced by aortic tortuosity may be minimized by measuring the lesser diameter.90
Interobserver variability is always higher than intraobserver variability,91,92 suggesting that follow-up of aortic disease in a speciﬁc patient should be performed by a single experienced observer.88,89
In summary, CTA is one of the most used techniques in the assess-
ment of aortic diseases. Advantages of CTA over other imaging

Figure 21 MIP image obtained from MRA in a 60-year-old man with a dilated ascending aorta (large yellow arrow). There was suspicion of coarctation of the descending aorta raised by surface echocardiographic imaging; however, MRA revealed a mild kink in the isthmus without signiﬁcant stenosis (large red arrow) and normal-sized intercostal (small red arrow) and internal mammary (small yellow arrow) arteries, results consistent with pseudocoarctation.
modalities include the short time required for image acquisition and processing, the ability to obtain a complete 3D data set of the entire aorta, and its availability. Moreover, MDCT permits a correct evaluation of the coronary arteries and aortic branch disease. Its main drawbacks are the radiation exposure and need for contrast administration.
G. MRI
MRI is a versatile tool for assessing the aorta and aorta-related pathologies. This imaging modality can be used to deﬁne the location and extent of aneurysms, aortic wall ulceration, and dissections and to demonstrate areas of wall thickening related to aortitis or IMH. MRI can also be used for preoperative and postoperative evaluation of the aorta and adjacent structures. Additionally, MRI can provide functional data, including quantiﬁcation of forward and reverse aortic ﬂow, assessment of aortic wall stiffness and compliance, and aortic leaﬂet morphology and motion (Figure 18). All of this information is obtainable without the burden of ionizing radiation and, in some instances, without the need for intravenous contrast.
MR images are based on the signal collected from hydrogen nuclei,93 which align and process along the axis of the magnetic ﬁeld when a patient enters the scanner. This precession can be altered by applying magnetic ﬁeld pulses in a controlled fashion to create ‘‘pulse sequences.’’ After these pulse sequences are applied, the signal from the hydrogen nuclei is measured and then processed to produce MR images. The versatility of MRI can be attributed to the multiple types of pulse sequences that can be used to deﬁne structure, characterize tissue, and quantify function.

1. Black-Blood Sequences. Black-blood MRI sequences, acquired with spin-echo techniques, and often including inversion recovery pulses, are useful for deﬁning morphology across a spectrum of aortic conditions without the need for intravascular contrast medium.94-97 With these sequences, the use of multiple radiofrequency pulses nulls the signal from moving blood, causing the dark blood appearance; mobile protons in stable or slowly moving structures (e.g., aortic wall) provide the signal in the image. Aortic wall morphology can be deﬁned and tissue characterized with T1- and T2-weighted sequences and their variants, including T2-weighted dark-blood techniques and T2 turbo spin-echo and short-tau inversion recovery sequences (Figure 19).98-100 Each of these imaging protocols has relative strengths and limitations; for example, T2-weighted MRI is sensitive to areas of increased water content, as is often noted in pathologic conditions, but is limited by relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. MRI of the thoracic aorta can be obtained with high spatial resolution, with in-plane resolution typically in the range of 1.5 Â 1.5 mm and submillimeter acquisition achievable with more specialized MRI sequences.101,102
2. Cine MRI Sequences. Bright-blood imaging with approaches such as steady-state free precession and gradient-echo techniques is useful for obtaining high–temporal resolution cine images of ﬂow in the aorta. In these images, the blood pool is bright compared with the adjacent aortic wall, which is typically intermediate in signal. Cine imaging can demonstrate ﬂow within aortic lumens (true or false), and areas of low signal caused by intravoxel dephasing can be seen with complex ﬂow patterns associated with valvular stenosis or regurgitation (Figure 20).103
3. Flow Mapping. Velocity-encoded phase-contrast imaging can be used to quantify aortic ﬂow. The phase-contrast technique is based on the fact that protons undergo a change in phase that is proportional to velocity when they pass through a magnetic ﬁeld gradient consisting of equal pulses that are of opposite polarity and slightly offset in time. Blood ﬂow can be quantiﬁed by integrating these measured velocities within the aortic lumen throughout the cardiac cycle with values that have shown strong agreement with phantom models and other measurement approaches.104 Phase-contrast imaging of the aorta can be used to assess forward ﬂow and stenotic and regurgitant valves105,106 and can aid in assessment of congenital heart disease.107 Phasecontrast imaging is typically acquired in a single in-plane or through-plane direction, with some applications allowing ﬂow encoding in multiple directions.108,109
4. Contrast-Enhanced MR Angiography (MRA). Contrastenhanced MRA can provide a 3D data set of the aorta and branch vessels, allowing complex anatomy and postoperative changes to be depicted through postprocessing techniques such as maximum-intensity projection and multiplanar reformatting (Figure 21). In patients with contraindications to contrast or in cases of difﬁcult intravenous access, a 3D angiogram of the aorta can still be obtained with unenhanced segmented steady-state free precession angiography.110 When precise dimensions of the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta are needed, electrocardiographically gated techniques can be used.101,110 Improved scanning speed allows timeresolved MRA.111 Although contrast timing for contrast-enhanced MRA can be a challenge, particularly in the concurrent assessment of the aorta and pulmonary arteries or veins, the use of newer blood-pool contrast agents can circumvent the limitations of traditional interstitial gadolinium contrast agents and in conjunction with

electrocardiographic and respiratory gating has been shown to increase vessel sharpness and reduce artifacts.112
MRI may also be used as a tool to investigate aortic physiology. Quantiﬁcation of stiffness, an important predictor of cardiovascular outcome, can be obtained with pulsewave measurements from high–temporal resolution cine imaging.113 MRI can provide insight into the elastic properties of the aorta, quantify the resultant blood ﬂow,114 and estimate aortic wall shear stress.115
5. Artifacts. Similar to echocardiographic imaging, MRI artifacts occur. Consequently, consistently recognizing artifacts can prevent misinterpretation. The reader is referred to two excellent reviews for a detailed discussion of these.116,117

H. Invasive Aortography
Once considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of acute aortic diseases, invasive catheter-based aortography has largely been replaced by less invasive techniques, including CT, MRI, and TEE.42,118-124 These noninvasive imaging modalities provide higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity for detecting AAS and enable the assessment of aortic wall pathologies that are not seen on lumenograms (as obtained by contrast aortography). In addition, CT, MRI, and TEE also provide greater sensitivity in detecting supporting ﬁndings such as pericardial or pleural hemorrhage or effusion. Moreover, aortography is time consuming and incurs a risk for contrast-induced nephropathy. Thus, invasive aortography

no longer has a role as a primary diagnostic modality for AAS.42,120-122,124
Although invasive aortography has been replaced for diagnostic purposes, it continues to be useful to guide endovascular procedures and to screen for endoleakage. Intraprocedural contrast aortography is often essential to identify aortic side branches and provide important landmarks during the endovascular procedure. Figure 22 reveals the resolution of distal dynamic aortic obstruction after a stent graft was placed in a type B dissection. IVUS is an alternative imaging technique during endovascular procedures.59,60,62,125,126

I. Comparison of Imaging Techniques
With advances in imaging technology, there are now multiple modalities well suited to imaging the thoracic aorta, including CTA, MRA, echocardiography, and aortography.1,127 No single modality is preferred for all patients or all clinical situations. Instead, the choice of imaging modality should be individualized on the basis of a patient’s clinical condition, the relevant diagnostic questions to be answered, and local institutional factors such as expertise and availability. A few pertinent comments follow.
When assessing broadly for the presence of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs), or to size such aneurysms, CTA or MRA is preferred,

as all segments of the thoracic aorta are well visualized. As well, the aorta and its branches can be displayed in multiple planar views, which permits more accurate diameter measurements than axial imaging. In addition, both modalities can provide a reconstructed, surface-shaded 3D display of the aorta, which is helpful in demonstrating the anatomic relations of the aorta and its branch vessels. In contrast, TEE is not generally preferred for routine aortic imaging, because it is semiinvasive, is relatively unpleasant for the patient, does not provide full visualization of the arch vessels, and does not permit easy identiﬁcation of landmarks when comparing serial examinations to assess aortic changes over time.
When the region of clinical interest is speciﬁcally the aortic root, such as in screening for or following Marfan syndrome, TTE may be preferred, because the aortic root is generally well visualized and easily measured, whereas on conventional nongated CTA, the aortic root may be poorly visualized because of its angulation and signiﬁcant motion artifact produced by the beating heart. On the other hand, echocardiography is less consistently able to image the distal ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta. To image these segments, CTA and MRA are preferred. Another consideration in selecting an imaging modality is the previous modality used. When following a patient with an enlarging aortic aneurysm, it is best to use the same imaging modality for future imaging, so that a comparison of one study with the next is comparing apples to apples rather than apples to oranges.
For imaging of suspected AAS, the primary consideration should be the accuracy of the imaging modality, given the serious

(e.g., emergency department radiologists). The diagnostic and practical features of each of the ﬁve common imaging modalities are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.

III. ACUTE AORTIC SYNDROMES

Figure 26 Diagram illustrating the two commonly used classiﬁcation systems for aortic dissection. In the older of the two, the DeBakey system, type I dissection originates in the ascending aorta and propagates distally to includes at least the arch and typically the descending aorta. Type II dissection, not shown (the least common type) originates in and is conﬁned to the ascending aorta. Type III dissection originates in the descending thoracic aorta (usually just distal to the left subclavian artery) and propagates distally, usually to below the diaphragm. The Stanford system, in a simpler scheme, divides dissections into two categories: those that involve the ascending aorta, regardless of the site of origin, are classiﬁed as type A, and those beginning beyond the arch vessels are classiﬁed as type B. The majority of dissections, whether type A or type B, propagate beyond the diaphragm to the iliac arteries.
consequences of false-positive and particularly of false-negative results. There have been a number of studies carried out over the past two decades comparing CTA, MRA, TEE, and aortography for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, and a recent meta-analysis by Shiga et al.122 showed that CTA, MRA, and TEE are all outstanding, with sensitivities of 98% to 100%, as shown in Figure 23. On the other hand, aortography has a sensitivity of only 88%, perhaps reﬂecting the fact that IMH often goes undetected with this technique. In the same meta-analysis, the speciﬁcity of the four imaging modalities was roughly equivalent at 94% to 98%, as shown in Figure 24. Therefore CTA, MRA, and TEE are all reasonable ﬁrst-line imaging studies to choose for this purpose.
It is important to note, however, that the research studies that evaluate the accuracy of imaging modalities are usually performed at centers of excellence and interpreted by designated experts in aortic imaging, and it is therefore reasonable to suspect that accuracy may be lower when the same imaging modalities perform in the ‘‘real-world’’ setting. Indeed, a report from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) examined this very question, and the results are shown in Figure 25.120 The real-world sensitivity of both CTA and TEE is lower than in the above meta-analysis, probably reﬂecting a lesser degree of expertise among the readers. Interestingly, the real-world sensitivity of MRA remained at 100%, which may reﬂect the fact that MR angiograms tend to be read by specialists (e.g., vascular radiologists) rather than general radiologists

A. Introduction The term AAS128 refers to the spectrum of aortic pathologies, including classic aortic dissection, IMH, penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU), and aortic aneurysm rupture (contained or not contained). Although the pathophysiology of these heterogeneous conditions differs, they are grouped because they share common features: (1) similar clinical presentation (‘‘aortic pain’’), (2) impaired integrity of the aortic wall, and (3) potential danger of aortic rupture requiring emergency attention.128-133 Moreover, some of these conditions may represent stages in the evolution of the same process. We have elected not to include, as some authors do, aortitis and traumatic aortic rupture, because they have totally distinct clinical and pathophysiologic proﬁles.128 Clinical databases, such as the IRAD, have contributed tremendously to our knowledge of these acute aortic pathologies.134
Because of the life-threatening nature of these conditions, prompt and accurate diagnosis is paramount. Misdiagnosis of these conditions, usually because of confusion with myocardial ischemia, can lead to untimely deaths. Table 6 lists some less urgent conditions that can potentially mimic AAS.
The noninvasive imaging techniques that play a fundamental role in the diagnosis and management of patients with AAS include CTA, TTE, TEE and MRI. Some patients may require more than one noninvasive imaging study and, in rare instances, invasive aortography may be necessary. Imaging is used to conﬁrm or exclude the diagnosis, determine the site(s) of involvement, delineate extension, and detect complications to plan the most appropriate management approach.
B. Aortic Dissection
1. Classiﬁcation of Aortic Dissection. Accurate classiﬁcation of aortic dissection is important because signiﬁcant differences in clinical presentation, prognosis, and management depend on the location and extent of the dissection. Figure 26 illustrates the two commonly used classiﬁcations: the DeBakey system (types I, II, and III)124,125 and the Stanford system (types A and B).126 Dissections involving the aortic arch without involving the ascending aorta are classiﬁed as type B in the Stanford system. The majority of dissections, whether type A or type B, propagate beyond the diaphragm to the iliac arteries.
The appropriate management of aortic dissections depends not only on the location of the dissection but also on the time that has elapsed between onset of the process and the patient’s presentation. Although the adjectives acute, subacute, and chronic are often applied, there is no standard deﬁnition for these time periods.135-138 There is a 24-hour ‘‘hyperacute’’ period during which dissections involving the ascending aorta carry a risk for rupture approaching 1% per hour. Studies have shown that 75% of aortic dissection–related deaths occur in the initial 2 weeks. At the opposite extreme are ‘‘old dissections’’ encountered incidentally during aortic imaging or surgery. These are clearly ‘‘chronic.’’ Hirst et al., Levinson et al., and DeBakey considered an aortic dissection to be ‘‘acute’’ when the onset of

symptoms was <2 weeks in duration at the time of diagnosis.139-143 The subsequent 2-month period was designated ‘‘subacute,’’ and beyond the second month, an aortic dissection was termed ‘‘chronic’’. We endorse this classiﬁcation, as it has some basis in pathologic observations. The extremely high initial death rate declines after 2 weeks. Moreover, friable aortic tissue extends beyond 2 weeks. By 6 to 8 weeks, the outer aortic wall has largely ‘‘healed,’’ in that it has developed scar, a reasonable marker for the beginning of the chronic stage.144 It must be acknowledged that any time-based division of ‘‘acute’’ from ‘‘subacute’’ and ‘‘subacute’’ from ‘‘chronic’’ is arbitrary.

Nevertheless, such distinctions are necessary for analyzing outcomes. Moreover, some imaging features of acute and chronic dissections are different. In chronic dissection, the dissection ﬂap tends to be thicker, more echodense, and relatively immobile (as distinct from the oscillating ﬂaps seen in acute dissection).
2. Echocardiography (TTE and TEE). The sensitivity of 2D TTE by fundamental imaging was previously reported to be only 70% to 80% for the detection of type A dissection. However, because of new transducers with improved resolution, harmonic imaging, and

contrast enhancement, the sensitivity of TTE has improved to approximately 85% on the basis of recent data from Cecconi et al.145 and Evangelista et al.146 Therefore, TTE may be of some use as the initial imaging modality, especially in the emergency room (Figure 27). In addition, TTE provides assessment of left ventricular contractility, pericardial effusion, aortic valve function, right ventricular size and function, and pulmonary artery pressure, which may facilitate the diagnosis of chest pain due to myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pericardial disease and may identify dissection complications such as aortic regurgitation (AR) in an early fashion. Moreover, the use of contrast agents may further improve the accuracy, as illustrated in Figure 28.146 Nevertheless, because of the potential catastrophic nature of type A aortic dissection, negative results on TTE should not be considered deﬁnitive, and further imaging should follow.
Moreover, TTE is less sensitive for the diagnosis of type B dissection, because the descending thoracic aorta (located farther from the transducer) is imaged less easily and accurately. Therefore, although TTE may be diagnostic in many instances, its role is predom-

inantly that of a screening procedure. TEE, on the other hand, is highly accurate for establishing the diagnosis of both type A and type B acute aortic dissection. Since the landmark multicenter European Cooperative Study,119 several additional studies have demonstrated the high accuracy of TEE, with sensitivity approaching 100%.42,147-150
a. Echocardiographic Findings.–The diagnostic hallmark of aortic dissection is a mobile dissection ﬂap that separates the true and false lumens (Figure 29). Important features of the dissection ﬂap include oscillation or motion that is independent of the aorta itself, visualization in more than one view, and clear distinction from reverberations from other structures, such as a calciﬁed aortic wall, catheter in the right ventricular outﬂow tract, pacemaker wire, or pericardial ﬂuid in the transverse oblique sinus.
The true and false lumens can almost always be differentiated. In the descending thoracic aorta, the false lumen is usually larger than the true lumen. The dissection ﬂap typically moves toward the false lumen in systole (systolic expansion of the true lumen) and toward the true lumen in diastole (diastolic expansion of the false lumen),

sometimes causing compression of the true lumen. Moreover, the characteristics of blood ﬂow vary in the true and false lumens. In the true lumen, antegrade systolic ﬂow is rapid enough to create brighter shades of red or blue on color Doppler. In contrast, ﬂow in the false lumen is generally slower, producing duller colors. In fact, ﬂow in the false lumen may be absent or in the opposite direction (retrograde) to that of the true lumen. The sluggish ﬂow in the false lumen may result in the presence of spontaneous echo contrast, sometimes referred to as ‘‘smoke.’’ The false lumen may also contain variable degrees of thrombus. Additional ﬁndings in patients with aortic dissection include dilatation of the aorta, compression of the left atrium, AR, pericardial and/or pleural effusion, and involvement of the coronary arteries. Table 7 summarizes the main echocardiographic ﬁndings in aortic dissection. Three-dimensional TEE may provide information beyond what can be obtained with 2D TEE.151 For example, the size of the entry tear size and its relationship to surrounding structures may be shown in greater detail, allowing better morphologic and dynamic evaluation of aortic dissection (Figure 30). Such information may be particularly helpful when the ﬂap spirals around the long axis of the aorta. Moreover, 3D TEE demonstrates the dissection ﬂap not as a linear structure but as a sheet of tissue of variable thickness in the long, short, or oblique axis. This may make it possible to distinguish a true dissection ﬂap from an artifact when it is relatively immobile. In addition, multiplane 3D TEE provides a more rapid and accurate evaluation of the aortic arch than 2D TEE.
b. Detection of Complications.–AR occurs in approximately 50% of patients with type A aortic dissection. The presence, severity, and mechanism(s) of AR may inﬂuence surgical decision making and aid the surgeon in deciding whether to spare, repair, or replace the aortic valve.148,152,153 The mechanisms of AR are listed in Table 8, and several of these are illustrated in Figure 31. These mechanisms will be discussed in greater detail in section III.B.6, ‘‘Use of TEE to Guide Surgery for Type A Aortic Dissection.’’
A pericardial effusion in an ascending aortic dissection is an indicator of poor prognosis and suggests rupture of the false lumen in the pericardium. Echocardiography is the best diagnostic technique for estimating the presence and severity of tamponade. Periaortic hematoma and pleural effusion are best diagnosed by CT. The presence of periaortic hematoma has also been related to increased mortality.154,155
TEE is capable of imaging the ostia and proximal segments of the coronary arteries in nearly all patients and may demonstrate coronary involvement due to dissection (ﬂap invagination into the coronary ostium and origin of coronary ostium from the false lumen).148 Color Doppler is useful for verifying normal or abnormal or absent ﬂow into the proximal coronary arteries. Detection of segmental wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle by TTE or TEE may

also help identify this complication. Color Doppler also reveals reentry sites (often multiple, as in Figure 32), which explain why the false lumen often remains patent over time.
c. Limitations of TEE.–The limitations of TEE for evaluating patients with aortic dissection are few but deserve mention. Interposition of the trachea between the ascending aorta and the esophagus limits visualization of the distal ascending aorta and proximal arch. In a small number of patients, the dissection may be limited to this area, making detection more difﬁcult. In addition, the cerebral vessels (especially the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries) can be difﬁcult to image by TEE. Moreover, the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery cannot be consistently imaged by TEE, and CT is considered the gold standard for detecting complications below the diaphragm. Last, TEE depends largely on operator skill for image acquisition and interpretation. Reverberation artifacts, especially in the ascending aorta, can mimic a dissection ﬂap and result in a false-positive diagnosis.156-159 Knowledge of mediastinal and para-aortic tissues (e.g., the hemiazygos sheath, the thoracic venous anatomy and common anatomic variants) is essential.
3. CT. Data from the IRAD published in 2000 showed that among 464 patients with acute aortic dissections (62% with type A), nearly two-thirds underwent CTA as the initial diagnostic imaging. The computed tomographic data in this study were acquired on older generation scanners, which may explain the fact that most patients underwent several imaging tests (average, 1.8 tests).129
A more recent IRAD publication, now including 894 patients, showed that the ‘‘quickest diagnostic times’’ were achieved when the initial test was CT, whereas the initial use of MRI or catheterbased aortography resulted in signiﬁcantly longer diagnostic times.160
Today, newer generation modern multidetector computed tomographic scanners are ubiquitous even in remote-area hospitals throughout the United States and Europe and are usually staffed and readily available 24 hours a day. In 2007, according to 2011 health data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, there existed 34.3 computed tomographic scanners per million population in the United States, and 185 computed tomographic examinations were performed per 1,000 patients in US hospitals.
Computed tomographic angiographic protocols are robust and relatively operator independent. Computed tomographic angiographic protocols that are designed to exclude dissections typically begin with low-dose noncontrast CT to exclude the possibility of IMH, followed by contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography. The coverage includes the entire thorax, abdomen, and pelvis to allow delineation of the extent of a ﬂap and its extension into branch vessels and to evaluate for end-organ ischemia (e.g., bowel or kidneys), and possible extravasation.1 Examples of computed tomographic angiography are illustrated in Figures 33 and 34.
Diagnostic accuracy is extremely high for the exclusion of aortic dissection (98%–100%).122,161,162 However, false positives for the detection of type A dissection near the aortic arch may infrequently occur with older generation computed tomographic scanners, which may lead to unnecessary operations.163-166 Single-slice spiral computed tomographic scanners and early-generation multidetector computed tomographic scanners frequently demonstrate pulsation artifact in the ascending aorta, which occasionally may mimic type A dissection (pseudoﬂaps).80,164,165 However, aortic pulsation artifact and pseudoﬂaps can be completely eliminated with the use

of electrocardiographically gated computed tomographic angiographic acquisitions.167,168 Therefore, it is advisable to use electrocardiographic gating or triggering if ascending aortic pathology is suspected.80,167,169,170 False-positive results on CT leading to unnecessary surgery for aortic dissection have not been reported to date with the use of newer generation electrocardiographically gated multidetector computed tomographic angiographic scans.
Surgery or transcatheter intervention in type B dissection may be indicated if there is occlusion of major aortic branches leading to end-organ ischemia or expansion of the aortic diameter or interval extension of the dissection ﬂap.171 MDCTallows imaging of the entire aorta and iliac system within seconds and allows delineating the intimal ﬂap extension into aortic arch vessels and the abdominal aorta and its branches as well as the iliac system, which may determine the feasibility of stent-graft repair.170,172 Entry and reentry sites, aortic diameters, and the relationships between true and false lumen can be deﬁned using multiplanar multidetector computed tomographic reformations. MDCT also allows the determination of end-organ perfusion, such as asymmetric or absent enhancement of kidneys in case of renal artery occlusion.72,167
Given the multiplanar reformation capabilities that, unlike MRI, can be applied post hoc, and 3D imaging capabilities, CT has

extremely high retest reliability for measurement of aortic diameters on follow-up scans. The multiplanar reconstruction capabilities facilitate endovascular treatment planning and may allow the determination of proximal fenestrations that may be amenable to endovascular repair.173 Because determination of these features is important, reporting of the extension of dissection and aneurysms into branch vessels and secondary end-organ hypoperfusion are considered ‘‘essential elements’’ of aortic imaging reports.1 Gated MDCT may determine proximal extent of the ﬂap into coronary artery ostia, or the aortic valve, as well as presence of pericardial effusion or hemopericardium.168
Gated MDCT may simultaneously exclude the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease in acute dissections,174 as well as coronary artery dissection and aortic valve tears.167,170,175 In addition, combination of a gated or triggered thoracic computed tomographic angiographic acquisition with a nongated abdominal and pelvic acquisition is feasible at low radiation doses.172,176-178
Further dose reduction using axial prospective electrocardiographic triggering (compared with spiral retrospective gating) computed tomographic angiography at a tube potential of 100 kV allows the further reduction of radiation doses without impairment of image quality of the aorta or coronary arteries.179
The ‘‘triple rule-out’’ protocol for assessing acute chest pain in the emergency room is rarely needed and is neither technically suitable nor medically necessary on a routine basis. Optimal protocols for coronary CT angiography, for pulmonary embolism, and for aortic dissection differ, and ‘‘triple rule-out’’ CT is not optimal for all three. Given the increased radiation and contrast exposure and the lack of accurate diagnostic data for aortic dissection, there are no grounds to recommend triple rule-out CT for this condition. If there is a reasonable clinical suspicion for aortic dissection, then the highest quality study for this speciﬁc indication should be performed.180,181
In summary, CT angiography is readily available throughout the United States and Europe; is most often the ﬁrst imaging test when acute aortic dissection is suspected; has extremely high diagnostic accuracy; allows the evaluation of the entire aorta and its branches, the coronary arteries, the aortic valve, and the pericardium; and results in the shortest time to diagnosis compared with other imaging modalities, therefore allowing rapid initiation of therapy. Disadvantages of CT include the need for iodinated contrast material and ionizing radiation, although substantial dose reductions have recently been achieved with newer hardware technology and imaging protocols, and this issue may be of less concern in the setting of AAS.

The comparison is performed by synchronizing thin (0.75-mm) axial images of the baseline and follow-up computed tomographic aortograms. The images show an expansion of the false lumen (asterisk) with compression of the true lumen, with an overall mild external expansion of the dissected descending thoracic aorta. Note the similarity of mediastinal and posterior thoracic wall anatomic markers.

4. MRI of Aortic Dissection. Early identiﬁcation of aortic dissection and precise characterization of anatomic details are critical for clinical and surgical management of this condition.182 Imaging of suspected dissection should address not only the presence of a dissection ﬂap and its extent but also the entry and reentry points, presence and severity of aortic insufﬁciency, and ﬂow into arch and visceral branch vessels. MRI, which can address all of these issues noninvasively, provides high spatial and contrast resolution and functional assessment with an imaging time of 20 to 30 min. Speciﬁcally, MRI has very high sensitivity (97%–100%) and speciﬁcity (94%–100%) for

diagnosing dissection.161,183,184 MRI also provides imaging without the burden of ionizing radiation, an important consideration for patients who undergo serial assessments of a known aortic dissection.
MRI does have potential limitations in this patient population. Although the scan times for MRI are relatively short, they are signiﬁcantly longer than the scan times for CT angiography. Additionally, physiologic waveforms are challenging to obtain within the MRI scanner environment.185,186 Although cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and oximetry can be monitored with MRI-appropriate equipment, caring for patients within an MRI scanning area can be difﬁcult in

emergent or unstable clinical scenarios that may be associated with aortic dissection.
A combination of dark-blood and bright-blood images in axial and oblique planes oriented to the aorta allows the detection and characterization of intimal ﬂaps. True and false lumens can be differentiated by patterns of ﬂow and by anatomic features (Figures 35 and 36).185 The false lumen can often be identiﬁed on spin-echo images by a higher intraluminal signal intensity attributable to slower ﬂow and may be characterized by web-like remnants of dissected media.187 Cine bright-blood imaging can also be used to directly visualize ﬂow patterns within true and false lumens. Associated anatomic ﬁndings outside of the aorta on MRI may also be of interest, such as high signal intensity within pericardial effusion on dark-blood imaging, indicating the possibility of the ascending aorta rupturing into the pericardial space.188 Phase-contrast imaging can provide ﬂow quantiﬁcation of aortic insufﬁciency associated with dissection and can also allow deﬁnition of entry and reentry sites and differentiation of slow ﬂow and thrombus in the false lumen. Newer 3D phasecontrast approaches have shown promise in further deﬁning the ﬂow characteristics and associated parameters of aortic dissection, such as wall stress.189
Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA provides 3D data, results that allow postprocessing and detailed assessment of aortic and large-branch vessel anatomy in cases of dissection.190 The dynamics of aortic ﬂow can also be evaluated with time-resolved MRA.191 Imaging with blood-pool contrast agents allows steady-state phase scanning,

which can improve spatial resolution and better demonstrate the amount of thrombus within the false lumen.192
5. Imaging Algorithm. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that is associated with high early mortality and therefore requires prompt and accurate diagnosis. Numerous publications have sought to establish the relative merits of CT, TEE, and MRI as ﬁrst-line imaging modalities. In truth, each diagnostic method has its strengths and weakness, as previously discussed. The optimal choice of imaging modality at a given institution should depend not only on the proven accuracy (all three are highly accurate) but also on the availability of the techniques and on the experience and conﬁdence of the physician performing and interpreting the technique. CT has become the most commonly used ﬁrst-time imaging modality partly because it is more readily available on a 24-hour basis.129 TEE may be the preferred imaging modality in the emergency room, if an experienced cardiologist is available, because it provides immediate and sufﬁcient information to determine if emergency surgery will be required. Although CT may be less accurate for determining the degree and mechanism of AR, this can be evaluated by TTE and/or intraoperative TEE. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the various imaging modalities are summarized in Table 9.
There are situations in which a single imaging test is insufﬁcient to conﬁdently conﬁrm or exclude the diagnosis of aortic dissection. A strong clinical suspicion accompanied by a negative initial imaging test should dictate a second test, as should a situation in which the ﬁrst test is nondiagnostic. This may be due to technical limitations or interpretative difﬁculties (e.g., distinguishing an artifact from a true ﬂap). Because of the importance of establishing a correct diagnosis in this potentially life-threatening condition, obtaining a second or even a third imaging modality should be considered.
In summary, CT is an excellent imaging modality for diagnosing aortic dissection and is most often the initial modality when aortic dissection is suspected because of its accuracy, widespread availability, and because it provides rapid evaluation of the entire aorta and its branches. TTE may be useful as the initial imaging modality in the emergency room, especially when the aortic root is involved. Contrast may improve its accuracy. TTE may also complement CT by adding information about the presence, severity, and mechanism(s) of AR, pericardial effusion, and left ventricular function. TEE may be a second-line diagnostic procedure when information from CT is limited (sometimes not certain if the ascending aorta is involved). TEE can deﬁne entry tear location and size, mechanism(s) and severity of AR, and involvement of coronary arteries. TEE should be performed immediately before surgery in the operating room and should be used to monitor the operative results. All of these modalities may be helpful for identifying associated lesions at the aortic valve level (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve [BAV]) that may require a speciﬁc surgical strategy.
6. Use of TEE to Guide Surgery for Type A Aortic
Dissection. TEE should be performed in the operating room in all patients during repair of type A aortic dissection. Even if the diagnosis has been ‘‘established’’ with a preoperative imaging modality, conﬁrmation by intraoperative TEE before initiating cardiopulmonary bypass will minimize the possibility of a false-positive diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of aortic dissection has been conﬁrmed, the primary purpose of the intraoperative TEE is to detail the anatomy of the dissection and to better deﬁne its physiologic consequences. The origin and proximal extent of the dissection ﬂap and the dimensions of the aorta at the annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, and STJ are important

for determining whether to replace the ascending aorta alone or to also replace the root.
Up to 50% of type A aortic dissections are complicated by moderate or severe AR, and there are several mechanisms by which this may occur.193 Most commonly, aortic dilatation, be it acute or chronic, leads to aortic leaﬂet tethering that, in turn, results in incomplete aortic valve closure and secondary AR.194 When the dissection ﬂap extends proximally into the sinuses of Valsalva (i.e., below the level of the STJ), it can effectively detach one or more of the aortic valve commissures from the outer aortic wall; the aortic valve leaﬂets are then no longer

suspended from the STJ and therefore prolapse in diastole, causing signiﬁcant AR. Less commonly, the dissection process is extensive and results in a long, complex dissection ﬂap, a piece of which may itself prolapse through the aortic valve into the left ventricular outﬂow tract in diastole, preventing normal leaﬂet coaptation and causing AR.195 Remarkably, in some patients, the dissection causes prolapse of the aortic leaﬂets, which would otherwise produce severe AR, yet a lengthy piece of the dissection ﬂap falls back against the aortic valve in early diastole and essentially smothers the oriﬁce and prevents regurgitation. In such cases, Doppler may reveal only mild AR

despite signiﬁcant disruption of the aortic valve. Alternatively, a circumferential dissection of the ascending aorta can tear away and produce a tubular proximal dissection ﬂap that prolapses the aortic valve in diastole, essentially akin to ‘‘intussusception,’’ producing severe AR.196 These patients may not require repair or replacement of the aortic valve.
Some patients with aortic dissection have more than one of these anatomic processes occurring simultaneously. Fortunately, most of these anatomic causes of AR are correctable during surgery, so informing the surgeon in detail about the anatomic ﬁndings and mechanisms of AR may permit successful repair rather than replacement of the aortic valve. Type A aortic dissection can sometimes compromise ﬂow to one of the coronary arteries, the right coronary artery more often than the left. Although coronary involvement may be evident preoperatively with ischemic changes on electrocardiography, the process may be dynamic, so the echocardiographer should examine both coronary ostia to determine if they are compromised (Figure 37). Color Doppler is useful to document normal or disturbed or absent ﬂow in each coronary artery.
The emergent surgical treatment of type A dissection is limited to proximal aortic segments in the majority of patients. However, when the dissection extends into the abdominal aorta, patients are at risk for malperfusion, which occurs from either of two mechanisms: static obstruction occurs when the dissection ﬂap extends into a branch artery and limits antegrade arterial ﬂow, and dynamic obstruction occurs because of marked compression of the true lumen by a distended false lumen, resulting in impaired forward ﬂow through the true lumen to feed the otherwise patent branch arteries. Because TEE is usually unable to visualize the abdominal branch arteries themselves, the presence of static obstruction cannot be readily assessed. However, TEE can identify true luminal compression in the distal descending thoracic aorta and conﬁrm impaired systolic ﬂow by Doppler. Although such ﬁndings do not necessarily indicate clinical malperfusion, at the very least they represent the substrate for dynamic malperfusion, and it is therefore important to bring this to the attention of the surgeon.
On occasion, distension of the false lumen will compress the true lumen and produce malperfusion of organs or limbs.197 Usually, stan-

dard surgical repair of the ascending aorta restores ﬂow to the true lumen partially or fully. If the true lumen remains compressed and is associated with malperfusion, further intervention (e.g., endovascular stent grafting or percutaneous fenestration of the dissection ﬂap to decompress the false lumen) may be necessary.198 On occasion, in patients with organ malperfusion, endovascular stent grafts may be placed before repair of the ascending aorta.
Preoperative TEE should also evaluate the pericardial space for the presence of an associated pericardial effusion. In some cases, aortic dissection may be accompanied by a small serous effusion, but more often, the presence of an effusion is due to bleeding into the pericardial space. In such cases, the blood pooling acutely in the pericardial space will typically clot and appear echocardiographically as a mass sliding back and forth within a layer of pericardial ﬂuid. This ﬁnding of a clot within the pericardial ﬂuid heralds potential catastrophic aortic rupture and should therefore be communicated promptly to the surgeon.
After the repair of a type A aortic dissection, the echocardiographer should systematically reexamine the anatomic features of the aortic valve and proximal aorta to make sure that the surgical correction has been adequate (including exclusion of the entry tear and exclusion of all proximal communications) and that the aortic valve is competent. In addition, when the dissection has extended to the distal aorta, the echocardiographer should reexamine the descending thoracic aorta to determine the presence of adequate ﬂow through the true lumen.
7. Use of Imaging Procedures to Guide Endovascular
Therapy. The success of TEVAR is critically dependent on high-quality, accurate imaging before, during, and after stent-graft placement.199 Although invasive catheter-based angiography (Figure 14) is the method of ﬁrst choice for the guidance of aortic stent-graft placement,42 TEE offers deﬁnite advantages in the hands of an experienced examiner,59,60,62,200,201 TEE is particularly useful in the operating room and provides contributions at various phases of the procedure. In patients with type B aortic dissection, guidewire advancement and positioning can be guided by both ﬂuoroscopy and TEE. However, unlike ﬂuoroscopy, TEE can differentiate between true and false lumens and can conﬁrm correct guidewire placement in the true lumen and prevent misplacement of a catheter or wire before deploying any device. In atherosclerotic aneurysms, protruding aortic plaques at the

(B) An IMH lacks a dissection ﬂap and true and false lumens and instead appears as a thickened aortic wall, typically with crescentic thickening as in this diagram. Notice that the aortic lumen is preserved (remains round and smooth walled).

proximal neck may impede tight adhesion between the stent-graft and aortic wall, leading to dangerous proximal leaks. These plaques are easily detected by TEE and not by angiography or ﬂuoroscopy. Therefore, just before proximal stent-graft deployment, TEE is essential for selecting an aortic wall segment without protruding plaques and conﬁrming selection of the stent-graft diameter.59,60,62
Orientation and navigation as guided by TEE can be complemented by the use of IVUS (usually with 10-MHz transducers) over a guidewire, thereby conﬁrming or correcting navigation in the true lumen even at the level of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. In addition, intraprocedural IVUS may clarify the mechanism of branch vessel compromise when malperfusion is suspected (e.g., dynamic vs static obstruction of a branch vessel).125,126 Thrombus formation within the false lumen can also be visualized by spontaneous echo contrast, and IMH is easily depicted as crescent-shaped or circular wall thickening. Device sizing can be very challenging with aortic dissections because of the possibility of compromising the true lumen. After endovascular stent graft implantation, IVUS also enables dynamic evaluation of the success of the procedure.200,202-204
Angiography, TEE, and IVUS are used for evaluating the expansion of stent grafts, veriﬁcation of branch anastomosis and the beginning of false lumen thrombosis, and reevaluation of improved malperfusion. During a procedure, TEE may be superior for assessing retrograde type A dissection and can provide immediate information on left ventricular function. With the use of color Doppler, TEE is superior to angiography, and especially to IVUS, in the detection of endoleaks after stent graft implantation.59,62,125 In several studies, TEE provided decisive additional information to angiography and ﬂuoroscopy, leading to successful procedural changes in up to 40% to 50% of patients.59,60,62 After stent-graft deployment, color Doppler TEE is highly useful for detecting persistent leaks that can be promptly resolved by balloon dilatation or further stent-graft implantations.205 Most of these leaks are not visible on angiography. To maximize sensitivity for persistent leaks, reduced Doppler scale (25 cm/sec) can improve color signal detection. However, by itself, this can lead to false-positive diagnoses of leaks, because immediately after implantation, Dacron porosity can create temporary low blood ﬂow through the stent (and seen with low-velocity color ﬂow Doppler), especially when systolic blood pressure is >120 mm Hg. To prevent false-positive diagnosis of leaks, pulsed Doppler velocity assessment permits distinction between Dacron porosity (usually with velocity <50 cm/sec) and the faster ﬂow of true persistent leaks

(usually >100 cm/sec) with higher sensitivity than angiography.126 In aortic dissection, TEE is also useful for detecting small distal reentry tears not visible on angiography; thoracic reentry tears can subsequently be resolved by additional stent-graft deployment.59,62,125 TEE is partially limited for visualizing the brachiocephalic and left common carotid artery ostia, and this information may be crucial to proximal positioning of the stent graft. It should be noted that TEE is useful when a Dacron stent graft is used, whereas it is not useful with polytetraﬂuoroethylene or Gore-Tex prostheses because polytetraﬂuoroethylene acts as a barrier to ultrasound.
In a recent small study, intraluminal phased-array ultrasound imaging proved to be superior to IVUS and to TEE in detecting communications between the true and false lumens of aortic dissection.200 However, IVUS and intraluminal phased-array ultrasound imaging catheters are disposable and therefore more expensive than TEE and cannot be performed simultaneously with stent-graft placement, whereas TEE is suited to parallel imaging and intraprocedural monitoring.
In summary, TEE and IVUS are particularly useful for guiding endovascular procedures requiring hybrid monitoring techniques, such as a combination of stent-graft placement and open visceral bypass grafting.59,62,206 TEE is crucial for selecting and monitoring surgical treatment and detecting complications that may require intervention. Thus, intraoperative TEE should be considered mandatory. TEE may also be useful during endovascular procedures in patients with descending aortic dissections by differentiating true and false lumens, permitting correct guidewire placement in the true lumen, helping guide correct stent-graft positioning, and identifying suboptimal results and presence of leaks.
8. Serial Follow-Up of Aortic Dissection (Choice of
Tests). After the diagnosis and management of acute aortic dissection, imaging techniques play a major role in prognosis assessment and in the diagnosis of complications during follow-up. Morphologic and dynamic information may be useful for predicting aortic dissection evolution and identifying the subgroup of patients with a greater tendency to severe aortic enlargement. Regular assessment of the aorta should be made 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the acute event, followed by yearly examinations.
After discharge, variables related to greater aortic dilatation were entry tear size, maximum descending aorta diameter in the subacute phase, and the high-pressure pattern in false lumen. Maximum aortic

diameter in the subacute phase was a signiﬁcant predictor of progressive dilatation because, according to the law of Laplace, larger aortic diameters are associated with increased wall stress.
TEE provides prognostic information in acute type A dissection beyond that provided by clinical risk variables. A ﬂap conﬁned to ascending aorta or a completely thrombosed false lumen has proved to have a protective role.207 Finally, increased false luminal pressure is another important factor predictive of future false luminal enlargement. In the majority of cases, high false luminal pressure relates to a large entry tear without distal emptying ﬂow or reentry site of similar size. It may be difﬁcult to identify the distal reentry communication; thus, in the presence of a large entry tear, indirect signs of high false luminal pressure such as true luminal compression, partial false luminal thrombosis, or the velocity pattern of the echocardiographic contrast in the false lumen should be considered.
CT is the technique most frequently used for serial follow-up of aortic dissection. The large ﬁeld of view of CT permits identiﬁcation of anatomic landmarks that allow measurements to be obtained at identical levels as previous measurements. CT has excellent reproducibility for aortic size measurement, has excellent accuracy for identifying entry tears and distal reentry sites, and allows the assessment of vessel malperfusion. MRI appears to be an excellent alternative technique for following patients treated medically or surgically in AAS. MRI avoids exposure to ionizing radiation and the nephrotoxic contrast agents used for computed tomographic angiography and is less invasive than TEE. Furthermore, the integrated study of anatomy and physiology of blood ﬂow can provide information that may explain the mechanism(s) responsible for aortic dilatation. Time-resolved MRA can provide additional dynamic information on blood ﬂow in entry tears. Velocity-encoded cine MR sequences have a promising role in the functional assessment of aortic dissection by virtue of quantiﬁcation of ﬂow in both lumens and the possibility of identifying hemodynamic patterns of progressive dilatation risk. For planning surgery or endovascular repair, it is very useful to demonstrate the course of the ﬂap, entry tear location, false luminal thrombosis, aortic diameter, and main arterial trunk involvement. Both computed tomographic angiography and MRA take advantage of postprocessing software capabilities that allow multiplane reconstructions, maximum-intensity projection (MIP) and volume-rendering reconstructions.
9. Predictors of Complications by Imaging Techniques. a.
Maximum Aortic Diameter.–Maximum aortic dilatation after the acute phase is a major predictor of complications during follow-up. Both CT and MRI are superior to TEE for measuring the aortic size distal to the aortic root. Aneurysmal dilatation of the dissected aorta will occur in 25% to 40% of patients surviving acute type B aortic dissection. Secondary dilatation of the aorta during follow-up of aortic dissection has been considered a signiﬁcant predictor of aortic rupture. A descending thoracic aortic diameter > 45 mm after the acute phase and the presence of a patent false lumen have been related to aneurysm development of the false lumen (>60 mm)

Figure 39 Transesophageal echocardiogram of a crosssectional view of the descending thoracic aorta at 35 cm from the incisors illustrates a crescentic-shaped IMH.

and surgical reintervention. A diameter > 60 mm or annual growth > 5 mm implies a high risk for aortic rupture.208 Other studies have shown maximum false luminal diameter in the proximal part of descending aorta to be a predictor of complications.209 However, this diameter has low reproducibility, mainly due to movement of the intimal ﬂap. b. Patent False Lumen.–In addition to aortic diameter, a consistent predictor of outcomes in acute type B aortic dissection has been the hemodynamic status of the false lumen, classically divided into either a thrombosed false lumen or a patent false lumen. Persistence of patent false lumen in the descending aorta is common in both dissection types and has been strongly associated with poor prognosis. Total thrombosis of the false lumen, considered a precursor of spontaneous healing, is a rare event, even after surgical repair of a type A aortic dissection. A persistently patent false lumen can be found in most type B aortic dissections during follow-up and in >70% of type A

aortic dissections after surgical repair.197 After type A dissection repair, patent false lumen in the descending aorta is linked to survival at 5 years. Thus, use of intraoperative TEE to direct elimination of the entry tear, not just repairing the ascending aorta, is of great importance.
c. Partial False Luminal Thrombosis.–Studies have shown that completely thrombosed false lumens have improved outcomes, whereas patent false lumens carry an increased risk for aortic expansion and death.197,210 However, in the IRAD series, partial thrombosis of the false lumen, deﬁned as the concurrent presence of both ﬂow and thrombus and present in a third of patients, was the strongest independent predictor of follow-up mortality, with a 2.7-fold increased risk for death compared to patients with patent false lumen without thrombus formation.199 Prospective studies using CT or MR for assessing the whole aorta are required to conﬁrm these results.
d. Entry Tear Size.–The prognostic value of entry tear size was evaluated by Evangelista et al.,211 who documented that a large entry tear is a strong predictor of late mortality and of the need for aortic surgical treatment. An entry tear size $ 10 mm was an optimal cutoff value for predicting dissection-related adverse events, with sensitivity of 85% and speciﬁcity of 87%. TEE and CT are superior to MRI in the assessment of entry tear size and location. Recently it has been shown that agreement between entry tear area by 3D TEE and CT is excellent.151 When the entry tear is small, the ﬂow volume that enters the false lumen is low, and thus the false luminal pressures will be low. Therefore, the combination of a large entry tear and indirect signs of high pressure of the false lumen, distinguishable by imaging techniques, should be considered a predictor of aortic enlargement and adverse events and warrants close follow-up.
e. True Luminal Compression.–True luminal compression is an indirect sign of high false luminal pressure. However, true luminal compression assessment may be limited by intimal ﬂap movement during the cardiac cycle, as well as local factors such as in spiral dissection, that may reduce reproducibility of this ﬁnding. Patients with clear overall true luminal compression have a higher risk for rapid false luminal enlargement and further aortic complications.
10. Follow-Up Strategy. After discharge, follow-up by CT or MRI is indicated depending on technique availability, preferential information sought, and patient characteristics such as age, renal function, and test tolerance at 3, 6, 12 months and annually thereafter.

C. IMH
1. Introduction. Advances in aortic imaging technology, including TEE, CT, and MRI, have led to increasing recognition of aortic IMH among patients with AAS. IMH, generally considered to be a variant of aortic dissection, accounts for approximately 10% to 25% of AAS (Table 10). IMH was ﬁrst described in 1920 as ‘‘dissection without intimal tear’’212 and was believed to result from rupture of the vasa vasorum, allowing bleeding between the elastic lamina of the aortic media.79,212,213 However, recent ﬁndings suggest that at least some IMHs may be initiated by small intimal tears that are undetectable by current aortic imaging modalities and are often overlooked on gross inspection of the aorta at the time of surgery or autopsy.214-217 IMH is not a single entity but can be associated with several conditions, including spontaneous (‘‘typical’’) aortic dissection, penetrating ulcer, aortic trauma, and iatrogenic dissection (cardiac catheterization, cardiac surgery).
2. Imaging Hallmarks and Features. The imaging hallmarks of classic aortic dissection—the presence of a dissection ﬂap and the presence of a double channel aorta—are both absent in IMH (Figure 38) In addition, there is usually no reentry site. General imaging features of IMH are listed in Table 11. Typically, IMH appears as thickening of the

The aortic lumen’s shape is preserved, and the luminal wall is curvilinear and usually smooth, as opposed to a rough, irregular border seen with aortic atherosclerosis and penetrating ulcer, although both may coexist. There is no Doppler evidence of communication between the hematoma and the true lumen, but there may be some color Doppler ﬂow within the hematoma. There may also be areas of echolucency within the aortic wall hematoma. IMH is generally a more localized process than classic aortic dissection, which typically propagates along the entire aorta to the iliac arteries. IMH may weaken the aortic wall and either progress outward with aortic expansion and/or rupture or inward with disruption of the intima-media, resulting in typical aortic dissection. Evangelista et al. described seven evolution patterns: regression, progression to classical dissection with longitudinal propagation, progression to localized dissection, development of fusiform aneurysm, development of saccular aneurysm, development of pseudoaneurysm, and persistence of IMH. Therefore, serial imaging is necessary to rule out progression in patients who receive only medical treatment, because clinical signs and symptoms cannot predict progression. Although there are no established guidelines for the optimal frequency and longitudinal duration for surveillance imaging of patients with IMH, Evangelista et al.,154 on the basis of the signiﬁcant dynamic evolution of IMH, recommended imaging at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the time of diagnosis. Once stability has been documented, surveillance imaging may be annual.
IMHs present a more difﬁcult diagnostic challenge than typical aortic dissections because of the lack of both ﬂow and an oscillating dissection ﬂap. Because IMH thickness may be progressive, establishing the diagnosis of IMH may require observation time and repeat imaging. Evangelista et al.218 demonstrated that the initial imaging test results were negative in >12% of patients and that a repeat study was required hours to several days later. IMH can be difﬁcult to distinguish from a thrombosed false lumen of classic aortic dissection, because they can both appear as a crescent-shaped thickening of the aortic wall. However, in aortic dissection, the diameter of the thrombosed false lumen is usually larger than that of most, but not all, IMHs. Conversely, the circumferential extent of an IMH is usually larger than that of an aortic dissection. The appearance of a crescentshaped thickening of the aortic wall can be mimicked by a normal structure, the hemiazygos sheath, which is a periaortic fat pad.219 This fat pad is typically present on TEE when the tip of the probe is 30 to 35 cm from the incisors. Aortic atherosclerosis results in thickening of the aortic wall but produces an irregular intraluminal surface that differentiates it from IMH, which has a smooth luminal surface. Moreover, the ‘‘lumpy-bumpy’’ appearance of atherosclerosis tends to vary along each centimeter of the aorta, unlike IMH, which tends to be smooth over a greater length of the aorta. Mural thrombus

may appear lining a TAA, most often in the descending aorta, but typically has an irregular luminal surface, narrows the lumen and does not extend longitudinally as much as IMH. Figure 41 illustrates the different features of several of these entities from IMH. Aortitis causes thickening of the aortic wall that is typically concentric and typically has normal segments interspersed between the involved sites.
Detection of IMH by CT shows thickening of the aortic wall with higher attenuation than intraluminal blood (from 40 to 70 Hounsﬁeld units) on contrast-enhanced CT (Figure 42). It is vitally important to perform unenhanced CT as the ﬁrst step in the computed tomographic imaging evaluation of a suspected AAS, because contrast material within the lumen may obscure the IMH. On imaging follow-up of IMH, the appearance of ulcerlike projections (ULPs) is frequently observed, likely representing intimal ruptures that allow communication between the aortic lumen and the medial wall hematoma.220 MRI offers the possibility of diagnosing intramural bleeding in the hyperacute phase because the hematoma shows an isointense signal on T1-weighted images and a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images. From the ﬁrst 24 hours, the change from oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin determines a hyperintense signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images that together with fat suppression is useful for differentiating periaortic fat from IMH. Although greater availability and shorter examination duration favor the use of

exudate believed to be inﬂammatory in origin owing to the proximity of the IMH to the adventitia.210,230 The likely different prognostic signiﬁcance of the two pathogenic theories proposed may explain the discordance in the medical literature.
Key points related to IMH are listed in Table 12.

CT in the acute setting, MRI may be complementary for the diagnosis of IMH. The greater contrast among tissues can allow MRI to detect even small IMHs that may go unnoticed by CT. In addition, mural thrombi in TAAs are easier to distinguish from IMH by MRI because mural thrombus shows a hypo- or isointense signal in both T1- and T2-weighted sequences.
3. Imaging Algorithm. CT may be considered the ﬁrst-line diagnostic imaging modality for IMH, particularly in the acute setting. Detection is based on the high-attenuation signal of acute bleeding by noncontrast enhancement. When ﬁndings on CTor TEE are equivocal, MRI may be valuable, as the hyperintense signal in the aortic wall can facilitate a correct diagnosis.
4. Serial Follow-Up of IMH (Choice of Tests). As above, IMH may evolve by reabsorption, aneurysm formation, or conversion to classic dissection.154 In one series, IMH regressed completely in 34%, led to aneurysm in 20% and pseudoaneurysm in 24%, and progressed to aortic dissection in 12%. Because of their wide ﬁeld of vision allowing the identiﬁcation of landmarks, MRI and CT are superior to TEE for deﬁning this dynamic evolution. On surveillance imaging of IMH, the appearance of ULP is frequently observed, and such ulcers may rupture and allow communication between the medial hematoma and the aortic lumen.221,222 MRI offers the possibility of diagnosing the intramural bleeding evolution and new asymptomatic intramural rebleeding episodes.
5. Predictors of Complications. Most of these predictors may be deﬁned by imaging techniques:
1. Maximum aortic diameter in the acute phase is one of the major predictors of progression in type B IMH and therefore should be reported. Patients with maximum aortic diameters > 40 to 50 mm have a higher risk for dissection, regardless of the location within the descending aorta.216,223-229
2. Wall thickness has been described as a predictor of progression; however, not all studies have supported this ﬁnding. The thickness threshold for predicting progression has been variably reported to be 10, 12, or 15 mm.228
3. The incidence of periaortic hemorrhage or pleural effusion is higher in IMH than in aortic dissection; in some studies, this incidence reaches to 40%. Some series related pleural effusion to worse prognosis in IMH; however, this remains controversial. Two mechanisms have been described: leakage of blood from the aorta through microperforations or a nonhemorrhagic

D. PAU
1. Introduction. The term penetrating aortic ulcer describes the condition in which ulceration of an atherosclerotic lesion penetrates the aortic internal elastic lamina into the aortic media (Figure 43).231 Although the clinical presentation of PAU is similar to that of classic aortic dissection, PAU is considered to be a disease of the intima (i.e., atherosclerosis), whereas aortic dissection and its variant (IMH) are fundamentally diseases of the media (degenerative changes of the elastic ﬁbers and smooth muscle cells are paramount), and most patients with aortic dissection typically have little atherosclerotic disease. PAUs may occur anywhere along the length of the aorta but appear most often in the mid and distal portions of the descending thoracic aorta, and they are uncommon in the ascending aorta, arch, and abdominal aorta.232 PAUs are sometimes multifocal, which is to be expected because aortic atherosclerosis is a diffuse process. They may occur in an aorta of normal caliber but are more often present in aortas of increased diameter.232-235
Typically, when an ulcer penetrates into the media, a localized IMH develops (Figure 44). In most patients, this IMH is localized, but occasionally it can involve the entire descending aorta.223 Rarely, the medial hematoma ruptures back into the aortic lumen, resulting in a classic-appearing dissection with ﬂow in both lumens. Once formed, PAUs may remain quiescent, but the weakened aortic wall may provide a basis for saccular, fusiform, or false aneurysm formation.231,233,224-227 External rupture into the mediastinum or right or left pleural space may occur but is uncommon.233,234 Embolization of thrombus or atherosclerotic debris from the ulcer to the distal arterial circulation may also occur.
2. Imaging Features. The diagnosis of PAU requires demonstration of an ‘‘ulcerlike’’ or ‘‘craterlike’’ out-pouching in the aortic wall (the internal elastic lamina is not visible on imaging studies), as seen in Figure 45. Because protrusion through the internal elastic lamina cannot be identiﬁed, PAUs can be detected only when they protrude outside the contour of the aortic lumen. Atheromatous ulcers that do not enter the media may be hard to distinguish from PAUs. Therefore, a diagnosis of PAU must be made with caution, especially if the suspected aortic defect has been detected incidentally.
Another entity that may be mistaken for a PAU is a ULP that may evolve from an IMH, as described above. These are localized,

blood-ﬁlled pouches that protrude into the IMH, with a wide communicating oriﬁce of >3 mm. ULPs are felt to be the consequence of a focal dissection and a short intimal ﬂap resulting in a small pseudoaneurysm. Differentiation from a PAU may be difﬁcult. Generally, a PAU has jagged edges, is accompanied by multiple irregularities in the intimal layer, and may be accompanied by localized hematoma.
TEE, CT, and MRI may all detect PAU and its complications. Once identiﬁed, attention should be directed to assessing (1) the maximum depth of penetration of the ulcer, measured from the aortic lumen; (2) its maximum width at the entry site; and (3) the axial length of the associated medial hematoma. Observations that should be reported are listed in Table 13.
3. Imaging Modalities. a. CT.–The typical computed tomographic ﬁnding of a PAU is a localized contrastlike out-pouching of the aortic wall communicating with the lumen. Its appearance has been likened to a ‘‘collar button.’’228 As mentioned above, PAUs are most often found in the mid or distal descending thoracic aorta.226 Thickening (enhancement) of the aortic wall external to sites of intimal calciﬁcation suggests localized IMH. These ﬁndings are usually in conjunction with severe atherosclerosis. CT has certain advantages over TEE. It can examine areas of the aorta not covered by TEE, allowing more complete identiﬁcation of the out-pouching produced by PAUs. Moreover, it can also identify calciﬁed atherosclerotic plaques surrounding the ulcer. Computed tomographic angiography is also more likely than TEE to demonstrate extraluminal abnormalities, including pseudoaneurysm or ﬂuid in the mediastinum or pleural space.

Figure 46 Diagram illustrating the two morphologic types of aortic aneurysms: saccular and fusiform.
b. MRI.–MRI is excellent for detecting focal or extensive IMHs, which appear as areas of high signal intensity within the aortic wall on T1-weighted images.79,229 Yucel et al.236 demonstrated that MRI is superior to conventional CT for differentiating acute IMH from atherosclerotic plaque and chronic intraluminal thrombus. MRI has the additional advantage of providing multiplane images without the use of contrast material.
c. TEE.–TEE has been less well studied than CT and MRI for the diagnosis of PAU but may be of value when the results of CT and MRI are inconclusive. The characteristic ﬁnding, similar to what is seen on CT and MRI, is a craterlike out-pouching of the aortic wall, often with jagged edges, usually associated with extensive aortic atheroma. Although uncommon, a localized aortic dissection may occur, but the dissection ﬂap, if present, tends to be thick, irregular, nonoscillating, and usually of limited length.237 The reason for the limited length of the dissection may be that the dissection plane is lost because of scarring or atrophy of the media and secondary to the atherosclerotic process.
d. Aortography.–Catheter-based aortography is rarely performed to diagnose PAU because of the superiority of current axial imaging modalities and the high deﬁnition of TEE. These modalities also

provide superior deﬁnition of the surrounding wall, making identiﬁcation of associated IMH easier. The characteristic aortography ﬁnding, a contrast medium–ﬁlled out-pouching resembling an ulcer of the gastrointestinal tract, is typically associated with ‘‘cobblestoning’’ of the aortic wall in the region of the ulcer consistent with diffuse atherosclerosis, in the absence of a dissection ﬂap or false lumen.
4. Imaging Algorithm. CTA is considered the ﬁrst-line diagnostic imaging modality.226,234,238-240 It is widely available, permits assessment of other thoracic structures, and provides 3D reconstructed images that are essential in planning surgery or TEVAR. Moreover, CT is superior to TEE for detecting small ulcers. It is also efﬁcient for the evaluation of the degree of ulcer penetration and bleeding into or outside the aortic wall. MRI is excellent for differentiating PAUs from IMH, atherosclerotic plaque, and intraluminal chronic mural thrombus.241,242 However, MRI is less widely available than CT and is unable to detect displacement of intimal calciﬁcation, which frequently accompanies PAU. Recommendations for choice of imaging modalities for PAUs are summarized in Table 14.
Despite differences in opinion regarding the natural history and management of PAUs, there is agreement that all PAUs, even those found incidentally, warrant close clinical and imaging follow-up, usually by CTA. Findings concerning for progression include an increase in aortic diameter or wall thickening or the appearance of a thinwalled saccular aneurysm. Rupture is indicated by the presence of extra-aortic blood.
5. Serial Follow-Up of PAU (Choice of Tests). The natural history of PAU is unknown. As with IMH, several outcomes have been described. Many patients with PAUs do not need immediate aortic repair but do require close follow-up with serial imaging studies, by CT or MRI, to document disease progression. Although many authors have documented the propensity for aortic ulcers to develop progressive aneurysmal dilatation, the progression is usually slow. Spontaneous complete aortic rupture is uncommon but may occur. Some PAUs are found incidentally, in which case size and progressive enlargement are the only predictors of complications. Both CT and MRI provide superior assessment to TEE in the follow-up of PAU. Surveillance imaging should be performed at intervals similar to what is recommended for aortic dissection.

IV. THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSM
A. Deﬁnitions and Terminology
Aortic aneurysm is a pathologic entity that is distinct from aortic dissection. The vast majority of aortic dissections (longitudinal splitting of the media) occur without preceding aneurysms. True aneurysms result from stretching of the entire thickness of the aortic wall; thus, the wall of an aneurysm contains all three of its layers (intima, media, and adventitia). TAAs may involve one or more aortic segments (the aortic root, ascending aorta, arch, or descending thoracic aorta). Sixty percent of TAAs involve the aortic root and/or ascending tubular aorta, 40% involve the descending aorta, 10% involve the arch, and 10% involve the thoracoabdominal aorta.243 In 1991, the joint councils of the Society of Vascular Surgery and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery appointed an ad hoc committee to deﬁne the standards for reporting on arterial aneurysm.244 Aneurysm was deﬁned as a permanent focal dilatation of an artery having a $50% increase in diameter compared with the expected normal diameter of the artery in question. This deﬁnition was also adopted by the 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation, American Heart Association, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American College of Radiology, American Surgical Association, Society for Cardiac Angiography and Interventions, Society of Interventional Radiology, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Society for Vascular Medicine guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease.1

Although our writing committee endorses this deﬁnition in general, we would like to point out some practical considerations. First, the current deﬁnition lacks an outcomes correlate; second, many publications use the term aortic dilatation with different arbitrary cutoff values to deﬁne the signiﬁcance of dilatation.245-248 Last, if a common echocardiographic upper limit of 37 mm is considered for the ascending aorta (see the section on normal anatomy and reference values), then the ascending aorta is dilated at a diameter of >55.5 mm (37 + 18.5 mm), which seems excessive given that it is larger than the typical threshold for surgery. General descriptions, such as ‘‘there is an ascending aortic aneurysm,’’ are inadequate.243 It is preferable to state that ‘‘there is a 5-cm ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm,’’ because it conveys prognostic, follow-up, and management implications. Descriptive terms such as small, large, and giant to describe aneurysms should also be avoided.
Other commonly used terms are included in the 2010 guidelines1: ectasia is arterial dilatation < 150% of normal arterial diameter. Arteriomegaly is diffuse arterial dilatation involving several arterial segments, with an increase in diameter > 50% in comparison with the expected normal arterial diameter.
Aortic dilatation is an acceptable nonspeciﬁc term that encompasses both ectasia and aneurysm. Again, imaging reports must include the diameters of the affected aortic segments. Moreover, it is ideal to perform serial imaging studies at the same center with the same technique, so that direct comparisons can be made.243 When this is not practical, direct comparison with previous examinations should be made to conﬁrm that serial changes are genuine.

B. Classiﬁcation of Aneurysms Aortic aneurysms can be classiﬁed according to morphology, location (as above), and etiology. The etiologies of TAAs are listed in Table 15. These are discussed in other sections of this document.
C. Morphology Aneurysms of the aorta can be classiﬁed into two morphologic types: fusiform and saccular (Figure 46). Fusiform aneurysms, which are more common than saccular aneurysms, result from diffuse weakening of the aortic wall. This process leads to dilatation of the entire circumference of the aorta, producing a spindle-shaped deformity with a tapered beginning and end. Saccular aneurysms result when only a portion of the aortic circumference is weakened, producing an asymmetric, relatively focal balloon-shaped out-pouching. There are also various morphologic shapes of the aortic root and ascending aorta, some of which suggest speciﬁc etiologies (Figure 47).
The major goals of imaging TAAs are listed in Table 16, and recommendations for choice of imaging modalities are listed in Table 17.
D. Serial Follow-Up of Aortic Aneurysms (Choice of Tests) Aortic diameter is the principal predictor of aortic rupture or dissection.249 The risk for rupture or dissection of TAAs from different etiologies increases signiﬁcantly at sizes > 60 mm. The mean rupture rate is only 2% per year for aneurysms <50 mm in diameter, rising slightly to 3% for aneurysms with diameters of 50 to 59 mm, but increasing sharply to 7% per year for aneurysms $60 mm in

diameter.250 The rate of growth is signiﬁcantly greater for aneurysms of the descending aorta, at 1.9 mm per year, than those of the ascending aorta, at 0.07 mm per year.249
The clinical importance of the maximum aortic diameter for determining the timing of prophylactic surgical repair implies makes it critical that measurements be made as accurately as possible. It is essential for the same observer to compare measurements side by side using the same anatomic references. Tomographic scans in a situation for which the aorta does not lie perpendicular to the plane of the scan produce an elliptical image with major (maximum) and minor (minimum) diameters. Because the major diameter is typically an overestimate, in most natural history studies of aneurysm expansion, the minimum diameter has been reported to avoid the effect of obliquity.
Aortic root dilatation can be followed by TTE in most cases. Diameter expansion, severity of AR, and left ventricular function may be accurately evaluated when the echocardiographic window is adequate. However, when dilatation involves the ascending aorta above the STJ, TTE does not always adequately visualize the affected segment, in which case CTor MRI should be performed. TEE may be warranted when the type of surgical treatment (repair or valve replacement) is being considered. Both TTE and TEE have limitations for adequate measurement of distal ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta diameters. In addition, if the aorta is tortuous, transesophageal echocardiographic images may be difﬁcult to measure accurately. The multiplanar capacity of MDCT, together with its submillimeter spatial resolution, renders it an excellent technique for interval surveillance of both thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Measurements must adhere to a strict protocol that permits comparison between different imaging techniques as well as follow-up of the patient. MDCT permits one to choose an imaging plane in any arbitrary space orientation; thus, it is possible to easily ﬁnd the maximum aortic diameter plane, which must be perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of the aortic segment. When the axial data are reconstructed into 3D images (computed tomographic angiography), one can measure the tortuous aorta in true cross-section and obtain an accurate diameter. Measurements should be taken on multiplane reconstruction images. A further common presentation of data is a parasagittal, oblique MIP plane that passes through the aortic root, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta. The MIP plane must have a thickness proportional to the aortic tortuosity to make sure that the maximum diameter is included in the image. This plane is easily reproducible and comparable in follow-up studies.
MRI accurately deﬁnes aortic diameter, aneurysm extent, and the aneurysm’s relationship with the main arterial branches. It is recommended to combine MR angiographic images with black-blood spinecho sequences, which are useful for detecting pathology of the wall and adjacent structures that could go unnoticed if only MR angiographic images are acquired. In mycotic aneurysm, postcontrast T1weighted images permit the identiﬁcation of inﬂammatory changes in the aortic wall and adjacent fat, secondary to bacterial infection. The information provided by MRA in aortic aneurysm assessment is similar to that offered by current MDCT. Both methods permit accurate determinations of aortic diameters in sagittal plane. Furthermore, postprocessing techniques (MIP, multiplane reconstruction, and volume rendering) facilitate visualization of the aorta in its entirety, together with the relationship of its principal branches, and are highly useful when planning treatment. The sagittal plane makes it possible to obtain more reproducible measurements. In asymptomatic patients with aortic aneurysms and those approaching the need for surgery, imaging techniques should be performed at 6-month intervals until aortic size remains stable, in which case imaging may be annual.

1. Algorithm for Follow-Up. TTE can be used for serial imaging of the dilated aortic root and proximal ascending aorta when agreement between the dimensions measured by TTE and CT or MRI has been established. When the aneurysm is located in the mid or upper portion of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, or descending thoracic aorta, CT or MRI is recommended for follow-up. Measurements should be made on multiplane reconstruction images or in parasagittal, oblique MIP plane that passes through the involved aortic segments. Although annual surveillance MDCT has been recommended, the strategy is not well established and should be individualized from annually to every 2 to 3 years depending on the abnormalities present, history of complications among family members, the present size, and the degree of change in size over time.
E. Use of TEE to Guide Surgery for TAAs
When patients with aortic root or ascending TAAs undergo aortic repair, the anatomy of the aorta and aortic valve has usually been deﬁned preoperatively. Nevertheless, it is always wise to use intraoperative TEE to conﬁrm the prior imaging ﬁndings. The initial intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic examination should begin before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, so the physiology of the aortic valve can be assessed. If the valve is bicuspid, one should determine the presence and severity of associated valvular aortic stenosis, regurgitation, or both. If there is signiﬁcant AR, one should determine the mechanism, looking speciﬁcally for prolapse and/or retraction of the conjoined leaﬂet, as this is a common cause of bicuspid AR and may be correctable with BAV repair. One should also assess the degree of leaﬂet thickening, calciﬁcation, and restriction, because in the setting of signiﬁcant valve dysfunction, these ﬁndings may inﬂuence the surgeon’s decision regarding the need for valve repair or replacement.
Even when the aortic valve is tricuspid with otherwise normal leaflets, the presence of an ascending aortic aneurysm can result in AR. The commissures of the aortic leaﬂets are located just below the STJ; dilatation of the aorta at that level may tether the leaﬂets, leaving insufﬁcient slack for the three leaﬂets to coapt properly in the middle, resulting in a jet of central AR.32,194,251 AR due to leaﬂet tethering can occur with aneurysms of both the aortic root and the ascending aorta. Fortunately, with repair of the aneurysm and restoration of normal aortic geometry, normal leaﬂet coaptation is often restored, which in turn leads to resolution of the valvular regurgitation. Therefore, in a patient with an aneurysm with signiﬁcant AR, identifying such aortic leaﬂet tethering on preoperative TEE may reassure the surgeon that aortic valve replacement is not necessary.
The ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta should each be inspected for the presence of associated pathology, such as an unrecognized aortic dissection, IMH, PAU, or protruding atheromas. Large atheromas in the ascending aorta or arch may prompt additional imaging of the aorta using intraoperative epiaortic echocardiography and inﬂuence decisions regarding the site of aortic cannulation and perfusion.
Postoperative TEE should begin as soon as the patient comes off cardiopulmonary bypass. The examination should begin with inspection of the aortic valve, as unanticipated valve dysfunction may necessitate a return to bypass. If preoperatively there had been signiﬁcant AR due to leaﬂet tethering, one should conﬁrm appropriate leaﬂet coaptation and alleviation of AR after repair. If repair of bicuspid valve prolapse was performed, one should conﬁrm that the prolapse has resolved and that the AR is no longer signiﬁcant. If a valve-sparing root repair was performed, one should conﬁrm that the three aortic valve leaﬂets coapt normally and that there is little or no AR. If the

aortic valve had been replaced, one should conﬁrm that the prosthetic leaﬂet or disk motion is normal, that there is no more than physiologic AR, and that there are no paravalvular leaks.
After aortic valve replacement or aortic root replacement, it is typical to see focal thickening around the aortic root. It is important to document this so as not to confuse this ﬁnding with pathology on subsequent imaging. For more detailed information, readers are referred to the recently published Society of Thoracic Surgeons aortic valve and ascending aorta guidelines for management and quality measures.252
F. Speciﬁc Conditions
1. Marfan Syndrome. Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder of connective tissue that occurs as a result of a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which encodes ﬁbrillin. One of the hallmark features of this disorder is dilatation or dissection of the proximal ascending aorta (aortic root).253 The remaining portions of the aorta may also dilate and dissect, but involvement of the aortic root is expected when there is associated vascular disease. Noninvasive aortic imaging with subsequent elective aortic replacement has contributed to the dramatic improvement in survival noted in patients with Marfan syndrome over the past few decades.254
a. Aortic Imaging in Unoperated Patients with Marfan Syndrome.–TTE is generally the initial imaging tool used for the identiﬁcation and serial follow-up of ascending aortic enlargement in patients with known or suspected Marfan syndrome, because of its availability, noninvasive nature, reliability, and lack of need for radiation or contrast material. Characteristic aortic features include dilatation of the aortic root, whereas the STJ and remaining portions of the ascending aorta generally are normal in size (Figure 48). Normative values are used to determine the presence and extent of aortic enlargement on the basis of age and BSA.9 The leading edge–to–leading edge measurement technique is generally performed in patients with Marfan syndrome <18 years of age, and the size of the aorta is reported along with the Z score.255 Although there is dispute regarding the best echocardiographic aortic measurement method, the most important concept is that serial measurements for each individual patient are performed using the same method to determine aortic dimension change over time.

Some patients with Marfan syndrome have suboptimal transthoracic echocardiographic images, and in these patients, serial CT or MRI is required to monitor aortic diameter.
At the time of initial diagnosis of aortopathy in Marfan syndrome by TTE, additional imaging with CT or MRI is generally recommended to conﬁrm that the size of the aorta measured by TTE is accurate and correlates with the computed tomographic or MRI measurement and to document the diameters of the distal ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aortic segments, which may also be enlarged but are often incompletely visualized by TTE (Figure 49).
For the follow-up of aortic root enlargement in patients with Marfan syndrome, follow-up imaging in 6 months is recommended. If at that time the aortic diameter remains stable, is <45 mm, and there is no family or personal history of aortic dissection, then annual aortic imaging is reasonable. Patients with Marfan syndrome who do not meet these criteria should undergo repeat aortic imaging every 6 months.
TTE can be used for serial imaging follow-up of the dilated ascending aorta when correlation between the dimensions measured by TTE and CT or MRI has been documented. Occasionally, patients with Marfan syndrome do not demonstrate aortic enlargement until well into adulthood. These patients can be referred for transthoracic echocardiographic screening at 2- to 3-year intervals.
Repeat CT or MRI is suggested at least every 3 years in patients with Marfan syndrome to reassess the aortic arch and descending

aorta and to reconﬁrm that TTE remains reliable in its measurement of the ascending aorta. Patients with Marfan syndrome with aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal descending thoracic aorta require regular CT or MRI to monitor aortic stability, because TTE does not provide reliable imaging of this region.
TEE is generally not used for the initial diagnosis or follow-up of aortic dilatation in patients with Marfan syndrome because of its semi-invasive nature and the difﬁculty directly comparing dimensions over time.
b. Postoperative Aortic Imaging in Marfan Syndrome.–After elective aortic root replacement, dismissal or early (within 6 months) TTE and CT or MRI are generally performed to establish a baseline aortic assessment for patients with Marfan syndrome. Annual TTE and CT or MRI of the aorta are generally recommended after aortic root replacement. The frequency of aortic imaging is individualized depending on patient characteristics, such as the type of operation performed and the extent of aortic dilatation elsewhere. Serial postoperative follow-up imaging should focus on progression of disease affecting the native aorta, and common postoperative complications, including the development of pseudoaneurysm and coronary anastomotic aneurysms.
c. Postdissection Aortic Imaging in Marfan Syndrome.–Patients with Marfan syndrome with repaired type A aortic dissection should undergo serial aortic imaging with CTor MRI; the imaging frequency depends on the extent of aortic dissection and the type of repair. Patients with Marfan syndrome with type B aortic dissection that has not been repaired require regular follow-up imaging (see section III.B, ‘‘Aortic Dissection’’).
d. Family Screening.–Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomaldominant fashion, so transthoracic echocardiographic screening is recommended for the ﬁrst-degree relatives of an affected individual unless a gene mutation has been identiﬁed and genetic testing can be used to identify affected family members.1 All affected family members should undergo regular aortic imaging. Although there are no speciﬁc guideline recommendations for ‘‘regular’’ imaging, serial imaging should depend on the age and speciﬁc features of a given individual.
2. Other Genetic Diseases of the Aorta in Adults. Two genetic conditions associated with thoracic aortic disease, BAV and Marfan syndrome, are relatively common and are discussed elsewhere in this review. Many additional predisposing conditions for aortic aneurysm formation and dissection are listed in Table 18. The scope of this document does not permit a detailed discussion of these less common entities, but a few pertinent details are mentioned. Importantly, awareness of these disorders and their potential risk is critical not only to presenting patients but also to their close relatives.

a. Turner Syndrome.–Women with Turner syndrome are at risk for BAV, aortic coarctation, and aortic dilatation or dissection. Aortic dilatation in patients with Turner syndrome has been reported to occur in up to 40% of cases. Imaging of the aorta in these patients must include the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and proximal descending aorta. As in other cases, aortic dilatation coexists with a BAV and/or coarctation.256-258 Patients with Turner syndrome have a small stature compared with same-age individuals in the general population, so all aortic measurements should be indexed to BSA. An indexed aortic diameter of >2 cm/m2 in the ascending aorta should be followed annually, as the risk for aortic dissection is increased.258
b. Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.–Loeys-Dietz syndrome results from a gene mutation of transforming growth factor b receptor 1 or 2 and is inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion.259 Aortic root aneurysms are present in the majority of patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Involvement of other aortic segments and smaller arteries in the form of aneurysms or marked tortuosity are characteristic in this population.259,260 Dissection can occur at dimensions smaller than in other inherited disorders of connective tissue. Although an annual comprehensive arterial imaging protocol with MDCT or MRI has been recommended,261 the strategy for follow-up is not well established and should be individualized from annually to every 2 to 3 years depending on abnormalities present, family risk of complications, and degree of evolution. Interpretation should include information about the caliber of the aortic root, the ascending and descending aorta, and the pulmonary artery (pulmonary artery dilatation may also occur). If progression of aortic disease has occurred, it should be monitored every 6 months (every 12 months for other arteries) given the markedly increased risk for dissection or rupture.
c. Familial TAAs.–Different gene mutations have been identiﬁed in familial TAAs, predominantly with an autosomal-dominant inheritance. Aneurysms in relatives may be seen in the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta, or the cerebral circulation. Therefore, comprehensive imaging for screening of ﬁrst-order relatives of probands with TAA is advisable.262 The frequency and modality of vascular imaging in affected persons is similar to that outlined for Marfan syndrome but should be individualized.263
d. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.–The vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder with vascular involvement characterized by arterial dilatation and rupture. The role of aortic imaging in this population is less clear. Elective surgical repair of aortic aneurysms or other vascular involvement carries a high risk because of due to tissue fragility, so the impact of serial aortic imaging is unclear.264
3. BAV-Related Aortopathy. a. Bicuspid Valve–Related Aort-
opathy.–BAVs affect 1% to 2% of the population and are often associated with aortopathy.265-269 Nearly 50% of patients with BAVs have dilatation of either the aortic root or ascending aorta.247,268,270 Dilatation of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta can also occur but is less common. Recently, it has been reported that patients with BAVs also are at increased risk for intracranial aneurysms compared with the normal population,271 although the clinical signiﬁcance of this is unknown. Progressive dilatation of the aorta may occur irrespective of the functional status of the BAV and places patients at increased risk for aortic dissection or rupture.272,273 Patients with BAVs may also have coexisting coronary artery anomalies, including reversal of dominance, short left main coronary artery (<10 mm), and anomalous origin of the left circumﬂex artery from the right coronary

cusp.250,270,274-278 Failure to recognize these anomalies may result in risk for coronary artery injury during aortic valve repair or replacement.
b. Imaging of the Aorta in Patients with Unoperated BAVs.–TTE is the primary imaging tool for the initial diagnosis and screening as well as serial follow-up of patients with known or suspected BAVs with or without aortopathy. The aortic root or ascending aorta may be dilated. The pattern of dilatation may be associated with BAV morphology.269 At the time of initial diagnosis of aortopathy in patients with BAVs, imaging with CT or MRI is generally recommended to conﬁrm that the size of the aorta measured by TTE is accurate. Eccentric dilatation of the aortic sinus adjacent to the conjoined cusp increases the chance of underestimation of the aortic root measurement by TTE, particularly when the measurement is obtained only in the long-axis format. CT and MRI also provide important information about the size of the aortic arch and descending aortic segments, which are often incompletely visualized by TTE (Figure 49). Although BAV occurs in >50% of patients with coarctation, coarctation is noted in <10% of patients with BAVs. Nevertheless, whenever a BAV is detected, coarctation should always be sought.
c. Follow-Up Imaging of the Aorta in Patients with Unoperated BAVs.–All patients with BAVs and associated aortopathy should undergo annual surveillance imaging of the ascending aorta to monitor growth over time. TTE can be used to monitor the aortic root and ascending aorta when correlation between the dimensions measured by TTE and CT or MRI has been conﬁrmed. After the identiﬁcation of ascending aortic enlargement in a patient with BAV, repeat imaging after 6 months is recommended. If the aorta remains stable at 6-month follow-up and is <45 mm in size, and there is no family or personal history of aortic dissection, annual aortic imaging is recommended. Patients who do not meet these criteria should undergo repeat aortic imaging using TTE every 6 months. Occasionally, patients with BAV-related aortopathy have demon-

strated stable dilatation of the ascending aorta over several years; the frequency of aortic follow-up in these patients should be individualized. Patients with BAVs and no demonstrable aortopathy should be screened every 3 to 5 years with TTE for the development of aortic enlargement.
Repeat CTor MRI is suggested at least every 3 to 5 years to reassess the aortic arch and descending aorta and reconﬁrm that transthoracic echocardiographic measurements of the aortic root remain reliable for serial measurements.
TEE is generally not used for initial diagnosis and follow-up of BAVrelated aortopathy, because of its semi-invasive nature and difﬁculty comparing dimensions over time.
Patients with BAVs with aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic arch or descending thoracic aorta or those with remote histories of type B aortic dissection require regular computed tomographic angiography or MRI to monitor aortic stability. In such cases, imaging should be repeated annually. TTE does not provide reliable imaging for serial follow-up of the dimensions of these portions of the aorta.
d. Postoperative Aortic Imaging in Patients with BAV-Related Aortopathy.–After elective aortic root replacement, early (dismissal or within 6 months) TTE and CT or MRI are generally performed to establish a baseline aortic and valve assessment. During the imaging study, it is critical to know what surgical procedure was performed to identify potential residua or sequelae (Figure 50). Annual aortic imaging is generally recommended after aortic root replacement or replacement of the aorta above the coronary arteries; however, the frequency is individualized depending on patient characteristics, type of operation performed, and duration of follow-up. Dilatation of the remaining ascending aorta, aortic arch, or descending thoracic aorta may continue after the ascending aorta has been replaced. Serial postoperative follow-up imaging should also focus on common postoperative complications, including the development of coronary button pseudoaneurysm formation, anastomotic site pseudoaneurysm formation, and progressive dilatation of other aortic segments.

V. TRAUMATIC INJURY TO THE THORACIC AORTA
Traumatic injuries to the aorta may result from either blunt (nonpenetrating, indirect) or sharp (penetrating, direct) trauma. Penetrating trauma is usually caused by stab or bullet wounds that puncture the aortic wall. Rare causes include misplacement of spinal ﬁxation screws and lacerations from spinal fractures.280,281 Penetrating aortic trauma injures the aorta from outside to inside, does not have a predilection for site, and is usually fatal.280,282-284 Blunt aortic injuries (BAIs) are far more common and are therefore the focus of this review.
In BAI, the aortic wall is damaged from the inside to the outside, from the intima to the adventitia. The most common location of

Table 20 CXR ﬁndings associated with BAIs

Rightward deviation of the trachea or nasogastric tube Obscured aortic knob Opaciﬁcation of the aortopulmonary window Downward displacement of the left main stem bronchus Widened right paratracheal stripe Left apical pleural cap First and/or second rib fracture Clavicle, sternal, or thoracic spine fracture Hemothorax Intrathoracic free air
BAI is at the aortic isthmus just distal to the left subclavian artery.284-287 The second most common location is the supravalvular portion of the ascending aorta.285,286,288,289 Motor vehicle accidents (especially at speeds of >40 mph) account for 75% of cases in most series of BAI,280,287,290,291 but falls from heights of >10 feet, crush injuries, explosions, motorcycle and aircraft crashes, pedestrian injuries, and direct blows to the chest are also known to produce similar injuries.284,290-292
A. Pathology
The aortic isthmus is the most common location for BAI (80%–95%), followed by the ascending aorta and then the diaphragmatic aorta.284,286-289 Those regions represent transition points between relatively ﬁxed and mobile aortic segments. These transition points have the greatest exposure to shear and hydrostatic forces generated by abrupt deceleration. Unfortunately, investigators in the ﬁeld have not been consistent in the terms they use to describe the result of BAI. Pathologists have described these injuries as tears, lacerations, disruptions, transactions, ruptures, dissections, and pseudoaneurysms. Even modern imaging modalities may not be able to deﬁne an injury in terms that are precisely consistent with pathologic descriptions. In this text, descriptive terms are used for the pathologic abnormalities that correlate with various imaging methods. Descriptions of images should include the site of the lesion (i.e., ascending aorta, aortic arch, isthmus, descending thoracic aorta, or abdominal aorta), as well as an estimate of the distance of the lesion from a reference anatomic structure (e.g., the aortic valve, the origin of the left subclavian artery, and the diaphragm). The description should also include the length of the aortic injury (in millimeters) and the total circumference of the aorta at the site of its injury.
A variety of aortic lesions can result from blunt aortic trauma.
1. Subadventitial aortic rupture involving the intima and media with incomplete circumferential extension: In this most frequent lesion encountered by imaging physicians, there is a discrete tear involving the intima and underlying media. The disrupted aortic wall (intima and media) usually protrudes into the aortic lumen, and through the disrupted wall, the aortic lumen communicates with a cavity (saccular false aneurysm) whose wall is composed only of adventitia. The inner surface of the aorta presents an abrupt discontinuation, and the outer contour is deformed by the false aneurysm. The protrusion of the torn aortic wall into the aortic lumen may produce ‘‘stenosis’’ with ﬂow acceleration and a gradient (pseudocoarctation).
2. Subadventitial aortic rupture involving the intima and media with complete circumferential extension (aortic transection): This lesion results in a fusiform

pseudoaneurysm. Because the intima and media tear is circumferential, protrusion into the lumen does not occur. The inner surface of the aneurysm is smooth, formed solely by adventitia. As a consequence, the aortic wall is extremely thin and fragile. Imaging typically reveals abrupt change in aortic diameter. 3. IMH: Accumulation of blood within the media may result from blunt aortic trauma because of disruption of the vasa vasorum or the development of small intimal tears. The aortic wall shows a localized, usually crescentic thickening (usually >5 mm). The inner aortic surface is smooth, the aortic lumen is partially reduced, and the outer aortic contour is unaltered. There is no ﬂap and no ﬂow signals within the hematoma. 4. Traumatic aortic dissection: The elastic and collagen ﬁbers of the aortic wall are remarkably strong radially but may relatively easily be split when exposed to transaxial stress. As is true of spontaneous aortic dissection, aortic trauma may produce separation of the media. This lesion is uncommon and can mimic spontaneous aortic dissection but has signiﬁcant differences. It is usually localized to the area of the aortic injury and does not propagate distally toward the iliac arteries. It typically fails to create two channels and may have a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the aorta. Consequently, the resulting ‘‘ﬂap’’ is usually thicker and less mobile than the classical intimal ﬂap. The aorta is usually symmetrically enlarged. 5. Lesion of the aortic branches: Partial or total avulsion, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, and thrombosis may occur as isolated injuries to branch arteries or in association with BAI. 6. Superﬁcial lesions involving only the intima: With improvements in imaging technology, ever more subtle lesions are being identiﬁed. The term minimal aortic injury is often used to describe a lesion that carries a relatively low risk for rupture. Ten percent of BAIs diagnosed with high-resolution techniques have minimal aortic injuries.293 Although most of these intimal injuries heal spontaneously and hence may not require surgical repair, the natural history of these injuries is unknown.294,295 Frank tears produced by BAI but limited to the intima appear as thin, linear mobile intraluminal projections from the aortic wall. No alterations of the diameter or external contour of the aorta are present. Thrombi, often mobile, may be present within the aortic lumen, presumably in areas of exposed collagen. Minimal aortic injury from an imaging standpoint is an injury with the intimal ﬂap <10 mm, accompanied by minimal or no periaortic mediastinal hematoma.293
B. Imaging Modalities On the basis of a landmark study by Parmley et al.,284 aortography was considered the best study to identify BAI for >40 years. However, aortography is invasive, requires a special team for its performance, and is prone to both false-positive and false-negative results, rendering it a poor choice for screening.296-299 CT is now the diagnostic test of choice.285,287,300-304 Other options for the diagnosis of blunt traumatic aortic injury include CXR, TEE, IVUS, and MRI. Each of the imaging techniques has relative advantages and disadvantages.
1. CXR. Although a plain CXR is often an initial study in emergency departments and can sometimes suggest aortic injury, even when the image is not of diagnostic quality, no single or combination of radiographic signs demonstrates sufﬁcient sensitivity or speciﬁcity to reliably

Table 23 Disadvantages of TEE in blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury
Difﬁculty imaging distal ascending aorta Difﬁculty evaluating arch vessels Operator dependent (requires skilled operator)  Training and experience required  Availability Not always safe in patients with facial, cervical, spine, oropharynx, or esophageal injuries Reverberation artifact
detect or exclude traumatic aortic rupture.241,280,305 Therefore, further imaging should be performed whenever an abnormality is suspected on clinical presentation or on CXR or when the mechanism of injury is compatible with aortic injury. The most signiﬁcant CXR ﬁndings include, but are not limited to, widened mediastinum, an obscured aortic knob, rightward deviation of the trachea or nasogastric tube, and opaciﬁcation of the aortopulmonary window. A more complete list of CXR ﬁndings seen in BAI is shown in Table 20.
2. Aortography. As mentioned, selective contrast aortography was long considered to be the reference standard examination for the diagnosis of traumatic aortic injury. Compared with necropsy, prior reports claimed sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and accuracy approaching 100%,296,299,306 but with the introduction of CT and TEE, the failings of aortography became readily apparent. Indeed, modern CT and TEE are able to identify minimal injuries such as intimal tears, which constitute up to 10% of BAIs, whereas such injuries cannot be detected by contrast aortography. Moreover, signiﬁcant interobserver variability in the interpretation of aortographic images has been reported. On an aortogram, the diagnosis of an intimal injury requires the demonstration of an intimal irregularity or ﬁlling defect caused by an intimal ﬂap.307 The presence of contrast media outside the lumen of the aorta is an important sign of transmural laceration: when the leak is contained, it may be termed a pseudoaneurysm, whereas free extravasation indicates frank rupture.307 Diagnostic pitfalls of aortography for blunt thoracic aortic injury include the ductus diverticulum, the aortic spindle (a short segment of fusiform dilatation of the aorta just distal to the isthmus), atherosclerotic disease, artifacts from streaming or mixing of contrast media, and motion artifacts.
3. CT. The introduction of multidetector computed tomographic angiography, with up to eightfold reduction in scan times, made wholebody CT technically feasible,308,309 and over the past decade, CT has almost completely replaced aortography and TEE as the ﬁrst-line imaging test for BAI.300-304 Some of the advantages of MDCT include

superb diagnostic accuracy, availability, and speed. Importantly, at most trauma centers, CT of the thorax in patients at risk for BAI is not performed as a sole examination but is rather integrated into a whole-body CT—the so-called trauma panscan—with unique ability to identify associated injuries in the same diagnostic sitting (brain, facial bones, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis). This latter technique has been shown to improve survival and reduce imaging time.307,310,311
Computed tomographic ﬁndings (both direct and indirect signs) in BAI are listed in Table 21. Nonaxial reconstructions of thin-section slices and careful evaluation of the aortic wall as well as exclusion of periaortic hemorrhage or hematomas may help in making an accurate diagnosis.303,310 Although the presence of periaortic hemorrhage should lead to careful evaluation of the aorta for evidence of injury, conversely, the absence of a hematoma does not exclude aortic injury. Therefore, both aortography and TEE still have a role, especially in difﬁcult cases and instances in which CT ﬁndings are equivocal.280,303,310 In addition, there is still a role for aortography in some patients in whom branch-vessel injury is suspected, when there is a need to evaluate and manage active bleeding at other sites and in the planning of endovascular management.304
4. TEE. Because of its wide availability, portability, and accuracy, as well as the fact that no contrast medium is required, TEE is also a powerful diagnostic tool that gained popularity as a ﬁrst-line study in the 1990s,312-319 with reported sensitivities and speciﬁcities as high as 100% and 98%, respectively.315 However, subsequent studies failed to conﬁrm such high accuracy of TEE in suspected BAI.320-322 Thus, its use as a ﬁrst-line diagnostic tool is controversial. Furthermore, TEE may fail to adequately image the distal ascending aorta (TEE’s known blind spot) and may not identify all of the branches of the aortic arch.317-320 TEE is heavily operator dependent, and inexperience can lead to both false-positive and false-negative results.

Moreover, a skilled operator may not be available at night and on weekends. Additionally, patients with craniofacial trauma, cervical spine injuries, and airway concerns may not be suitable candidates for TEE. Last, as described above, patients with multiple traumatic injuries are likely to better served by a comprehensive computed tomographic scan rather than multiple individual diagnostic examinations.
One important role for TEE may be its ability to follow small or questionable intimal injuries that may not be seen well with either aortography or CT. In addition, TEE may be the only modality suitable for patients who require immediate laparotomy to control ongoing hemorrhage before CT. Tables 22 and 23 list some of the relative advantages and disadvantages of TEE for evaluating BAI.
Transesophageal echocardiographic ﬁndings in patients with BAIs include (1) dilatation in the region of the isthmus, (2) an abnormal aortic contour, (3) an intraluminal medial ﬂap, (4) a pseudoaneurysm, (5) a crescentic or circumferential thickening of the aortic wall (IMH), and (6) mobile linear echodensities attached to the aortic wall consistent with an intimal tear or a thrombus. Similar ﬁndings are seen in patients with spontaneous aortic dissection, but there are some important differences. With traumatic aortic injury, the medial ﬂap tends to be thicker, has greater mobility, and is typically perpendicular (rather than parallel) to the aortic wall so that there is an absence of two channels. The aortic contour is usually deformed because of the presence of a localized pseudoaneurysm. Last, with traumatic aortic injury, the ﬁndings are conﬁned to the isthmus region, rather than propagating distally all the way to the iliac arteries.
5. IVUS. There is limited information on the role of IVUS for evaluating BAI. IVUS, like helical CT but unlike aortography, can visualize the lumen and both the aortic wall and the periaortic structures. Although limited by the absence of a reference-standard technique, a recent study found that IVUS performed better than catheter

aortography in patients who had equivocal computed tomographic ﬁndings.323 A decided disadvantage of IVUS is its limited ﬁeld of view. In addition, the high cost of disposable transducers and the invasive nature limit IVUS to a problem-solving tool at present.323
6. MRI. Until very recently, MRI has had limited applicability in the evaluation of acute aortic trauma. Its examination times are long, and access to patients is limited while they are in the magnet. MRI is not commonly used to evaluate injury to the thoracic great vessels in the acute phase, and few data are available in this setting. It can, however, be particularly useful for detecting the hemorrhagic component of a traumatic lesion. MRI is also an excellent method in the chronic phase of aortic trauma when serial examinations are required.324,325 This is especially true if there is a contraindication to computed tomographic angiography. Modern MRI sequences allow both contrast and noncontrast techniques. Although these noncontrast techniques may be more time consuming, they may be of particular beneﬁt in more stable patients with renal insufﬁciency, in whom iodinated contrast may be relatively contraindicated.
C. Imaging Algorithm
Contrast-enhanced MDCT is currently the preferred ﬁrst-line imaging technique for suspected BAI, especially for patients with multiple injuries. Injuries to several organ systems (e.g., the brain, cervical spine, and abdomen and pelvis) can be detected in a matter of minutes, and diagnostic accuracy in both the detection and exclusion of acute traumatic aortic injury with both single-detector CT and MDCT is quite high.302-304 Very importantly, the negative predictive value approaches 100% in some studies.302 Although in most cases aortography is not necessary, there may be a role when branch-vessel injury is suspected and in the planning of endovascular therapy.325 TEE and aortography are reserved for instances in which computed tomographic ﬁndings are equivocal. In some hemodynamically unstable patients, TEE may be a ﬁrst-line technique, especially if CT requires transportation to a remote area. Recommendations for choice of imaging modality are listed in Table 24.

D. Imaging in Endovascular Repair TEVAR is increasingly being used for acute aortic injury.326,327 In the past, TEVAR was used selectively in high-risk patients with signiﬁcant comorbidities. However, as experience with the technique has increased, in many institutions TEVAR has become the preferred interventional approach for BAI.
Imaging plays a key role when TEVAR is used to treat BAI. Measurements of aortic diameter should be based on aortic measurements obtained preoperatively by computed tomographic angiography or by IVUS. Length of graft coverage should be based on intraoperative aortography or IVUS measurements. Postprocedurally, aortography of the grafted segment is usually performed. Follow-up imaging is based on guidelines for evaluating endografting for nontraumatic aortic aneurysms, with computed tomographic angiography performed at 48 hours, at the time of discharge, and at 1, 6, and 12 months postprocedurally.280
VI. AORTIC COARCTATION
Aortic coarctation is a relatively uncommon congenital cardiovascular disorder. It is most commonly located just distal to the left subclavian artery. Aortic coarctation causes reduced blood ﬂow to the lower body, which can present as hypertension and congestive heart failure early in life, or may be identiﬁed when a search for a cause of hypertension is performed later in life.
Patients with aortic coarctation also have a form of vasculopathy with increased risk for aneurysm formation in the ascending aorta, at the site of coarctation repair, and in the intracranial vasculature.328 A BAV is present in >50% of patients with aortic coarctation.
The diagnosis of aortic coarctation can usually be made using TTE with Doppler imaging. The area of coarctation is often identiﬁed by 2D transthoracic echocardiographic techniques with color-ﬂow imaging. Pulsed-wave Doppler assessment of the abdominal aorta in patients with severe aortic coarctation demonstrates reduced and

delayed forward ﬂow in systole as well as continuation of forward ﬂow in diastole (Figure 51) compared with the normal pattern of brisk forward ﬂow in systole followed by early reversal of ﬂow in diastole in persons without coarctation. Pulsed-wave Doppler is also used to measure the velocity in the descending aorta proximal to the region of obstruction. The peak and mean velocities and peak, mean, and maximum instantaneous gradients across the region of coarctation are measured by continuous-wave Doppler techniques and are used to help determine the severity of obstruction. It can be difﬁcult to determine the severity of aortic coarctation obstruction by Doppler echocardiographic techniques alone when extensive collateral vessels are present. The exact site, length, degree of obstruction, and presence and extent of collateral vessels are best conﬁrmed by CT or MRI (Figure 52).
Dilatation of the ascending aorta in patients with aortic coarctation is generally easily visualized by TTE, but dilatation of the coarctation repair site in the descending thoracic aorta is not well seen by TTE (Figure 53). These associated aortic complications emphasize the importance of multimodality imaging in patients with both unoperated and repaired aortic coarctation. Some key points related to multimodality imaging of coarctation are listed in Table 25.

TTE can usually conﬁrm the clinical diagnosis of aortic coarctation and is used to identify associated cardiovascular disorders such as BAV (present in >50% of patients with coarctation) and aortic dilatation.

segments incompletely visualized by TTE. Patients with mild degrees of coarctation who do not require intervention should undergo annual TTE and periodic (every 3–5 years) CT or MRI to monitor for changes in the aorta. TEE is generally not used for initial diagnosis or follow-up of coarctation, because of its semi-invasive nature and difﬁculty comparing degree of obstruction over time.

Therefore, the detection of aortic atherosclerosis on imaging has prognostic implications.

B. Postoperative Aortic Imaging in Coarctation
Patients with prior coarctation repair require regular informed cardiovascular follow-up and imaging to evaluate for clinical and cardiovascular complications such as recurrent coarctation, ascending and descending thoracic aortic dilatation, and aortic dissection.329
Patients with complex recoarctation or coarctation and associated cardiovascular disease that requires operative intervention, such as coronary artery disease or aortic stenosis, may have an ascendingto-descending aortic bypass graft placed. These grafts can be partially visualized by TTE but require comprehensive imaging with CT or MRI to determine patency (Figure 54).
VII. ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Various terms have been used to describe the appearance of atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta on imaging. The simplest lesions are usually reported as ‘‘atheroma’’ or ‘‘atheromatous plaque.’’ When mobile components are seen attached to these plaques, the terms ruptured plaque, mobile plaque, mobile debris, and superimposed thrombi are used. Some believe that mobile echodensities represent ﬁbrous caps of ruptured plaques,330 but autopsy and surgically examined specimens indicate that they are most often superimposed thrombi.331-335 Supporting the latter conclusion, mobile lesions have been shown to disappear after anticoagulant therapy.336 Both necropsy337 and TEE338,339 have demonstrated that the frequency and severity of atherosclerotic plaque is lowest in the ascending aorta, greater in the arch, and greatest in the descending thoracic aorta.
A growing body of evidence has established an association between echocardiographically demonstrated aortic atheroma and

A. Plaque Morphology and Classiﬁcation
On ultrasound examination, the normal aortic wall is seen as two parallel echogenic lines separated by a relatively hypoechoic space (Figure 55). The inner line represents the luminal-intimal interface, whereas the outer line represents the medial-adventitial border. Thus, the distance between the lines reﬂects the combined thickness of the intima and media, the ‘‘intimal-medial thickness,’’350 which is normally #1 mm. Moreover, the normal aortic wall has a smooth, continuous surface. Any irregular thickening of $2 mm on TEE is therefore considered to be an atheroma.331
Aortic atherosclerosis has been classiﬁed on the basis of plaque characteristics of thickness, presence or absence of mobile components, and presence or absence of ulceration. Plaque thickness is considered to be a more objective and reliable measure of atheroma severity than is plaque morphology. Therefore, most grading systems are based on the maximal plaque thickness in the most diseased segment. Because there is currently no standard or universal grading system for reporting the severity of atherosclerosis, the grading system outlined in Table 26 and illustrated in Figure 56 was devised. This classiﬁcation scheme, based on a review of multiple existing schemes,344,351-363 represents a unanimous consensus of the writing committee. In this scheme, grades 1 to 4 represent progressive increases in maximum atheroma thickness from none to severe. Instead of the terms mild, moderate, and severe, some imagers may prefer the terms small, moderate, and large. Until any of these grading systems has been correlated with outcomes in a large prospective study, we recommend classifying aortic atheroma as simple or complex on the basis of the presence or absence of mobile components or ulceration(s). Although semiquantitative, the observations used in this simple classiﬁcation (atheroma thickness,

Small arrow indicates a mobile component of the plaque.

presence or absence of mobile components, and presence or absence of ulceration) are relatively objective and reproducible.
Furthermore, we, like most authors, designate any plaque, regardless of thickness, to be complex if there are mobile components or ulcerations. One group subdivided mobile lesions as (1) discrete 1- to 2-mm mobile lesions; (2) long, slender lesions that move freely in the pulsatile ﬂow of the aorta; and (3) large masses that rock in place with aortic blood ﬂow.330 However, a simpler and more widely used classiﬁcation has also been proposed by Thenappan et al.362 In this scheme, plaques are considered ‘‘stable’’ when they are calciﬁed, immobile, echodense, and homogeneous and lack signs of ulceration. They are considered ‘‘unstable’’ if they are mobile, nonhomogeneous, ulcerated, or spongiform. Another group derived a ‘‘total plaque burden score’’ from the addition of the circumferential extent of the plaque to its thickness.360
The major limitation of the existing classiﬁcation systems, including ours, is the failure to account for the overall plaque burden in terms of its extent over the length of the thoracic aorta or a segment of the aorta. Therefore, it is recommended to report whether the atheromas are localized or diffuse.
B. Imaging Modalities
1. Echocardiography. Until the advent of TEE, the aorta was an underrecognized source of systemic embolism. Now, because of its ability to obtain high-resolution images of the aortic intimalumen interface and detect mobile components, calciﬁcation, and ulceration,364 TEE has become the procedure of choice for both detecting aortic atheroma and assessing atheroma size and morphology.
Important plaque features associated with an increased risk for embolization are protrusion of the plaque into the aortic lumen $4 mm, often with an irregular plaque surface (sometimes resembling a ‘‘seabed,’’ especially using 3D echocardiography),365 ulceration, and superimposed mobile components. Additionally,

hypoechoic atheromas may represent noncalciﬁed, lipid-laden plaques that are prone to rupture and thrombosis, although ultrasound is not a reliable discriminator of plaque composition. To deﬁne the location of plaques accurately and reproducibly, the distance of the probe tip from the teeth (incisors) should be noted.
Nevertheless, TEE has several shortcomings. Its resolution may be compromised by near-ﬁeld distortion, a limitation inherent in any ultrasound technique: the anterior third of the aorta in cross-section is often less well imaged because it is adjacent to the esophagus and thus in the near ﬁeld of the transducer. In addition, air in the trachea and right main stem bronchus often creates a blind spot that may limit visualization of the distal ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch. In addition, determination of plaque extent and/or complexity may be limited when using (2D TEE), because only one plane can be visualized or measured at a time. Single-plane views may not appreciate an asymptomatic plaque and may mistake a single lobulated plaque for two separate plaques. Piazzese et al.366 demonstrated that 3D TEE provides superior visualization of the number, morphology, volume, and spatial extent of aortic atheromas compared with 2D TEE.
Although atherosclerosis of the aorta is occasionally detected on TTE from the suprasternal view, TTE is not a reliable technique for the detection or characterization of atheroma.
2. Epiaortic Ultrasound (EAU). Because atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta is associated with an increased risk for perioperative stroke,360,365,367-371 some centers use intraoperative measures to try to reduce the incidence of cerebral injury and neurocognitive deﬁcits.367,370,372,373 Three approaches have been used: digital palpation of the aorta, TEE, and EAU.353,368,374,375 Several investigators have demonstrated that EAU is superior to both manual palpation and TEE for detecting atheroma in the ascending aorta and arch.368,375,376 Its high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility make it a clinically useful tool.377 Compared with TEE, EAU has better resolution, less artifact, no blind spot, and

superior detection of disease in the mid and distal ascending aorta. Moreover, EAU also appears to be superior to preoperative CT for this purpose.378 For a more detailed discussion of EAU, the reader is referred to the excellent guidelines on this topic.379
Nevertheless, despite the strengths of EAU, intraoperative TEE is still used more often than EAU for several reasons. First, at many centers TEE is routinely used in cardiac surgery to monitor volume and ventricular function and to evaluate the adequacy of the surgical procedure, so it has become the most common way aortic atheromas are detected. Second, despite its potential superiority, EAU is less widely available in most operating rooms than is TEE, and therefore surgeons and anesthesiologists have less experience working with it than with TEE. Nevertheless, EAU should be available in instances in which TEE is contraindicated or the rare instances in which the TEE probe cannot be inserted. In addition, some groups perform EAU before nonaortic surgery (e.g., coronary bypass grafting) in select ‘‘high-risk’’ patients (for atherosclerosis), including those aged > 75 years, with peripheral vascular disease, with histories of cerebrovascular disease, with palpable calciﬁcations on the ascending aorta, and with ﬁndings on TEE. The ﬁnding of prominent atheromas may lead to modiﬁcations of surgical techniques.
During an epiaortic scan, mapping of the distribution of aortic atheromas should be performed. The ascending aorta may be divided into proximal, middle, and distal thirds. Each segment may have atheroma in its anterior, posterior, lateral, and medial walls, and details of plaque location should be conveyed to the surgeon.380
3. CT. Multidetector computed tomographic angiography of the aorta can also be used to detect aortic atheroma. Its sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and overall accuracy for identifying severe aortic atheroma approaches that of TEE.381,382 The degree of x-ray attenuation may be used to estimate the composition of atherosclerotic plaque.383 Calciﬁed plaque appears as a light, high-attenuation signal, whereas lipid-rich or ﬁbrous plaque appears as hypoattenuated dark signals within the vessel wall. However, quantiﬁcation is limited by calcium-provoked ‘‘blooming ar-

tifacts,’’ which may lead to overestimation of calciﬁed plaques.381 One potential advantage of MDCT is its ability to image the entire aorta in a continuous manner, which is not possible by TEE (including areas poorly visualized by TEE), allowing the assessment of aortic plaque burden in the entire thoracic aorta in a semiquantitative fashion.384 Although MDCT can identify high-risk atherosclerotic features before cardiac surgery, unlike TEE and EAU, it cannot be used in the operating room during surgery. Other limitations of MDCTare the relatively high radiation dose associated with its use and the requirement for contrast agents for aortic imaging. However, newer computed tomographic imaging techniques may require lower radiation doses in the evaluation of the aorta.
4. MRI. MRI, another alternative for detecting and evaluating aortic atherosclerosis, can supply information about plaque characteristics.385,386 However, MRI has limited utility for assessing the mobile thrombi that are often superimposed on plaques. Moreover, its spatial resolution is inferior to that of CT.387 Compared with TEE, MRI overestimates plaque thickness and consequently classiﬁes more patients as at high risk ($4-mm plaque thickness).388 In addition, whereas transesophageal echocardiographic measurements of aortic plaque are very reproducible, the reproducibility of MRI measurements is less well established. Thus, this technology has not yet gained wide clinical acceptance and is a less cost-effective method for detection of aortic atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, MRI remains promising because of unique potential to characterize plaque composition,383 which is more reliable than TEE for this purpose. Both contrast-enhanced and noncontrast MRI techniques have been developed, but most remain in the nonclinical realm at this time.
C. Imaging Algorithm
TEE, CT, and MRI are powerful diagnostic tools for visualizing aortic atheromas. In patients with stroke or peripheral embolism, TEE is the technique of choice because it affords excellent assessment of the size

sively distinguish various components of the plaque, such as ﬁbrous cap, lipid core, and thrombus, thereby assessing plaque stability. In T2-weighted images, ﬁbrous cap and thrombus are seen as a high-intensity signal, and lipid core is seen as a low-intensity signal. Although CT can distinguish calciﬁed plaque from ﬁbrolipid plaque, this method is less efﬁcient than MRI for the characterization of atherosclerotic plaque composition, and standard MDCT without electrocardiographic gating does not assess plaque mobility.
TEE is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing aortic atherosclerosis and atheromas. Advantages of TEE over other noninvasive modalities (CT and MRI) include the ability to accurately measure the size and mobility of plaque and overlying thrombi in real time. When atherosclerosis is present, the severity and location of the most severe atheromas should be reported. In patients in whom the suprasternal window is optimal, plaques in the aortic arch may be detected by TTE.

and mobility of complicated plaques. CT can image the entire aorta (including areas poorly visualized by TEE) but requires exposure to radiation and the use of contrast agents. MRI can noninvasively distinguish various components of the plaque, such as ﬁbrous cap, lipid core, and thrombus thereby assessing plaque stability. Serial MRI or CT can be used to monitor progression or regression of atheromatous plaques after therapy with lipid-lowering agents. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the various imaging techniques for atherosclerosis are summarized in Table 27.

VIII. AORTITIS
A. Mycotic Aneurysms of the Aorta Mycotic aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are extremely uncommon, but they are important because they are potentially life threatening. Untreated, a mycotic aneurysm may lead to septic thromboembolism, rupture, or death. Osler389 coined the term mycotic aneurysm in 1885, describing a mushroom-shaped aneurysm that resembled a fungal growth. However, this term is a misnomer, because the vast majority of infected aneurysms are bacterial and not fungal. So the term has since been broadened to include all aneurysms with an infectious component.

Figure 58 MR images from a 54-year-old woman with elevated sedimentation rate and dilation of the descending aorta. Wall thickening is well depicted in dark blood images (left, yellow arrow). Short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images (right) demonstrate bright signals in the aortic wall (yellow arrow), a result consistent with edema. Surgical repair was performed in this patient, and histology was consistent with GCA.

Mycotic aortic aneurysms most often result from septic emboli in patients with left-sided endocarditis, so one should consider imaging the thoracic aorta to exclude mycotic aneurysms in patients with mitral or aortic valve endocarditis. Aortic seeding may also result from bloodborne dissemination from an infection anywhere in the body. Mycotic aneurysms may also be associated with aortic trauma caused by accidents, surgical manipulation, or invasive diagnostic procedures.390,391
The classical triad of fever, abdominal, back, or chest pain, and leukocytosis is present in the majority of patients.392,393 Aortic infections should be considered when such classic signs and symptoms cannot otherwise be explained. Therefore, suspicion must be heightened in immunosuppressed patients and in those with open or endovascular implants.394,395 Once suspected, the diagnosis should be pursued vigorously because progression is the rule. Figure 57 illustrates such a case and also emphasizes the potential for rapid progression.
Aortography is no longer the diagnostic modality of choice, but characteristic aortographic features include either saccular or fusiform aortic aneurysm with a normal appearance of the adjacent regions of the aorta.396,397 However, these ﬁndings are nonspeciﬁc and unreliable. Moreover, aortography images only the aortic lumen (and not the aortic wall) and could potentially induce an aortic rupture when the wall is fragile.
Echocardiography, CT, and MRI are now the preferred imaging techniques. Contrast-enhanced CT may reveal a change in aortic size, saccular aneurysm formation, periaortic nodularity, and/or air in the aortic wall. However, milder degrees of inﬂammation or aortic wall edema may be missed.394,398,399 MRI with gadolinium contrast enhancement is another useful imaging modality. In addition to detection of an aneurysm, associated aortitis may appear as vessel wall edema, enhancement, or wall thickening. Speciﬁc protocols have been developed, such as the ‘‘edema-weighted’’ technique, that may detect even small changes within and around the aortic wall.394 In addition, these noninvasive imaging techniques may allow rapid exclusion of other aortic pathologies that may resemble aortic infection, such as aortic dissection, IMH, and PAU.
Recently, 18F ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography appears to hold promise for diagnosing mycotic aneurysms and graft

infections by detecting hypermetabolic activity, as elevated 18F ﬂuorodeoxyglucose uptake within the aortic wall is suggestive of active vascular infection.379 Response to antibiotic therapy can also be monitored as a decrease in 18F ﬂuorodeoxyglucose uptake within the aortic wall suggests improvement.400
Table 28 lists several key points concerning mycotic aneurysms.
B. Noninfectious Aortitis
TA and GCA, although rare, are the most common of a group of disorders that can be categorized as noninfectious aortitis (Table 29).394 A detailed discussion of the imaging features of each of these is beyond the scope of this document, but a brief discussion of TA and GCA follows.
TA is a rare, large-vessel vasculitis of unknown etiology, predominantly affecting young women (age < 40 years). The thoracic aorta and its major branches are most often affected,401 but the pulmonary arteries and abdominal aorta may also be affected. TA is characterized by a nonspeciﬁc inﬂammatory process that can progress to stenotic, even occlusive lesions secondary to intimal thickening.401,402 Progression of the disease can lead to destruction of the media, leading to aneurysm formation or rupture.
Digital subtraction angiography of the aorta and its branches, previously the gold standard, only provides information relating to luminal changes (ranging from smooth tapering stenosis to frank occlusion), which are a late feature. MRI, CT, and echocardiography can demonstrate homogeneous circumferential thickening of the aortic wall with a uniform smooth internal surface, which is different from the appearance of atherosclerosis403,404 but may be misdiagnosed as IMH. CT and MRI provide a more generalized survey of the aorta and its proximal branches than echocardiography, including the abdominal aorta and distal pulmonary arteries, which are sometimes affected.405 MRI may show arterial wall edema, a marker of active disease.406 In chronic TA, the aortic wall may become calciﬁed, which is best appreciated by CT. Positron emission tomography is a promising technique that may reveal the level of vascular inﬂammatory activity.407
GCA is a systemic panarteritis that characteristically affects middle-aged and elderly patients (age > 50 years).408,409

Although classically the temporal and/or other cranial arteries are involved, the aorta and its major branches are affected in approximately 10% to 18% of patients.410,411 Dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta are common and can lead to aortic dissection or rupture, usually several years after the initial diagnosis. If a diagnosis of extracranial GCA is suspected, echocardiography, CT, or MRI is recommended. The ﬁnding of a thickened aortic wall on CT or MRI indicates inﬂammation of the aortic wall (Figure 58) and thus active disease.412 Studies with positron emission tomography have suggested that subclinical aortic inﬂammation is often present in patients with GCA.413
IX. POSTSURGICAL IMAGING OF THE AORTIC ROOT AND AORTA
Advances in diagnostic imaging techniques have allowed earlier diagnosis of and more prompt surgical intervention for thoracic aortic disease, which in turn has likely improved outcomes for both emergency and elective surgery of the aorta. As a consequence increasing numbers of patients are presenting for follow-up care.
For both aortic dissections and aneurysms involving the ascending aorta, the surgeon usually replaces the ascending aorta with an interposition Dacron graft but leaves the native aortic root, arch, and descending aorta behind. Thus, survivors of the initial repair may remain at considerable risk for future aneurysmal dilatation and eventual rupture. Consequently, appropriate follow-up requires long-term clinical monitoring and follow-up imaging to detect such complications and to allow timely surgical or percutaneous reintervention. The foundation for such follow-up imaging is obtaining adequate baseline imaging that provides a reliable reference for future comparisons of aortic size and appearance. Moreover, baseline imaging will detect technical failures and improper or incomplete repairs with the potential for subsequent complications.
A. What the Imager Needs to Know
To evaluate postoperative ﬁndings accurately, the imaging physician must possess a general understanding of the surgical techniques available to treat thoracic aortic diseases and awareness of the details of the surgical procedure that was used in the individual patient. In most instances, the postoperative image may differ in important ways from that seen before the surgical intervention. It follows that the expected postoperative image and any possible variations as presented by the relevant imaging modality must be understood. Only then can the spectrum of potential postsurgical complications

be accurately recognized and distinguished from the expected postoperative appearance.
B. Common Aortic Surgical Techniques
Listed in Tables 30 and 31 are some of the more common aortic procedures and some of the alternative or less common procedures. A brief discussion of some of the more common procedures follows. The scope of this review does not permit detailed discussion of modiﬁcations of standard procedures or of less commonly used techniques.
1. Interposition Technique. This currently standard technique includes excision of the diseased segment of the native ascending aorta and its replacement with a polyester (Dacron) graft. The proximal anastomotic site is often supracoronary, and the distal anastomotic site is immediately proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. The anastomotic sites are often reinforced with externally placed circumferential strips of Teﬂon felt.
2. Inclusion Technique. The inclusion technique consists of an aortotomy, placement of an artiﬁcial graft within the diseased native aorta, and enclosing or ‘‘wrapping’’ the graft with the native aorta, which is sutured around the graft. This procedure creates a potential space between the graft and the native aortic wall, which has important imaging implications. The use of this technique has diminished signiﬁcantly because improved graft materials have led to decreased bleeding (this technique was used to provide a space into which leakage through grafts could occur to minimize extensive bleeding into the mediastinum).
3. Composite Grafts. A composite graft, or conduit, is a synthetic (commonly Dacron) aortic graft that includes a directly attached mechanical valve or bioprosthetic valve. With composite graft replacement, the coronary ostia are dissected from the native aorta with a rim of surrounding aorta (‘‘button technique’’), and each button is then reanastomosed individually to the composite graft.
4. Aortic Arch Grafts. For select patients with aortic arch involvement, open surgery may range from partial to complete arch replacement with or without debranching and reattachment of one or more of the arch vessels.
5. Elephant Trunk Procedure. Surgery for treatment of diffuse thoracic aortic disease is commonly performed in a two-stage operation. The ﬁrst stage consists of repair of the ascending aorta and aortic arch (with reconstruction of the great vessels); an extension of the aortic graft is inserted into the lumen of the proximal descending thoracic aorta,

170 Goldstein et al

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography February 2015

where it ﬂoats freely and is referred to as the ‘‘elephant trunk.’’ The second stage of the operation consists of repair of the descending aorta using the elephant trunk for the proximal anastomosis of an open surgical graft or as the proximal landing zone for an endovascular stent graft.
6. Cabrol Shunt Procedure. The Cabrol shunt procedure is an uncommon adjunct to the inclusion graft technique, performed to prevent progressive bleeding into the potential space between the graft and the native aortic wall, as described earlier. This procedure consists of a surgically created shunt between this potential space and the right atrium to alleviate any pressure in the perigraft space.
7. Technical Adjuncts. For all types of grafts, circumferential felt or pericardial rings are often used to buttress anastomoses. Felt pledgets are also used to reinforce the graft or the native aortic wall at sites of intraoperative cannula placement. These rings and pledgets have imaging implications for each of the imaging modalities, such as otherwise unexplained thickenings, reverberations, and acoustic shadowing.
A variety of adhesives, or biologic glues, have been used as an adjunct to standard methods of achieving anastomotic hemostasis (such as sutures and clips). These bioglues have also been used for reapproximating layers of the dissected aorta and for strengthening weakened aortic tissues by a ‘‘tanning’’ process. Although the value of these tissue adhesives is recognized, there are reports of tissue necrosis leading to false aneurysms.414 Moreover, these substances may produce edema, inﬂammation, and ﬁbrosis, leading to thickening of the aortic wall or adjacent tissues. Such thickening can be confused with leakage and hematoma by imaging techniques.

Many early postoperative CT studies show pleural or pericardial effusions, mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and/or left lobe atelectasis. These ﬁndings diminish in frequency over time and presumably represent normal postoperative ﬁndings without adverse clinical consequences.

C. Normal Postoperative Features
The details of the surgery that has been performed will determine the appearance of the ascending aorta on prospective imaging studies. There are only a few descriptions of the echocardiographic appearance of the ascending aorta after reconstruction. More information is available on computed tomographic and MRI ﬁndings. An aortic interposition graft is visualized as a thin, corrugated tube with an echodensity greater than that of the native aorta. There is usually an abrupt change between the graft and the native aorta as felt strips that are used to reinforce the anastomoses provide visual markers of those borders. Occasionally there is angulation of the aortic graft, especially near the anastomoses. These points of angulation are not clinically signiﬁcant but can mimic a dissection ﬂap, especially on axial computed tomographic images.
A small amount of perigraft thickening (<10 mm) is a common postoperative ﬁnding. This presumably results from minor leakage at the anastomotic suture lines created by needle holes. The uniform and concentric distribution of this thickening helps differentiate it from more serious leakage. Another mimicker of pathology can be seen at the site of coronary anastomoses. When the coronary arteries are resected with a rim of native aortic tissue (button technique), a focal bulge at this site can be misinterpreted as an incipient pseudoaneurysm. Importantly, the inclusion graft technique creates a potential space between the graft and its wrap, the native aorta. This space often contains ﬂuid and/or hematoma, which can be a normal ﬁnding with no clinical signiﬁcance, especially when <10 mm in thickness.
After repair of a type A dissection, a persistent dissection ﬂap is seen distal to the ascending aortic graft in 80% of patients.40 This persistence of a double-channel aorta after surgery is not considered a complication, provided it does not increase in size. In chronic dissections, the residual dissection ﬂap becomes thickened because of collagen deposition and becomes less oscillatory or even immobile.

D. Complications after Aortic Repair
Total removal of the diseased aortic segment is seldom possible with surgical repair of aortic lesions such as aneurysm and dissection, and the anastomoses between graft and native aorta are potential sites for late complications. Therefore, periodic postoperative surveillance by cardiovascular imaging specialists who are familiar with aortic diseases and surgical procedures cannot be overemphasized. Early detection of complications can facilitate optimal management, including reoperation when appropriate. Potential postoperative complications are listed in Table 32. An awareness of such complications, and the ability to differentiate them from the spectrum of ‘‘normal’’ postoperative ﬁndings, is obviously important. Some of the more common complications are discussed.
1. Pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysm is an important early or late complication that can occur after surgery for aneurysm dissection. In the vast majority of patients, pseudoaneurysm is not associated with any clinical symptoms.415 The silent nature of these potentially life-threatening complications emphasizes the need for surveillance imaging. Pseudoaneurysms usually occur at anastomoses. Although they can form at the site of needle holes even when the suture lines are intact, more often they originate from partial dehiscence of the proximal or distal suture lines or at the site of coronary reimplantation. The size of the pseudoaneurysm, its change over time, and the patient’s symptoms and clinical status will determine management. Small, sterile pseudoaneurysms can remain stable for years without further intervention. Pseudoaneurysms are readily detectable by both CT and MRI. TEE is also reliable for detecting pseudoaneurysms of the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta but can miss lesions in the distal ascending aorta because of the interposition of the trachea.
2. False Luminal Dilatation. Surgery for type A aortic dissection is usually limited to the ascending aorta. Distal to the ascending aortic

graft, a dissection ﬂap and a false lumen with demonstrable blood ﬂow are present in approximately 80% of patients.40 Strictly speaking, this is not a complication, but there is a potential for false luminal expansion. Typically, the median diameter of the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta are all mildly enlarged after type A aortic dissection repair.416 Although expansion rates are low, progressive dilatation of the patent false lumen, facilitated by the poor condition of the weakened and thinned wall, often occurs. This may result in late aortic rupture or collapse of the true lumen. In the minority of patients, the false lumen can become thrombosed. Although the inﬂuence of thrombosis of the false lumen on long-term survival remains speculative, it may be associated with improved survival.
3. Involvement of Aortic Branches. Extension of a dissection ﬂap and/or IMH into an aortic branch may result in luminal narrowing or total obstruction. In addition, dilatation of a patent false lumen and associated collapse of the true lumen may also affect the branch vessels. These complications may occur in the coronary arteries, supra-aortic vessels, or visceral vessels.
4. Infection. Early- or late-onset infection complicates prosthetic aortic graft insertion in 0.5% to 5% of patients. CT is considered the standard imaging method for aortic graft infection.417 The role of TEE for detection for graft infection has not been thoroughly investigated.
E. Recommendations for Serial Imaging Techniques and Schedules
The imaging modality of choice for evaluating the postoperative aorta has not been clearly determined. Both CT and MRI are reasonable choices. These techniques provide precise and reproducible measurements of the native aorta diameter at any level and have the advantage compared with TEE of including the supra-aortic and visceral vessels in a single examination and providing reproducible landmarks for comparing images from serial studies.
We consider contrast-enhanced CT to be the optimal diagnostic tool for follow-up of patients after surgery for aortic disease. MRI is also valuable for serial follow-up because image resolution is comparable with that of CT. In some patients, MRI may be preferred because neither radiation nor contrast media are required. This is especially true in young patients (e.g., those with Marfan syndrome) because the radiation exposure from serial examinations may be considerable.
TTE, although a routine study for many cardiology patients, is limited in its utility to follow patients after aortic surgery. TTE provides an adequate assessment of the aortic valve, aortic root, and proximal ascending aorta but is limited in its ability to image the remainder of the thoracic aorta.
TEE has some advantages over CT and MRI. It is portable, provides excellent images of the aortic root, can precisely assess the morphology and function of the aortic valve, and provides information on left ventricular function. However, it may not be able to image the distal ascending aorta (which may be the site of the aortic graft’s distal anastomosis), the proximal aortic arch, the proximal aortic arch vessels, and the distal abdominal aorta. Moreover, it cannot assess the relationship of aortic pseudoaneurysms to adjacent anatomic structures such as the lung or mediastinum. Last, TEE is semi-invasive, which is a drawback for serial, repeated examinations.
The plan for follow-up surveillance imaging should not be left to other practitioners alone. Primary responsibility lie with the aortic

specialist (cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, or vascular surgeon) overseeing the evaluation and management of the patient. Ideally, there should be a computer database into which the relevant clinical, surgical, and imaging details of every patient with thoracic aortic disease are entered. The surveillance imaging modality and the frequency of follow-up should be decided on the basis of the individual patient’s clinical history, prior intervention, and rate of progression of the disease, outlined in Table 5. In general, patients with small aortas or mild disease can be followed at less frequent intervals than are those with larger aortas. Although it is reasonable to permit surveillance imaging examinations to be performed at sites close to the patient’s home, ideally the images should be reviewed and the patient followed by a provider or center with expertise and experience in the management of thoracic aortic disease.
X. SUMMARY
In conclusion, the considerable advances in diagnostic imaging techniques have greatly increased our understanding of thoracic aortic diseases. The availability, cost/beneﬁt ratio, and additive value of each technique determine its indications. TTE continues to be the technique most used in clinical practice for aortic root assessment. CT has the advantage of its high-resolution assessment of the entire aorta and excellent accuracy on size measurements. MRI offers the greatest morphologic and dynamic information of the aorta without radiation, although in clinical practice it is less commonly available.
New advances such as time-resolved 3D phase-contrast velocity (four-dimensional ﬂow) on MRI, electrocardiographically gated MDCT, and the use of contrast in echocardiographic studies, will permit further improvement in the deﬁnition of biomechanical properties of the diseased aorta wall, which can be expected to inﬂuence the prognostication and management of patients with aortic diseases.
