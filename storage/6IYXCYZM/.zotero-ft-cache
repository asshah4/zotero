Viscosity of mixtures of sickle and normal red cells at varying hematocrit levels
Implications for transfusion

Viscosity ( 7 )in a blood suspension is affected by the total hematocrit level (HT)as well as by the deformability of the cells. The impact of these combined factors on the rheologic
behavior of sickle cell suspensions and on guidelines for transfusion has not been explored fully. Therefore, the 7 of mixtures of washed normal (AA) and sickle (SS) red cells was determined in a rotational viscosimeter as a function of the hematocrit level of SS cells (Hs),HT,oxygen tension (P02), and shear rate. The ratio H T :c~an be taken as an index of potential oxygen delivery. The optimal HT(for maximum H T : ~b)ecame progressively higher as the Hs or the H~:HTratio was lowered; at a given HT, H T :r~ose with a
decrease in Hs, especially at low Hs values. These data support the concept that simple transfusion alone is not as beneficial to the patient as exchange transfusion and that substantial benefit can be obtained by bringing the patient to very low Hs levels. The
finding that 9 rose with HT more steeply when the H ~ : H Tratio rather than Hs was held constant suggested that the absolute level of Hs may be more useful than the H ~ : HrTatio as a guide for a transfusion regimen. TRANSFUSION 1987;27:228-233.

PATIENTwSith sickle cell anemia frequently receive transfusions to reverse or prevent some of the more severe complications of the disease, such as stroke or priapism. It is generally recognized, however, that transfusion can lead to an increase in blood viscosity, which may cause a worsening of existing infarctions or the initiation of new ones.'p2 The safest method of transfusing a patient has not been established clearly.
A ceiling of 35 percent for total hematocrit level (HT) is generally accepted, but higher HT values are occa-
sionally achieved, whether deliberately or inadvert e n t l ~ .T~h?e~percentage of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) is limited by some transfusion programs to levels as low as 25 p e r ~ e n t w, ~hereas others allow up to 50 percent.2 Lessin et a1.6 and Anderson et al.' showed that blood viscosity increases with an increasing percentage of sickle cells (SS cells), but their analyses did
not address the question of rising HT.Jan et al.' showed that transfusion to an HT above 35 percent
caused an increase in blood viscosity sufficient to diminish the venous PO2 level, but they did not correlate their data with the relative percentage of SS cells.

Our study was conducted to obtain a more complete profile of the rheologic behavior of mixtures of SS and normal (AA) red cells in different proportions and over a range of HT, with the ultimate aim of determining the optimal conditions that can be attained by the transfusion of patients with sickle cell disease.
Materials and Methods
Blood was taken from children who weighed more than 30 kg and were not chronically ill other than sickle cell disease. At least 6 weeks had elapsed from any previous crisis and 3 months from any transfusion. Informed consent was obtained from both the parent and the patient. The children were homozygous for the sickle gene; none had detectable hemoglobin A on electrophoresis, and A2 levels were all less than 3.5 percent. The fetal hemoglobin level was less than 15 percent. Patients with mean corpuscular volume less than 80 pm3 or greater than 100 pm3 were excluded. AA blood was obtained from healthy adults.
The hematocrit level was determined by centrifugation at 15,000 X g for 5 minutes. The red cell counts were determined in a standard hemocytometer, and the mean corpuscular volume was taken from the ratio of hematocrit to red cells. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed on cellulose acetate at a pH value of 8.4 (Helena Laboratories,
Beaumont, TX), and hemoglobin S was confirmed by
metabisulfite sickle preparation. Fetal hemoglobin levels were measured by a modification of the alkali denaturation technique of Singer et a1.8 The hemoglobin A2 level was assayed after separation on a commercially available column (Helena Laboratories).
The red cells in blood samples were washed three times and resuspended in a buffer solution containing 0.69 g per

dl NaCl, 0.227 g per dl NaHC03, 0.037 g per dl KCl, and 0.5 g per dl bovine serum albumin, with pH brought to 7.4 by bubbling gas containing 20 percent 0 2 and 5.6 percent C02 for approximately 30 minutes. Each experiment was
performed at a given ratio of SS to AA cells, at two oxygen
tensions, and over a range of HTfrom 20 to 45 percent. The washed S S and AA cells were mixed to the desired ratio of the hematocrit level of SS cells (Hs) to HT. The suspension was then divided into two aliquots for adjustment of HTto 20 and 45 percent. The cells were not fully oxygenated when the hematocrit measurement was made; however, we have found that the hematocrit values of venous blood samples remained stable (within 0.3%) during progressive oxygenation. Each of the two aliquots was further divided into two parts, one to be brought to a PO2 value of more than 100 torr, and the other to 37 f 1 torr. The adjustment of oxygen tension was performed in a rotary tonometer, using N2 containing 5.6 percent C 0 2 with or without 20 percent 02. The pH of the suspensions remained at 7.4. For each oxygenation state, the sample with HT= 20 percent and the sample with HT = 45 percent were mixed in various proportions without exposure to air to obtain samples with a range of HT, all at the same PO2 value and with the desired SS:AA ratio. Measurements of viscosity of the cell suspensions were made in a coaxial cylinder viscosimeter at shear rates of 0.52 to 208 sec-’. Light microscopic examination of the suspensions showed no cellular aggregation.

Results
At a constant H ~ : H Tratio, the viscosity of oxygenated suspensions at a given shear rate (y) rose with HT. The rise
of viscosity with HTat y = 208 sec-’ was greatest for the
pure S S cell suspension (the uppermost curve in Fig. 1, top) and least for the pure AA cell suspension (the lowest curve in Fig. 1, top). Accordingly, when SS cells were mixed with AA cells, the viscosity fell between these limits. Deoxygenation to a PO2 of 37 torr elevated the viscosity curves for suspensions containing SS cells, especially at high HT(Fig. 1, bottom). A cross-plot of viscosity (at PO2 = 37 torr) against Hs:HT ratios at various levels of HT showed an approximately linear relationship at each HT (Fig. 2); the slope of the curve became steeper with rising

HT. The rise in viscosity with H ~ : H Tratio at a constant HT is attributable to the increasing number of the less deformable SS cells. From the least-squares regression line obtained from the data points in Figure 2, we can also plot the viscosity against HT, holding Hs constant (Fig. 3). These curves reflect the rise in viscosity resulting from the addition of AA cells to a fixed Hs.
The viscosity of deoxygenated cell suspensions measured at lower shear rates also rose with increased H ~ : H Tratio (Fig. 4); the viscosity values were higher and the slopes steeper than at the higher shear rates. With the reduction in shear rate, the deoxygenated suspension of SS cells increased its viscosity less than the AA preparation did: at
HT=45 percent, the ratio of the viscositiesof SS to AA cell suspensions was 2.20 at 4= 208 sec-' and 1.82 at 5.2 sec-I.
The relative effectiveness of a sample of blood in delivering oxygen can be estimated from the ratio of hematocrit value to viscosity (HT:~)).'For AA cells, the H T :v~ersus HT plots at various shear rates showed that H T :w~as lower and the change with HT more marked at lower shear rates (Fig. 5, top). The maximum point of the curve, which reflects the
optimal HTfor oxygen delivery, occurred at a lower HTfor
the lower shear rates. In comparison to the results on AA cells, for S S cells the curves were lower, showed less variation with shear rate, and had a lower optimal HT

(Fig. 5, bottom). The H T :r~atio of mixtures of SS and AA cells at a PO2 of 37 torr and a shear rate of 208 sec-I were plotted against HTfor a family of H ~ : H T(Fig. 6,top) and
HS (Fig.6,bottom)values. The AA cell suspensions(Hs:HT and Hs =0) showed a broad maximum at HT130 percent. As H ~ : H Tor Hs increased,the height of this maximal H T : ~ ratio was reduced and the fall of H T :v~alues with rising HT became steeper.In Figure 7, the diminishingeffect of Hs on

percent is indicated by the dashed line. To match this HT
level, a suspension with an HT of 45 percent must contain
less than 10 percent Hs. The shape of the curves indicates that the maximal rate of improvement of H T :r~atio occurs
when the Hs becomes very low.

viscosimeter is probably relevant to the situation in the microcirculation.
The current study was performed on suspensionsof red cells in Ringer's solution rather than in plasma, the suspending medium in vivo, in order to focus on the roles of red cell deformability and hematocrit level by eliminating the effects of variations in plasma viscosity and plasma-induced red cell aggregation among the blood samples.IOThe general conclusions attained in the current study, however, should still be applicable to considerations of blood viscosity, especially at high shear rates when rouleaux are dispersed.

The viscosity of a cell suspension is determined by the concentration of cells, the deformability and aggregation of those cells, and the viscosity of the suspending medium.'O These factors govern the rheologic behavior of blood flow, not only in the large vessels but also in the microcirculation, which is the principal site of circulatory disturbance in sickle cell disease. The hematocrit value and the viscosity in the microcirculation are both lower than in the larger vessels, but the relationship of the hematocrit level to viscosity in 20- to 30-pm arterioles is the same as that measured in a rotational viscosimeter.'I It has been shown that in artificial tubes varying from 30 to 200 pm in diameter the HT:q ratio for hardened cells relative to normal cells does not change.'* Thus, comparison of SS to AA cells in terms of the relationship of HT to the viscosity measured in the

patients with sickle cell disease has been reported to range between 25 and 45 torr;' in particular capillaries this value could fall even lower. Whatever the actual PO2 level in the microcirculation, the trends of the relationship of viscosity to HT, Hs, and the H ~ : H T ratio described here will probably apply.
At full oxygenation, the viscosity of SS cell suspensions is already higher than that of AA cell suspensions." In addition, the effect of deoxygenation on the rheologic behavior of blood should be considered even on the arterial side of the microcirculation. The arterial PO2 level in the patient with sickle cell disease is usually approximately 85 torr, which is less than that in the person with normal cells." At such PO2 levels, polymerization of hemoglobin S can be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in cells with high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration~.T'~he release of oxygen from red cells occurs

already in the arterioles,I6especiallywhen the tissue is

relatively hypoxic. Thus, the red cells that enter the

' 1 capillary bed, where the need for deformability is

greatest, may be less fully oxygenated than estimated

from arterial oxygen measurements, and hence the

viscosity of the blood may be correspondingly higher.

If there is stasis, there would be even greater deoxy-

genation and polymerization before the cells enter

the narrowest part of the circulation.

constant HT. In experiments with mixtures of normal AA cells and AA cells hardened with glutaraldehyde, Carr and Cokelet'' also found a rise in viscosity with an increase in the proportion of hardened cells, but the relationship was not linear. The difference between the findings of the two studies may be related to the difference in the degree of cell rigidity: the deoxygenated sickle cells in the current investigation are still somewhat deformable, whereas the glutaraldehydehardened cells studied by Carr and Cokelett9 were not deformable.
Shear rates in the microcirculation are normally considerably higher than 1000 sec-I, and the wall shear stress is on the order of 20 to 60 dynes per cm2.11 Above a i, value of 100 sec-I, neither normal nor sickle cells show any further decreases in viscosity in a viscosimeter, suggesting that a shear stress of approximately 5 dynes per cm2has induced maximal deformation in the cell under these circumstances. At a i, value of 208 sec-I, the relative behavior of sickle and normal cells is similar to that obtained under the shear conditions found in the microcirculation. That measurement is therefore relevant to the physiologic conditions. Our data (Fig. 5 ) agree with previous observations that the viscosity of suspensions of hardened normal cellsi3 and deoxygenated sickle cells20does not alter with shear rate as much as it does in normal cells because the harder cells do not change shape easily in response to increasing stress to facilitate fluid motion. As illustrated by Figures 4 and 5, the difference between the viscosities of AA and SS cell suspensions diminishes at lower shear rates. In stasis, where the flow and thus the shear rate is lower, the detrimental rheologic aspects of increasing HT, even with AA cells, may be magnified.
When a patient receives a simple transfusion, the increase in HT with a constant Hs leads to a rise in viscosity, which limits the improvement of oxygen delivery despite the increased oxygen carrying capacity. If the patient receives an exchange transfusion with HT held constant, the fall in Hs will lead to a decrease in viscosity and an improvement in oxygen delivery. The relative advantage of the two types of transfusion can be analyzed by using the curves for HT:v (Fig. 6, bottom) to illustrate a hypothetical patient. In Figure 6, bottom, the data point S represents a patient with sickle cell disease with HT= HS= 20 percent before transfusion treatment. After simple transfusion to raise the HT to 35 percent, the data point moves along the same HT:v curve (Hs = 20%)to point T, and there is a drop of about 11 percent in oxygen delivery (HT:v). However, if an exchange transfusion is carried out to lower the Hs level of the patient to 5 percent, although the HT is raised to 35 percent with AA cells, the result would be at point E,

where the HT:v ratio is 11 percent greater than at point S and about 23 percent greater than at point T.
An exchange transfusion uses more blood than a simple transfusion. To raise the patient from point S to point T by simple transfusion would require approximately 20 ml per kg of packed cells. An exchange transfusion to bring the patient closer to point E would require 80 ml per kg or more of whole blood, usually incurring exposure to more donors. Iron load would be less with this technique, since a balancing amount of blood is removed. However, the chance of infection or alloimmunization, serious concerns in transfusion, would be increased. Clearly, risk factors should be weighed in planning any therapeutic procedure.
The clinical guidelines for transfusion should be developed considering not only the Hs:HT ratio but also the absolute levels of Hs and HT. Since viscosity varies less with HT when Hs rather than the Hs:HT ratio is held constant, as shown by comparing Figures 1 and 3, Hs provides a more useful point of reference than the more commonly used Hs:HT ratio. Transfusion programs that prescribe a maximum HT of 35 percent and a maximum Hs:HT ratio of 30 percent, would translate to a maximum Hs of 10.5 percent. Allowing the HT to rise to 40 percent by simple transfusion would cause the Hs:HT ratio to fall, but the viscosity would increase and the rheologic aspects would become less favorable. The results of the current study suggest that Hs should be decreased concomitantly to maximize the effectiveness of oxygen transport.
