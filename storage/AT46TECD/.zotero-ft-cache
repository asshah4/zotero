Abstract 
The electrophysiological responses of CA1 pyramidal neurons to 5 min forebrain ischemia were studied with intracellular recording and staining techniques in vivo. The baseline membrane potential rapidly depolarized to approximately −20 mV about 3 min after the onset of ischemia and began to repolarize 1–3 min after recirculation. The amplitude of this ischemic depolarization (ID) was related directly to the severity of ischemia and its latency of onset was inversely related to brain temperature. Spontaneous synaptic activity ceased shortly after ischemia onset while the evoke synaptic potentials lasted until shortly before the onset of ID. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) disappeared earlier than excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the membrane input resistance of CA1 neurons increased after the onset of ischemia.

Abstract 
The present study addresses mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor effects on hippocampal neuron viability after experimental traumatic brain injury. Rats were pretreated for 48 h with vehicle, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone, or the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone (RU486) and subsequently subjected to sham operation or unilateral controlled cortical impact injury. To determine the effects of receptor antagonist pretreatments on cell survival, neurons in regions CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation were counted 24 h post-injury using the optical fractionator method. Injury decreased the number of viable neurons in CA1 and CA3 of vehicle-pretreated animals. Notably, this cell loss was prevented in CA1 by RU486 pretreatment. Neuronal loss was also observed in dentate gyrus. The effects of receptor blockade and injury on the expression of viability-related genes were also assessed by comparing relative bcl-2 , bax , and p53 messenger RNA levels using in situ hybridization analysis. Spironolactone and RU486 decreased basal bcl-2 messenger RNA levels in CA1 and dentate gyrus but did not affect basal bax or p53 levels. Injury decreased bcl-2 messenger RNA levels in dentate gyrus but did not affect bax or p53 levels in vehicle-pretreated animals. 
 
These data demonstrate that RU486 pretreatment prevents the loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons 24 h after traumatic brain injury. RU486 modulation of bcl-2 , bax , or p53 messenger RNA expression does not predict neuronal viability at this time point, suggesting that RU486-mediated preservation of CA1 neurons does not involve transcriptional regulation of these cell death-related genes.

Abstract 
Four cholinesterase inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Here we review our experiences with two cholinesterase inhibitors (metrifonate and galanthamine) and a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (CI-1017) in behavioral pharmacological and brain slice experiments in aging and young rabbits. Aging rabbits are impaired in their ability to acquire the hippocampus-dependent trace eyeblink conditioning task, as compared to young controls. A large proportion of aging animals cannot reach behavioral criterion in this task. Those that do learn, do so more slowly. In addition, the post-burst afterhyperpolarization and spike frequency accommodation is increased in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from aging animals, i.e., cellular excitability is reduced as compared to those from young animals. Metrifonate, galanthamine, and CI-1017 reduced the learning deficits observed in aging rabbits so that they learned almost as quickly as young controls. These cholinergic compounds also enhanced the postsynaptic excitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro. Therefore, we propose that the amelioration of learning impairment with the cholinergic compounds may in part be due to the enhanced excitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The potential relevance of our studies to further understanding the cellular and behavioral changes that occur with normal aging and Alzheimer’s Disease is discussed.

Abstract 
The rapid electrophysiological effects of 17β-estradiol on CA1 pyramidal neurons(n = 86) were investigated utilizing intracellular recording from the rat hippocampal slice preparation. Bath application of 17β-estradiol, but not 17α-estradiol, caused a reversible depolarization and increased input resistance with a latency of less than 1 min in 19.8% of CA1 neurons tested. There was no significant difference in the percentage of estradiol-responsive cells between male and female rats. Estradiol-responsive cells were identified from prepubertal female rats, as well as females in all stages of the estrous cycle. 17β-estradiol had no effect on the slow afterhyperpolarization or accommodative properties of CA1 neurons. In 2 out of 4 cells tested, the specific antiestrogen, tamoxifen, blocked the excitatory response to 17β-estradiol.

Abstract 
To determine whether hippocampal pyramidal neurons retain authentic functional properties in mature organotypic culture, hippocampal slice cultures were established from young adult rats (P20–21). Cultures maintained 7 days in vitro retained tight organization of neuronal layers, as opposed to the widening restructure of pyramidal neurons often observed in perinatal slices. CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons fired action potentials in response to current injection and exhibited spontaneous and evoked synaptic currents, indicating intact neuronal function and normal hippocampal neural circuitry. We also tested neuronal sensitivity of slice cultures to ischemic injury. Acute ischemic paradigm resulted in selective death of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region, which was prevented by treatment with an NMDA-antagonist, MK-801. Robust efflux of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was detected during ischemia, consistent with changes shown in acute slices. In summary, hippocampal organotypic cultures prepared from young adult rats maintained neuronal architecture and synaptic activity in vitro and can be used in parallel with an acute slice system to model mature brain tissue to examine ischemic pathophysiology and neuroprotective treatment.

Abstract 
Neuroscientists have long been fascinated by the problem of how memory is formed, stored, and recalled. Cellular models of learning and memory propose that morphological remodeling of existing synapses and the formation of new ones lead to enduring changes in neuronal networks. We discuss the evidence of activity-dependent structural plasticity of dendritic spines in the hippocampus, focusing on the effects of environmental enrichment, behavioral learning, and in vitro manipulations of neuronal activity leading to synaptic plasticity. We review the actions of neurotrophins and hormones on dendritic spines in the context of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Finally, we discuss the consequences of abnormal dendritic spines for cognition and learning and memory in disorders associated with mental retardation.

Abstract 
In refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, the hippocampal formation seems pivotal in the development of epileptogenesis. Hippocampal neurons are highly vulnerable to excitotoxicity and hypoxia, and the hippocampus often becomes the source of refractory seizures. Recurrent hippocampal seizures also lead to neuronal loss. As neurons die, there is a deafferentation of their synaptic targets, which in turn appears to trigger a structural reorganization that results in re-enervation of those postsynaptic neurons. Although the initial ‘rationale’ for the rewiring of this circuitry might be viewed as homeostatic, morphological plasticity seems to permanently increase the excitatory nature of the hippocampal circuitry, especially after several repeated seizures. These alterations increase susceptibility to later recurrent seizures – i.e., mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis.

Abstract 
CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) provide a major output of the hippocampus proper. They integrate information arriving directly from the entorhinal cortex via the temporoammonic pathway, and indirectly via the polysynaptic dentate gyrus–CA3–CA1 loop. Both pathways terminate in a spatially segregated manner onto CA1 PC apical dendrites. The temporoammonic pathway targets the distal dendrites in the stratum lacunosum moleculare, while CA3 PC axons terminate within the stratum radiatum. These inputs are integrated in the somatodendritic compartment and converted to an output consisting of action potentials propagating along the CA1 axons, a process controlled by the intrinsic membrane properties of CA1 neurons. We will first consider the mechanisms determining input–output properties of normal CA1 PCs. We will then address how the properties of CA1 PCs change in acute and chronic epilepsy models, and how they might contribute to increased excitability.

Abstract 
This article reviews some of the conceptual and clinical issues in the study of recovery from brain injury. Until only a few decades ago, professional opinion held that once damage occurs in the adult brain, little, if any, structural or functional recovery was possible. This pessimistic view slowed the development of research and practice in the treatment and rehabilitation of the brain-injured patients. Research shows that even in the adult brain, dramatic reorganization and repair can occur under the right conditions. These conditions, and interventions to promote recovery, are discussed here.

Abstract 
 
The adult brain is extremely vulnerable to various insults. The recent discovery of neural progenitors in adult mammals, however, raises the possibility of repairing damaged tissue by recruiting their latent regenerative potential. Here we show that activation of endogenous progenitors leads to massive regeneration of hippocampal pyramidal neurons after ischemic brain injury. Endogenous progenitors proliferate in response to ischemia and subsequently migrate into the hippocampus to regenerate new neurons. Intraventricular infusion of growth factors markedly augments these responses, thereby increasing the number of newborn neurons. Our studies suggest that regenerated neurons are integrated into the existing brain circuitry and contribute to ameliorating neurological deficits. These results expand the possibility of novel neuronal cell regeneration therapies for stroke and other neurological diseases.

Introduction 
In adult tissues with high regenerative capacity, such as skin and liver, dead cells are replaced either by the proliferation of nearby cells or resident stem cells. Unlike such cases, it has long been believed that the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is incapable of significant self-repair or regeneration (Björklund and Lindvall, 2000) . Many lines of recent evidence have revealed, however, that progenitors with the ability to produce new neurons and glia remain in the adult CNS. In particular, neural stem cells defined with the characteristics of long-term self-renewal and multipotentiality have been shown to persist throughout life in various mammalian species including humans (Temple, 2001) . The adult CNS also contains a range of progenitors with more limited capacities of growth and differentiation (Temple, 2001) (herein collectively called neural progenitors). Although these adult progenitors are known to be abundant in the periventricular areas, recent studies have revealed their widespread occurrence in the parenchyma of various CNS regions (Palmer et al. 1999) , (Yamamoto et al. 2001a) and (Yamamoto et al. 2001b) . 
 
Consistent with these findings, continuous generation of new neurons has been detected in the adult (Temple 2001) and (Gould and Gross 2002) . Although such persistent neurogenesis had originally been thought to occur in only a few restricted areas, more recent studies have demonstrated the production of new neurons in many other CNS regions (Rietze et al. 2000) , (Pencea et al. 2001) and (Gould and Gross 2002) . Furthermore, it has been shown that various insults stimulate the proliferation of endogenous progenitors either in known neurogenic sites (Gould and Tanapat 1997) , (Liu et al. 1998) , (Fallon et al. 2000) , (Magavi et al. 2000) , (Jin et al. 2001) and (Yoshimura et al. 2001) or in regions where neurogenesis normally does not occur (Johansson et al. 1999) , (Yamamoto et al. 2001a) and (Yamamoto et al. 2001b) . In adult songbirds, however, induced death of neurons that normally turn over results in compensatory replacement of the same neuronal subtype, whereas normally nonreplaced types cannot be regenerated (Scharff et al., 2000) . Thus, such a limitation in adult neurogenesis has been considered to be attributable to the lack of substantial regeneration after damage. 
 
Current efforts toward curing various neurological diseases have mainly aimed at preventing neuronal cell death (Björklund and Lindvall 2000) and (Horner and Gage 2000) . The above accumulating evidence, however, raises the alternative possibility that if dormant capacities of endogenous progenitors could be activated by certain manipulations, they may be recruited to generate new functional neurons and repair the damaged CNS. Although some recent studies have begun to address such an idea, regeneration of new neurons has been observed only at a very low frequency (Magavi et al., 2000) or not distinguished from simply the survival of existing neurons (Fallon et al. 2000) and (Yoshimura et al. 2001) . Thus, the therapeutic values of the neuronal replacement strategies have not yet been evaluated intensively. 
 
Here we sought to augment the regenerative capacity of endogenous progenitors upon focusing on the hippocampus. The adult hippocampus, a vital center for learning and memory, is extremely vulnerable to various insults such as ischemia. Although the hippocampus is known as an active neurogenic site, only one neuronal subtype, granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG), are continuously generated, and the production of new neurons in other hippocampal regions appears to be very limited in the adult (Rietze et al., 2000) . We show here that following ischemic brain injury, adult neural progenitors can be stimulated in situ by intraventricular infusion of growth factors to replace CA1 pyramidal neurons. These newly generated CA1 neurons form functional synapses and are integrated into the existing brain circuitry. In parallel to the massive induction of new hippocampal neurons, the growth factor treatment ameliorates deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial cognitive functions in ischemic animals.

Degeneration and Recovery of Hippocampal Neurons Following Ischemia 
 
Transient ischemia of the forebrain in rodents causes selective degeneration of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (Kirino 1982) , (Pulsinelli et al. 1982) and (Smith et al. 1984) . It remained unknown, however, whether regeneration of pyramidal neurons occurs late after ischemia. To address this issue, we have recently established a rat model in which CA1 neurons can be eliminated in a highly reproducible manner, yet leaves animals able to survive severe ischemic damage. 
 
A notable feature of this animal model is delayed, extensive loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal part of the hippocampus. Immunostaining for NeuN, a marker for mature neurons, detected gradual loss of CA1 neurons 2 to 4 days after ischemia (DAI2-4). During this initial period, most of the CA1 pyramidal neurons expressed apoptosis-inducing activated caspase-3 (data not shown) and became TUNEL + (Figure 1L) . Consequently, cells with pyknotic morphology occupied the degenerated CA1 ( Figure 1G , arrow), and only a very few neurons remained at DAI7 (compare Figures 1B and 1B ′ with 1A and 1A′, and see Figure 2B ; 4 ± 1 NeuN + cells and 2 ± 1 cresyl violet-stained cells compared to 313 ± 24 and 370 ± 23 cells, respectively, in intact animals in the defined 0.15 mm 2 area; see Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure S1 at http://www.cell.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/cgi/content/full/110/4/429/DC1 ; mean ± SD, n = 6 animals, total 12 hemispheres). The extensive loss of pyramidal neurons was also evident at DAI14 (Figure 2B) .

Despite such an extensive neuronal loss in the initial 2 weeks, we detected a small but significantly higher number of NeuN + cells at DAI28 ( Figures 1C, 1C ′, and 2B; 32 ± 7 cells, p < 0.01 in unpaired two-tailed t test). These cells were sparsely distributed within the destructed pyramidal layer and surrounded by the remnant of dead cells and gliotic fibers ( Figure 1H , arrowhead). Their morphological features such as large nucleus, discrete nucleolus, and the size of their soma (diameter, 15.7 ± 2.6 μm in 4-μm-thick paraffin sections, total 183 cells examined, n = 4 animals) were reminiscent of intact pyramidal neurons (diameter, 16.5 ± 1.9 μm). Many of these neurons still survived 2 months after ischemia. Notably, β-tubulin type III + (TuJ1 + ) and Hu + immature neurons, which are rarely detectable in normal adult animals, emerged after ischemia (Figure 2B) . 
 
The ischemia-induced loss and subsequent recovery of neurons were also detected in other regions of the hippocampus (see Supplemental Figure S1 at http://www.cell.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/cgi/content/full/110/4/429/DC1 ). The neuronal loss caused by global ischemia is generally less severe in the ventrolateral part of the hippocampus than in the dorsomedial part (Pulsinelli et al. 1982) and (Smith et al. 1984) . However, we reproducibly observed significantly higher numbers of neurons at DAI28 than at DAI7 irrespective of the anteroposterior and dorsoventral positions of the hippocampus. 
Enhanced Recovery of Hippocampal Neurons by Growth Factor Treatment 
 
Ischemia has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of neural progenitors in the DG, which leads to increased production of new granule cells (Liu et al. 1998) , (Jin et al. 2001) and (Yoshimura et al. 2001) . Thus, the generation of new neurons from endogenous progenitors could also occur in the CA1 pyramidal layer. If endogenous progenitors contribute to production of new neurons, expansion of their endogenous pool could augment their regenerative capacity. 
 
To test this idea, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which act as mitogens for adult progenitors (Craig et al. 1996) and (Kuhn et al. 1997) , were infused into the lateral ventricle by using osmotic minipumps from DAI2 to DAI5. Even after growth factor infusion, CA1 pyramidal neurons were progressively degenerated in the initial week ( Figures 1D, 1D ′, and 1I), and most of the cells became TUNEL + (Figure 1M) . Consequently, the extent of neuronal loss was indistinguishable at DAI7 between treated and untreated animals (Figure 2C) . Although a very few cells remained scattered among debris of dead cells (Figure 1I) , electron microscopic analyses revealed that they exhibited destructed morphologies with broken cell membrane and nuclei ( Figure 1O , arrowheads; [Kirino and Sano 1984] and [Colbourne et al. 1999b] ). Thus, neither FGF-2 nor EGF exhibited substantial neuroprotective effects on dying neurons. 
 
Nevertheless, the number of neurons detected late after ischemia was dramatically increased by the treatment ( Figures 1E, 1E ′, and 1J). At DAI28, FGF-2 and EGF increased the numbers of NeuN + and cresyl violet-stained CA1 neurons 4.2-fold and 9.2-fold, respectively ( Figure 2C ; 134 ± 72 NeuN + and 101 ± 54 cresyl violet-stained cells, p < 0.01, n = 6 animals). Thus, the treatment led to 40% recovery of the total number of NeuN + cells lost by ischemia. Infusion of the vehicle solution alone did not cause such recovery. 
 
These neurons were clustered along the original pyramidal layer and exhibited morphology highly reminiscent of intact pyramidal neurons ( Figures 1J and 1P , arrowheads). They also expressed SCIP, a transcription factor expressed in adult CA1 neurons (Figures 1K and 1N) . Many of these neurons survived for at least up to 6 months after ischemia (68 ± 9 NeuN + and 59 ± 16 cresyl violet-stained cells at DAI180-194, n = 2 animals, 4 hemispheres). We noticed slight enlargement of the ventricular lumen and deformity of the shape of the hippocampus in growth factor-treated animals (Figures 1D and 1E) . However, significantly higher numbers of CA1 pyramidal neurons were detectable all along the anteroposterior axis of the hippocampus in the treated animals than in the untreated animals. These results suggest that growth factors induce substantial regeneration of hippocampal neurons after ischemia. In the following sections, we provide several lines of evidence supporting such an idea.

To examine whether neurons detected after ischemia were produced by endogenous progenitors, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which selectively labels proliferative cells in vivo, was administered between DAI2 and DAI4. During DAI2-7, few BrdU + cells coexpressed neuronal markers, indicating that the labeling method used here did not detect repair reactions of damaged DNA (data not shown). At DAI28, however, many BrdU + cells were detected in the CA1, and some of them expressed the neuronal marker NeuN in both untreated (Figure 3A) and growth factor-treated (Figure 3B) animals. Some BrdU + cells also expressed TuJ1 and Hu (Figures 3C and 3D) . Coexpression of these markers with BrdU in single cells was confirmed by three-dimensional digital reconstruction of the confocal images ( Figure 3B ′). In the above experiments, BrdU was administered for 2 days (DAI2-4), and hence labeled only a fraction of dividing progenitors. Nevertheless, 46% (412/890) of NeuN + neurons detected in the growth factor-treated animals were labeled with BrdU. Such double-labeled cells were also detectable in other hippocampal regions, and also outside the hippocampus including the temporal cortex ( Figures 3E and 3E ′).

The above analyses revealed marked effects of growth factors on the production of new neurons. The number of BrdU + cells detected in the CA1 was increased about 1.7-fold by the treatment (111 ± 38 and 66 ± 11 cells in treated and untreated animals, respectively, n = 3 animals, 6 hemispheres). Furthermore, the percentage of NeuN + neurons among these BrdU + cells in the treated animals (53%, 412 NeuN + cells in total 779 BrdU + cells, n = 3 animals) was much higher than that in the untreated animals (1%, 2/198). Thus, the short-term growth factor treatment appeared to stimulate not only the proliferation of endogenous progenitors, but also their differentiation into neurons. 
 
We next sought to selectively ablate proliferative progenitors in vivo by the antimitotic drug cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C) (Doetsch et al., 1999) . Intraventricular infusion of Ara-C was started immediately after ischemia and continued for 7 days, while FGF-2 and EGF was infused between DAI2 and DAI5. Ara-C administered to the intact animals under the same condition could kill dividing cells around the lateral ventricle (H.N. and M.N., unpublished observation). As shown in Figure 2D , the Ara-C treatment significantly decreased the number of CA1 neurons (about 80% reduction) detected at DAI28 (21 ± 10 NeuN + and 23 ± 5 cresyl violet-stained cells, n = 4 animals, p < 0.01). This result is consistent with the idea that the massive increase in neuronal numbers by the growth factor treatment is attributable to increased cell divisions of endogenous progenitors. 
Activation of Endogenous Progenitors In Situ 
 
The next important issues are where progenitors responsible for generating new neurons reside and how they respond to ischemia. In the rostral forebrain, the periventricular region is the source of dividing progenitors (Doetsch et al., 1999) . Near the hippocampus, such dividing cells were also detectable around the posterior periventricle (pPV in Figure 3F ). In the intact brain, the number of BrdU + cells in the pPV was much lower than in more anterior parts of the forebrain. We found, however, that their proliferation was markedly increased following ischemia ( Figures 3I–3I ″), as in the SGL of the DG ( Figures 3J–3J ″) (see below). 
 
The BrdU-labeling method detects many cell types other than neural progenitors, particularly following ischemia, and thus hampers detailed analyses of the spatio-temporal regulation of endogenous progenitors. Thus, we next combined specific molecular markers with BrdU. Pax6, Emx2, and Mash1 are transcriptional regulators expressed in the developing hippocampus, and each factor distinguishes a specific subpopulation of neural progenitors. BrdU + cells in both the pPV and SGL of the DG expressed these markers in ischemic animals ( Figures 3I–3J ″). The expression of these markers was also detected when adult progenitors were isolated and cultured in vitro ( Figures 3K–3N ′). 
 
These molecular markers revealed the dynamic response of endogenous progenitors. Although BrdU labeling detected a transient increase in cell divisions in the pPV at DAI4 (Figure 4A) , the numbers of Pax6 + and Emx2 + cells increased as early as DAI1 and reached the maximum during DAI2-4 ( Figures 4C and 4D and data not shown). Thus, the proliferative response of progenitors appeared to precede neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Furthermore, exogenous FGF-2 and EGF induced a 2.4-fold increase in the number of BrdU + cells at DAI4 (Figure 4B) and also increased both the maximum level and duration of the responses of progenitors (Figures 4C–4E) . Similar changes were also observed in the SGL of the DG (Figures 4F–4H) .

The spatial response patterns of endogenous progenitors in and around the hippocampus were further examined Figure 3 and Figure 4 . The majority of Pax6 + , Emx2 + , and Mash1 + cells were confined to the pPV and SGL in the intact brain Figure 3 and Figure 4 . However, ischemia increased their numbers in both the pPV and hippocampal parenchyma Figure 3 and Figure 4 , and growth factors further augmented their responses (Figure 4K) . 
Origins of Progenitors Responsible for Regenerating Hippocampal Neurons 
 
The above results demonstrated that endogenous progenitors are abundant in the periventricular region near the hippocampus. To examine whether these cells are involved in the regenerative event, we labeled them in situ by two methods. First, the fluorescent dye 1,19-dioctadecyl-6,69-di(4-sulfophenyl)-3,3,39,39-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) was injected into the lateral ventricle at DAI2 in ischemic animals. DiI-labeled cells were confined to the pPV 2 days after injection ( Figures 5A and 5A ′, arrow). At DAI28, however, many DiI + cells became detectable in the hippocampus, particularly in the degenerated CA1 ( Figures 5B and 5B ′, arrow), where 88% of NeuN + cells were labeled with DiI ( Figures 5D and 5D ′; 126 cells in total 144 NeuN + cells examined, n = 2 animals, 4 hemispheres). Few DiI + cells could be detected in the CA1 when intact animals were labeled with the same method ( Figures 5C and 5C ′).

To selectively label proliferative progenitors, we next injected green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant retroviruses (Yamamoto et al., 2001a) into the ventricle of growth factor-treated animals. Two days after injection, GFP + -infected cells accumulated around the ventricle ( Figure 5E , arrow) and expressed Pax6 and Mash1 ( Figures 5F and 5G , arrowheads). At DAI28, many GFP + cells were found in the CA1 ( Figure 5H , arrow, and Figure 5I ), and a large proportion (about 59%) of Hu + cells detected in this region were labeled with GFP ( Figure 5I ; 655 GFP + cells in total 1107 Hu + cells examined, n = 3 animals). MAP2 + dendrites in the regenerated CA1 were derived from these GFP + cells ( Figure 5I ″, arrowheads). In turn, about 31% of GFP + cells became Hu + neurons ( Figures 5I and 5I ′; 655 Hu + cells in total 2084 GFP + cells examined, n = 3 animals). Some labeled cells were also scattered in other hippocampal regions and expressed neuronal markers (data not shown). 
 
Interestingly, a few GFP + cells were also found in the DG at DAI28 ( Figure 5H , arrowhead). They were aligned along the SGL, extending long radial processes toward the overlaying granule cell and molecular layers ( Figure 5J , arrowheads). Few, if any, of these GFP + cells differentiated into NeuN + ( Figures 5J and 5J ′, arrowheads) or Hu + ( Figures 5K and 5K ′, arrowheads) neurons. They were also negative for GFAP ( Figures 5L and 5L ′, arrowheads), reminiscent of progenitors that normally reside in the SGL. We did not detect such cells, however, when intact animals were labeled with the same method. Thus, the migration of periventricular cells into the DG may be either specific following ischemia, or normally occurring at a very low frequency. 
 
As described above, many BrdU + cells were detected at DAI7 in the pPV, but their number was decreased thereafter (Figure 4B) . Concomitantly, TuJ1 + and Hu + neurons once emerged around the ventricle around DAI14 ( Figure 4B , and data not shown) and disappeared at DAI28 (Figure 4B) . This timing appeared to coincide with the emergence of newborn CA1 neurons. Furthermore, some DiI + cells that migrated into the CA1 very early (during DAI7-10) expressed progenitor markers such as Pax6 ( Figure 5A ′, left inset). Thus, both newly generated neurons and undifferentiated progenitors may migrate into the hippocampus from the periventricular region. In addition, we detected Pax6 + , Emx2 + , and Mash1 + cells in the CA1 at DAI2-4, the stage earlier than the timing when DiI- and GFP-labeled cells became detectable in this region ( Figures 4J and 4K , and data not shown). These cells may correspond to neural progenitors resident within the hippocampal parenchyma. Taking these results together, progenitors present in both the periventricular region and parenchyma may participate in regenerating new neurons after ischemia. 
Regenerated Neurons Participate in the Brain Circuitry 
 
We next examined the degree of maturation and connectivity of regenerated CA1 neurons. In the oriens and radiatum layers of the intact CA1, staining for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) detected abundant dendrites that contacted with multiple synapsin I + presynaptic fibers ( Figures 6A, 6A ′, and 6A″). Ischemic insults eliminated these dendrites almost completely, leaving presynaptic components largely undisturbed ( Figures 6B, 6B ′, and 6B″). In contrast, dendritic structures were restored, albeit at a reduced density, in growth factor-treated animals at DAI84 ( Figures 6C, 6C ′, and 6C″). Triple staining with BrdU, MAP2, and synaptophysin suggested that newly generated neurons received synaptic inputs (Figure 6D) .
