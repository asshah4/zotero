Abstract
Objective: To analyze prospectively the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and clinical outcome in patients treated with prednisone for exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Design: Prospective observational study. Subjects and methods: Patients presenting to the emergency department were randomized to receive 40 mg prednisone daily for 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled manner. The HPA axis was longitudinally assessed with the 1 mg corticotropin test and a clinical hypocortisolism score at baseline, on day 6 before blinded treatment, at hospital discharge, and for up to 180 days of follow-up. Prednisone was stopped abruptly, irrespective of the test results. Patients discharged with pathological test results received instructions about emergency hydrocortisone treatment. Results: A total of 311 patients were included in the analysis. Mean basal and stimulated serum total cortisol levels were highest on admission (496G398 and 816G413 nmol/l respectively) and lowest on day 6 (235G174 and 453G178 nmol/l respectively). Pathological stimulation tests were found in 63, 38, 9, 3, and 2% of patients on day 6, at discharge, and on days 30, 90, and 180 respectively, without signiﬁcant difference between treatment groups. Clinical indicators of hypocortisolism did not correlate with stimulation test results, but cortisol levels were inversely associated with re-exacerbation risk. There were no hospitalizations or deaths as a result of adrenal crisis. Conclusion: Dynamic changes in the HPA axis occur during and after the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. In hypocortisolemic patients who were provided with instructions about stress prophylaxis, the abrupt termination of prednisone appeared safe.

Introduction
The use of systemic glucocorticoids is a cornerstone in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (1). Many COPD patients experience repeated exacerbations and are therefore burdened with the acute and cumulative adverse effects of this therapy. Thus, exposure to glucocorticoids should be minimized. Recently, the Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD (REDUCE) randomized controlled trial demonstrated the noninferiority of a 5-day as compared to a 14-day treatment course of 40 mg oral prednisone daily with respect to re-exacerbation during 6 months of follow-up (2).
Treatment with therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids suppresses the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which results in impaired adrenal reserve and hypocortisolism after the exogenous steroid supply has been stopped (3). Whether duration of glucocorticoid therapy and/or cumulative dose predict adrenal insufﬁciency (4) or not (5, 6) is controversial. Stimulation tests are usually needed to assess the HPA axis because basal cortisol levels may be within the normal range, particularly in secondary adrenal insufﬁciency (3), and they do not reliably reﬂect adrenal reserve (5). The insulin tolerance test is the generally agreed upon reference standard (7), but it is not used in routine clinical practice because of the potential hazards of hypoglycemia. To evaluate adrenal responsiveness to stress, the short corticotropin test, which uses 250 mg of i.v. 1–24 adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), is the one that is most commonly employed (3). The low-dose (1 mg) corticotropin test has been recommended by some researchers to improve sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio in the evaluation of secondary adrenal insufﬁciency (8, 9, 10), but others favor the 250 mg test because of its similar performance and the availability of ready-to-use drug vials (11, 12, 13, 14). In healthy controls, both tests have been shown to elicit identical stimulated cortisol in the range observed in patients under maximum surgical stress (15).
Hypocortisolism is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs during acute illness or in other stressful situations. When terminating glucocorticoid treatment, it is therefore common to taper the dose and instruct patients about stress prophylaxis if adrenal insufﬁciency is suspected or has been biochemically proven. The practice of tapering glucocorticoids is an area of uncertainty, and data from prospective studies on it are scarce. In patients that have been treated for acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD, there is no evidence of the superiority

of a particular withdrawal scheme over another with respect to rebound of the disease or acute adrenal insufﬁciency (16). We therefore prospectively studied adrenal function and the impact of biochemically proven hypocortisolism on clinical symptoms and outcome over 6 months. We aimed to evaluate the safety of abruptly terminating systemic glucocorticoid treatment in the setting of acute exacerbations of COPD.
Subjects and methods
Study design and patients
For the present prespeciﬁed analysis, we used data from the REDUCE multicenter noninferiority trial that had previously been published (2, 17). In brief, patients who presented to the emergency department with acute exacerbation of COPD were included. Glucocorticoid pretreatment was deﬁned as daily systemic therapy for 2 or more days directly preceding study inclusion (2). After 5 days of treatment with 40 mg prednisone daily, patients were randomly allocated to continued prednisone therapy or a matching placebo for 9 days. There was no tapering after treatment was completed. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to COPD re-exacerbation during a follow-up period of 6 months. All patients were treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7 days and with the following inhaled agents from enrolment through the end of the follow-up period: Tiotropium 18 mg (Spirivae HandiHalere) once daily plus either Fluticasone 250 mg/ Salmeterol 50 mg (Seretidee spray or disc) or Budenoside 400 mg plus Formoterol 12 mg (Symbicorte Turbuhalere). The trial was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating hospitals and registered with Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN19646069). All patients provided written informed consent.
Assessment of the HPA axis
We assessed adrenal function with the low-dose (1 mg) corticotropin test, which has been advocated in the evaluation of central adrenal insufﬁciency (9). Syringes containing 1 mg of 1–24 ACTH in 1 ml 0.1 molar acetate buffer containing albumin were prepared by the hospital pharmacy of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, by diluting commercially available 250 mg ampoules (Synacthene, Novartis Pharma). The content was conﬁrmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry,

and syringes were kept at 4 8C until use. Serum cortisol was measured in a core laboratory at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, by a chemoluminescence assay on a Cobas 6000 analyzer (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) before and 30 min after i.v. injection of 1 mg corticotropin. Despite minimal interference with exogenous prednisone in the assay (!1% cross-reactivity of the antibody), stimulation tests were performed 24 h after the last prednisone dose, just before the dose administered on the test day. Results were considered normal if at least one of the two cortisol values was 500 nmol/l or higher. Tests were performed before administering the ﬁrst glucocorticoid dose in the emergency room, on day 6 before initiating blinded treatment, and on the day of discharge. The test was performed on day 30 in patients who had a biochemically suppressed HPA at discharge, and repeated tests were done on days 90 and 180 unless results became normal.
Signs and symptoms suggestive of hypocortisolism were evaluated using a modiﬁed performance score established for hypoadrenergic patients on glucocorticoid replacement therapy (18) that has been adapted to COPD patients (19). The score contained the following six items: fatigue, loss of energy, reduced strength, muscle pain, nausea, and symptoms of hypoglycemia. The item ‘hyperpigmentation’ was omitted from the original test version because it was not pertinent for secondary adrenal insufﬁciency. Each item was rated by the patient on a scale from 0 (no notice of symptom or sign) to 6 (very strong symptom or sign); the overall score thus ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 36 points.
Patients with biochemically suppressed adrenal glands at discharge were given an information sheet detailing the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufﬁciency, along with an emergency kit containing ﬁve 10 mg hydrocortisone tablets. They were instructed to take 30–50 mg of hydrocortisone and to seek professional help if symptoms suggestive of hypocortisolism occurred. Physicians involved in their care after hospital discharge were informed about the pathological results of their low-dose corticotropin tests.
Statistical analysis
Data are described using meansGS.D., medians (quartiles), and frequencies (percentages), as appropriate. To evaluate differences between the groups, the Mann–Whitney U test was used for continuous variables, and Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables. Correlations between clinical signs of hypocortisolism and test results were

measured using Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient. To study associations of baseline factors with the risk for COPD re-exacerbation during follow-up, we used logistic regression models, and we report odds ratios (ORs). Logistic models were adjusted for potential confounding variables, including glucocorticoid use before hospitalization, age, GOLD COPD grade, present nicotine use, and sex. A twosided P value of !0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. All calculations were performed using Stata version 12.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
Of the 717 patients evaluated for eligibility, 311 had a diagnosis of acute COPD exacerbation and underwent randomization. The meanGS.D. age of patients was 69.8G 10.9 years; 60.5% were male (Table 1). The majority of patients had severe or very severe COPD, with 32.6 and 53.8% in GOLD grades III and IV respectively. A total of 20.1% of patients had received systemic glucocorticoid pretreatment upon study entry. Among these individuals, the median daily dose at inclusion was 20 mg prednisone equivalent.
Adrenal function testing
Upon hospital admission, corticotropin stimulation tests were performed before the ﬁrst glucocorticoid dose in 236 of the 311 patients (75.9%). It was not logistically possible to test all of the patients undergoing randomization. Basal and stimulated cortisol levels were highest on admission (496G398 and 816G413 nmol/l respectively) and lowest on day 6 (235G174 and 453G178 nmol/l respectively), and they showed a gradual increase thereafter (Table 2 and Fig. 1). In the complete cohort, the proportions of patients with a pathological corticotropin stimulation test at hospital discharge and on day 30 were 38 and 9% respectively, and those proportions decreased to 3 and 2% after 90 and 180 days respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed an OR of 5.2 (95% CI, 2.4–11.4, P!0.001) for a pathological low-dose corticotropin stimulation test at baseline (day 1) in patients who had been pretreated with glucocorticoids. The proportions of the pathological test results did not differ signiﬁcantly between the treatment groups at any time point.
At hospital discharge, patients in the 5-day treatment group had signiﬁcantly higher mean basal (332G213 nmol/l vs 266G197 nmol/l, PZ0.03) and stimulated (545G209 nmol/l vs 475G203 nmol/l,

PZ0.017) cortisol levels (Table 2). At all other time points, there were no sizeable differences in basal or stimulated cortisol levels between the two steroid exposure groups.
Association of cortisol levels with clinical symptoms
To evaluate the associations of cortisol levels with clinical symptoms, we correlated basal and stimulated values at various time points with symptoms of adrenal insufﬁciency using a modiﬁed score derived from a standardized questionnaire (18, 19). A higher score indicated more symptoms of hypocortisolism. In general, cortisol levels correlated weakly or not at all with any individual clinical item at the different time points (Table 3). Basal and stimulated cortisol values did not correlate consistently with any single item or the total points in the adrenal insufﬁciency score across the various time points. Moreover, correction for multiple testing resulted in statistical signiﬁcance at a P value of !0.0006. At this level, none of the correlations was statistically signiﬁcant.
We also compared clinical symptoms of hypocortisolism in patients with normal and pathological low-dose corticotropin test at each time point, considering the

complete cohort and patients with 5-day and 14-day glucocorticoid therapy separately. No statistically signiﬁcant difference could be detected, regardless of the treatment duration (Fig. 2A, B, and C). Thus, biochemical suppression of the HPA axis did not translate into clinically detectable adrenal insufﬁciency.
Associations of adrenal function with risk for adrenal crisis, COPD re-exacerbation, and glucocorticoid exposure after hospital discharge
During the follow-up of 180 days, no patients needed treatment for adrenal crisis, despite the high proportion of patients with impaired adrenal function, in particular at hospital discharge.
We investigated the association between adrenal function, as assessed biochemically at various time points, and the later risk for COPD re-exacerbation using a logistic regression model adjusted for glucocorticoid use before hospitalization, age, COPD severity as reﬂected by GOLD grade, active nicotine consumption, and sex (Table 4). Overall, basal and stimulated cortisol levels were inversely associated with re-exacerbation risk, whereas a

pathological low-dose corticotropin test was associated with higher odds for re-exacerbation. The numbers reached statistical signiﬁcance on day 6, when an insufﬁcient adrenal response to corticotropin was associated with an OR of 2.21 (PZ0.006), and higher basal and stimulated cortisol levels were associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk for re-exacerbation (OR: 0.27 and 0.09, PZ0.001 and 0.001 respectively). We also conducted a survival analysis for time to re-exacerbation using a proportional hazard model that included the same covariates as our primary logistic regression model but considered stimulated cortisol levels assessed on day 6, at discharge, and on days 30 and 90 as time-dependent covariate. Consistent with the logistic regression, we found a signiﬁcant negative association between stimulated cortisol and risk of re-exacerbation; a doubling of the stimulated cortisol level was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.47–0.90, PZ0.01). Patients treated with glucocorticoid before admission to the emergency room were prescribed signiﬁcantly higher mean cumulative steroid doses after hospital discharge until the end of follow-up (433G73 vs 150G26 mg prednisone, mean difference 284 mg (95% CI, 408–159), P!0.0001). In patients with a pathological corticotropin test at hospital discharge, there was a trend toward a higher glucocorticoid exposure during follow-up than that seen in patients with a normal test (305 mg prednisone equivalent vs 196 mg respectively; mean absolute difference: 109 mg (95% CI, K41 to 259), PZ0.15).

Discussion
The REDUCE randomized controlled trial (2) longitudinally assessed adrenal function in patients with acute COPD exacerbation allocated to conventional (14-day) or short (5-day) treatment with 40 mg prednisone daily. At study entry, 15% of patients presented with adrenal insufﬁciency, as judged by the low-dose (1 mg) corticotropin test; of these, 45% had been pretreated with systemic glucocorticoids (compared to only 14% in patients with a normal low-dose corticotropin test) (2). After 5 days of systemic glucocorticoid treatment, 63% of patients showed a biochemically suppressed adrenal gland. This ﬁnding is in accordance with earlier data, which showed that short-term (5–20 days of) therapy with R25 mg prednisone equivalent dailyled to biochemical adrenal suppression in w45–90% of subjects (6, 19). In the present study, 38% of our patients were discharged from the hospital with a pathological low-dose corticotropin test. This proportion was the same in the short-term and conventional therapy groups, despite differing treatment durations and differences in median length of hospital stay (8 days (interquartile range (IQR): 5–11) in the shortterm and 9 days (IQR: 6–14) in the conventional group respectively (2)). At no time point did we ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in the percentage of pathological stimulation test results between the groups, although the cumulative prednisone doses in the short-term and conventional treatment groups after 6 months differed signiﬁcantly (mean: 379 vs 793 mg at the end of follow-up respectively; difference in means: K414 mg (95% CI, K521 to K307, P%0.001)) (2). Our ﬁndings support the notion that the cumulative glucocorticoid dose does not predict adrenal function or the pace of recovery following suppression by exogenous glucocorticoids (5, 6).
Interestingly, we found a signiﬁcant inverse correlation between cortisol levels, measured on day 6 and after, and the risk of COPD re-exacerbation during the 6-month follow-up. This is, to our knowledge, a novel ﬁnding. It is conceivable that lower endogenous cortisol levels (i.e., persistent suppression of the circadian rhythm of the HPA axis) could mirror weaker antiinﬂammatory activity and thus could have led to an increased risk of re-exacerbation. Alternatively, more frequent re-exacerbations could have led to increased glucocorticoid use and thus suppression of the HPA axis. Our data do not permit us to deﬁne the causality of our observation, but they do underscore the notion that glucocorticoid exposure should be minimized in patients with COPD.

hypocortisolism in patients with biochemically normal and pathological adrenal function across all time points, we found no differences. This result conﬁrms earlier ﬁndings from a smaller study (19) and suggests that the

low-dose corticotropin test for clinically relevant cortisol deﬁciency may yield false pathologic results in the setting of acute COPD exacerbation. Thus, our data do not support cortisol measurements before and after the treatment of exacerbated COPD outside the context of clinical trials.
When systemic glucocorticoid therapy is rapidly discontinued, a rebound of the treated inﬂammatory disease, speciﬁc signs and symptoms of hypocortisolism, or an unspeciﬁc withdrawal syndrome may theoretically occur alone or in combination (20). In clinical practice, physicians use corticotropin stimulation tests to evaluate the indication of replacement therapy or to guide tapering after glucocorticoid treatment (21). Whether this approach is justiﬁed, particularly in the absence of clinical symptoms of hypocortisolism, is unclear, seeing as in acute illness, mechanisms other than ACTH stimulation have been shown to be involved in providing adequate cortisol levels (22). Multiple glucocorticoid tapering schemes are in use, but randomized controlled trials are rare. A small study in patients discharged from the hospital after glucocorticoid treatment for acute asthma attacks found no differences in lung function between patients randomized to either abrupt stopping or tapering prednisolone over 2 weeks (23). An analysis that included nine randomized controlled trials in which patients were withdrawn from systemic glucocorticoid treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic disorders found no difference in adverse effects between withdrawal regimens (16). We stopped prednisone treatment without tapering irrespective of glucocorticoid therapy before study entry and irrespective of adrenal function at any time point throughout the trial, but we provided patients with pathological corticotropin tests at hospital discharge and thereafter with instructions on emergency replacement therapy. Despite the abrupt discontinuation of prednisone even in patients with a biochemically suppressed HPA axis, none of the patients experienced a hypoadrenergic crisis. This suggests that in the setting of acute exacerbation of COPD, tapering is not needed even after 14 days of treatment with prednisone. Nevertheless, our ﬁndings should not mislead clinicians to underestimate the dangers of adrenal crisis in situations of greater stress than those that occurred in the present study.
The present study has several limitations. The protocol did not plan to detect speciﬁc indications for glucocorticoid medication during the follow-up period apart from COPD re-exacerbation. We therefore cannot specify which patients were given glucocorticoids for stress prophylaxis or whether cumulative glucocorticoid

ORs refer to the change in risk associated with the respective risk factor and were estimated using logistic regression models with adjustment for glucocorticoid use before hospitalization, age, COPD severity (as assessed by GOLD), active nicotine consumption and sex. Cortisol levels (nmol/l) were log-transformed. ORs associated with cortisol levels correspond to a tenfold increase in cortisol concentration and refer to logistic regression models adjusted for glucocorticoid use prior to hospitalization, age, COPD severity (according to GOLD grade), active nicotine consumption and sex.

stress doses were associated with performance in the corticotropin stimulation test. We did observe a trend toward higher total glucocorticoid exposure after hospital discharge until the end of follow-up in patients with a pathological test at discharge. However, we cannot formally prove a causal relation of this ﬁnding to the higher risk of COPD re-exacerbation in patients with lower cortisol values. Also, our protocol was not designed to assess which drugs patients were taking across different time points (apart from those related to COPD management). To assess the signs and symptoms of cortisol deﬁciency, we used a modiﬁed clinical score originally developed for patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufﬁciency on cortisone replacement therapy (18). Although this score has been used in patients with COPD exacerbations (19), it was not designed and has not been formally validated for this clinical setting. Also, it does not speciﬁcally detect mental symptoms of glucocorticoid deﬁciency, although we did not observe any patients with a clinically relevant steroid withdrawal syndrome. Our ﬁndings suggest that the signs and symptoms of the score are not speciﬁc enough to clinically detect biochemically proven hypocortisolism.
In conclusion, early biochemical suppression of the adrenal glands occurred in about two-thirds of patients treated for acute COPD exacerbation. A pathological

low-dose (1 mg) corticotropin test did not translate into clinical hypocortisolism, but it did reﬂect a higher risk for COPD re-exacerbation. In patients treated for exacerbated COPD, abruptly stopping glucocorticoids while also providing emergency hydrocortisone tablets and adequate instructions for their use was safe even in patients with biochemically suppressed adrenal glands.
