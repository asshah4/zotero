Description of the Programs
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) supports programs to encourage physicians to enter careers involving research. Two NIDDK-supported summer programs, the NIDDK Medical Student Research Program in Diabetes and the Vanderbilt O’Brien Summer Kidney Research Program, are concluding with the fifth annual NIDDK Medical Student Research Symposium at Vanderbilt University on July 31 – August 1, 2013. These programs offer first- and second-year medical students the opportunity to conduct mentored research. The research opportunities range from basic laboratory studies to clinical studies in humans. Participating students also participate in a core curriculum of seminars on research approaches as well as a variety of clinical and research topics in diabetes and kidney disease. These programs help students gain an improved understanding of career opportunities in biomedical research. At the conclusion of the summer, each student presents his/her work at the national research symposium, which provides a venue for the students to meet, share their research, and to learn about career pathways and opportunities in NIDDK-related professions. The NIDDK Medical Student Research Program in Diabetes began in 2009. For the summer of 2013 program, 114 students from 68 medical schools were chosen to conduct research under the direction of an established scientist in the areas of diabetes, metabolism, obesity and digestive disease at an institution with one of 16 NIDDK-funded Diabetes Research Centers. Some students were supported by the Diabetic Complications Consortium. The Vanderbilt O’Brien Medical Student Research Program in Kidney Diseases, funded by the NIDDK and coordinated through the Vanderbilt O’Brien Kidney Physiology and Disease Center, began in 2011. For the summer of 2013 program, 17 first-year medical students from 13 medical schools were selected to participate in this program. These students have been conducting research on aspects of kidney injury and associated diseases under the supervision of NIDDK-funded investigators in 17 different laboratories and clinical research programs at Vanderbilt University.

His research experience includes diabetes, metabolism, genomics, bioinformatics, and computer simulation/modeling. Dr. Castle joined the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, NIDDK, NIH, DHHS in 2004, where he is current the program director for fellowships (“F”) awards, institutional training grants, metabolomics and informatics.
Kerri L. Cavanaugh MD, MHS received her bachelor's degree in Chemistry and Psychology from Dartmouth College in 1995, her medical degree from Yale in 1999 and completed an Internal Medicine Residency and fellowship in Nephrology in 2005. During this time she also served as Chief Resident of Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 2006, she graduated from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with a Masters in Health Science degree with a focus in clinical epidemiology. She joined the faculty at Vanderbilt in Internal Medicine Division of Nephrology and the Vanderbilt Center for Health Services Research in 2006, she is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine and serves as the Medical Director for the Vanderbilt Campus Dialysis Clinic. Dr. Cavanaugh's primary research interest is to identify mechanisms and interventions to facilitate patientprovider health communication about complex chronic kidney disease care to improve patient understanding, self-efficacy, participation in self-care and health outcomes. She has experience and expertise in survey design, validation and administration, development of educational interventional materials, protocol and training development, and also execution of trials to examine educational/behavioral interventions. She is currently examining methods to enhance anemia management by promoting shared-decision making and safe use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents. She has been funded by the NIH and the National Kidney Foundation.
Mark de Caestecker, MB, BS, PhD, received his undergraduate degree from Cambridge University and medical degree (M.B., B.S.) from The Middlesex Hospital (now University College) in London, England. After training in internal medicine at the Middlesex and Charring Cross Hospitals in London, Dr. de Caestecker trained in Nephrology, obtained his PhD in Medicine at the University of Manchester, and underwent post-doctoral training on a Wellcome Trust Clinical Scientist Fellowship at the NIH under the mentorship of Dr. Anita Roberts. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Division of Nephrology at Vanderbilt, and conducts NIH funded research on regenerative therapies in acute and chronic kidney injury, and on hereditary vascular diseases. He currently serves on the Respiratory and Integrative Biology and Translational Research study section. Dr. de Caestecker is Director of the Vanderbilt-HHMI Certificate Program in Molecular Medicine, and Director of the Vanderbilt O’Brien Kidney Center Education program. He has directed the short-term summer research-training program in nephrology for the last three years.
Steven E. Kahn, MB, ChB grew up in South Africa where he received his medical education at the University of Cape Town. After doing required rotational training in obstetrics and gynecology and in medicine, he immigrated to the United States where he did an internal medicine residency at Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. Thereafter, he undertook his fellowship training in endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he has been on the faculty since. He is currently Professor of Medicine in the Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and
15

Nutrition and has held leadership roles at the University, including being Associate Chief of Staff for Research and Development at VA Puget Sound Health Care System. He currently directs the Diabetes Research Center at the University of Washington. Dr. Kahn has a robust research program involving both clinical and basic investigation of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, and which is funded by the NIH, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the American Diabetes Association. His clinical studies have included participation in the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program that demonstrated that diabetes can be prevented in individuals who are at high risk for the disease and in ADOPT, which compared the approach to initial therapy for patients with early type 2 diabetes. He is also leading the Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study, a multicenter clinical trial which was recently launched by NIH to study novel ways to prevent the loss of insulin secretion and thus slow the progression of hyperglycemia in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. His basic studies have focused on the role of amyloid as a destructive process in the islet. Another important component of his academic life is the training of medical students and fellows. These individuals have come from the United States and abroad and have had very positive impacts on his program and have used the knowledge gained working with him in establishing their own successful programs.
Monica Peek, MD, MPH, FACP, is an Assistant Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Chicago where she provides clinical care, teaches and does health services research in the area of health disparities. She received her medical degree and master’s degree in public health from the Johns Hopkins University, and completed her residency training at Stanford University Hospital. She then worked for the National Health Service Corps for two years at a community health center for the medically underserved in Ohio before relocating to Chicago.
Dr. Peek is the Associate Director of the Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research and a member of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) program office Finding Answers: Disparities Research for Change. She has been funded by RWJF and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to explore racial differences in patient/provider communication and to pilot patient-empowerment interventions to enhance such communication among racial/ethnic minorities with diabetes. She is an inaugural faculty fellow of the Bucksbaum Institute for Clinical Excellence. Dr. Peek is the Principal Investigator of grants from the Merck Company Foundation and NIH/NIDDK to improve diabetes care and outcomes among residents on the South Side of Chicago, a predominantly African-American working class community with significant disparities in diabetes health outcomes such as lower extremity amputations. Dr. Peek was part of the NIDDK strategic planning committee whose 2010 report ‘Advances and Emerging Opportunities in Diabetes Research’ set forth the diabetes research agenda for the next 5-10 years.
Dr. Peek also does research on the development and evaluation of community-based, culturallytailored interventions to promote healthy behaviors and preventive care, including women’s health (i.e. breast cancer screening), physical activity and diabetes self-management. 	   	   Alvin C. Powers, MD, the Joe C. Davis Chair in Biologic Science and Professor of Medicine, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics at Vanderbilt University, is the Director of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center, the Chief of the Vanderbilt Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolism, and the Director of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center, a NIH-funded center that facilities the diabetesrelated research of more than 100 Vanderbilt scientists.

Three-Dimensional Image Analysis of Human Intraepidermal Nerve Fibers Nicholas E. Rebhan, B.S., B.A. (Wayne State University SOM), Alexandra E. Münch, B.A. A. Gordon Smith, M.D., Stephen I. Lentz, Ph.D., and Eva L. Feldman, M.D., Ph.D. University of Michigan
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most frequent complications of chronic diabetes mellitus (DM) and is the leading cause of non-traumatic amputations. The current accepted method of diagnosis is the use of skin biopsy to obtain intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density count under bright field microscopy. This project seeks to develop a 3-dimensional fluorescent microscopy technique to quantify morphological characteristics of IENFs that may be affected by the diabetic neuropathy disease process. A 3mm cutaneous punch biopsy was taken from both the distal thigh and distal leg of 20 patients (4 healthy controls, 9 diabetic patients without neuropathy, and 7 diabetic patients with neuropathy), sectioned, stained with fluorescent markers, and fixed onto glass slides. A Leica SP5 confocal fluorescent microscope was used to take Z-series images of the stained tissues and images were processed through Imaris software to render representation of nerve surfaces and filaments. Using this technique, we quantified the morphological characteristics of nerve volume, nerve straightness, and branching behavior. We found that Nerve Volume Ratio (volume of nerve surfaces per volume of epidermis) decreased with disease progression in the distal thigh. Straightness showed a significant increase in both the distal thigh and the distal leg. We also found that small fiber nerves tend to branch more in the distal thigh as diabetes progresses into diabetic peripheral neuropathy. This study demonstrated that 3D image analysis is an objective technique for the characterization and quantification of IENFs. Our measurements offer insight for future research into the effect of these morphological changes and the pathogenesis of DPN.

A Novel, Digital Approach to Quantify Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density Hussein S. Hamid, B.S. (University of Michigan Medical School), Chelsea Lindblad, B.S., John M. Hayes, B.S., Eva L. Feldman, M.D., Ph.D., and Stephen I. Lentz, Ph.D., University of Michigan - Ann Arbor
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is the most common complication of diabetes. It is a condition characterized by a distal to proximal loss of cutaneous sensation that begins in the hands and feet. Skin punch biopsies have become a standard method to assess DPN as patients show a degradation of Intraepidermal Nerve Fibers (IENFs). Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density (IENFD) is a parameter that measures the number of IENFs that enter the epidermis from the dermis. The most common method to calculate IENFD uses chromagen based immunohistochemistry on skin biopsy sections followed by manual counting of IENFs at a microscope. This technique is limited by the lack of permanent images and counting records for subsequent analysis, and requires a microscope and trained technicians. We developed a novel approach that digitizes brightfield images of skin biopsy sections and uses a protocol for subsequent calculation of IENFDs that can be done at a computer without the need for a microscope. We obtained skin biopsies from the proximal thigh of 20 healthy control patients and analyzed 4 sections per patient (80 sections total). We showed that the IENFDs calculated using our novel digital approach significantly correlates with IENFDs calculated from the standard manual counting method. Our novel method of quantifying IENFD allows for a permanent and transferrable record of skin biopsy sections that expedites training, collaboration, technique standardization, and subsequent analysis without the need to be physically present at a microscope.

Diet-induced obesity impairs Regulatory B lymphocyte proliferation and function Joseph Hsiao (St. Louis University School of Medicine), Lan Wu, and Luc Van Kaer (Vanderbilt University Medical Center)
Chronic low-level inflammation is a recognized hallmark of obesity and an important player in the development of insulin resistance in Type 2 Diabetes. Conventional B lymphocytes promote this inflammatory response in conjunction with T cells and macrophages. Regulatory B lymphocytes (Bregs) modulate inflammation under a number of chronic inflammatory conditions through secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines, in particular IL-10. Thus, we hypothesized that obese mice would have fewer Bregs and that the Bregs would be less competent in producing IL-10 in their metabolic organs. To test this, we compared the amount of Bregs and the Breg IL-10 levels in mice fed on a 12-week high fat diet against those fed a low fat diet. We used FACS to detect and quantify Breg markers (CD19highB220lowCD5+) in the spleen, peritoneal cavity (PerC), and stromal vascular fraction of white adipose tissue (SVF). While the splenic composition was unchanged, the proportion of Bregs decreased in the PerC (4.2 ± 0.2%) and SVF (4.6 ± 1.1%) of obese mice compared to lean PerC (7.6 ± 2.1%) and SVF (7.8 ± 1.5%). Intracellular staining for IL-10 revealed a similar decrease from 88.1 ± 2.2% in the lean PerC to 71.7 ± 10% in the obese PerC and 36.8 ± 6% in the lean SVF to 22.3 ± 5.7% in the obese SVF. These data suggest a possible therapeutic route for Type 2 Diabetes through modulation of Breg number and/or function in obese mice. Further studies include measurement of glucose tolerance in obese mice supplemented with Bregs isolated from donor mice or in vitro differentiated in culture.

Patients with hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes have defined phenotypes specific to their syndrome. Celina Jacobi (Washington University School of Medicine), Katie Gettinger, RN, CPNP, Jennifer Henry, BA, Todd Druley, MD, PhD, Beth Kozel, MD, PhD, Marwan Shinawi, MD, Robert Hayashi, MD, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis Children’s Hospital
Hereditary Cancer Predisposition Syndromes (HCPS) are hereditary conditions that are associated with malignancies that develop in diverse organ systems at any age. There are several well described conditions, such as Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome, Hemihypertrophy, Pleuropulmonaryblastoma, Familial adenomatous polyposis, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, that are associated with a restricted scope of malignancies. However, the scope of nonmalignant conditions characteristic of each HCPS is varied and frequently poorly described. We hypothesize that patients with cancer predisposition syndromes have a defined phenotype with a range of specific physical, cognitive, and psychological difficulties that correlate to their diagnosis. In order to characterize each syndrome, we designed a longitudinal database and are currently enrolling pediatric patients with a HCPS diagnosis. Participants’ parents will complete a health history questionnaire each year until their child turns 18, assessing their child’s physical, cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial health and noting the age of occurrence for each positive symptom. Additionally, the child’s medical record will be reviewed to collect information, such as height and weight, limb measurements, and genetic testing. We anticipate that these tools will depict the specific phenotype of each HCPS and demonstrate the evolution of patients’ symptoms over time. The current standard of care for most HCPS with poorly defined phenotypes is surveillance for malignancy with frequent screenings until the patient ages out of the high risk population. However, greater knowledge of each syndromes’ phenotype will encourage holistic treatment that extends beyond tumor monitoring to improve patients’ quality of life and long term wellbeing.

Recurrent Yohimbine (YOH) Administration as a Model for Recurrent Stress Susan Hill (University of Puerto Rico), Connie West, Jennifer Jay, Aryana Zavosh, Dianne Figlewicz Lattemann, VA Puget Sound Health Care System and University of Washington, Seattle, Washington
We hypothesized that recurrent pharmacological activation of brain noradrenergic pathways sufficiently models recurrent stress such that it can be a model to evaluate food intake/energy homeostasis and motivational behavior. Rats were injected every other day for two weeks with either the adrenergic agent YOH or saline (SAL) in the peritoneal cavity while their behavior was monitored. The rats then participated in a sucrose self-administration protocol for 4 weeks. Using cFos immunocytochemistry quantitation we determined activation of specific areas of the brain. The rats injected with YOH showed increased activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala and the dorsal striatum versus SAL injected rats. Clear distinctions in behavior across all six injections were noted in the YOH- versus SAL-injected rats. The brain activation pattern, difficulties in sleeping, and heightened agitation seen in the YOHinjected rats correlate well with known behaviors in human subjects with PTSD. Preliminary data from the sucrose self-administration tests suggest an increase in food reward amongst the YOH-treated rats, which will be replicated in additional cohorts. All of the data combined imply that dietary education and behavioral modification for food intake may be important factors to include when treating patients with PTSD.

HOX6 GENES ARE CRITICAL MESODERMAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS THAT MODULATE PANCREATIC ORGANOGENESIS Bright H. Kim (University of Michigan Medical School), Brian M. Larsen, Deneen M. Wellik, Division of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center
Hox genes encode a family of important transcription factors that modulate various developmental processes such as skeletal morphogenesis, neural patterning, and organogenesis. Of the four Hox clusters (A-D) that are organized into thirteen paralogous groups in mammals, the Hox6 paralogous group includes three genes—Hoxa6, b6, c6—that encode critical mesenchymal transcription factors that modulate various aspects of pancreatic organogenesis. We show that loss of Hox6 function produces phenotypic abnormalities of the pancreas that are not seen in wild-type mice embryos. Our lab set out to characterize these phenotypes by comparing epithelial and mesenchyme volume, cellular proliferation, extent of epithelial branching, and endocrine cell mass between Hox6 mutant and wild type embryos. Through immunofluorescence assay and fluorescence microscopy of mouse embryos at different embryonic days, these phenotypic characteristics were measured and quantified. The overall epithelial volume of the pancreas in mutants is significantly reduced compared to littermate controls by embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5). Although there is no significant difference in mesenchyme volume or proliferation, the number of endocrine cells, particularly insulinproducing beta cells, decreases drastically by E18.5. Hox6 mutants also exhibit abnormal epithelial branching and reduced epithelial cell proliferation. These data demonstrate that Hox6 genes are critical mesenchymal transcription factors necessary for the proper development and maintenance of the pancreas. As the function of the mesodermal niche of the pancreas is better understood, regenerative therapies of in vitro endocrine cell development may be improved for diabetic patients.

Mitochondrial translocator (TSPO) Distribution and Localization in the Mouse Brain. Meredith M. McKenney1, Misty M. Thompson2 & Kate L.J. Ellacott2 1University of Texas Health Science Center Houston 2Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is an outer-mitochondrial membrane transporter which has many functions including participation in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, regulation of apoptosis, cholesterol binding and translocation for steroidogenesis, regulation of reactive oxygen species, and production of cellular energy. TSPO has also emerged as a reliable inflammatory marker in disease pathologies due to its up-regulation in activated glia cells (astrocytes and microglia) in the CNS and in macrophages in the periphery. The distribution of TSPO in the “normal” mouse brain has thus largely been characterized by autoradiography and positron emission tomography (PET) with radiolabeled TSPO ligands. A fine mapping study of TSPO expression in the mouse brain has not been performed and was the goal of the current project. Our immunohistochemistry (IHC) data revealed a novel distribution of TSPO throughout the hypothalamus including regions such as the arcuate nucleus and dorsal medial hypothalamus (DMH) (regions important for the regulation of food intake), as well as circumventricular organs (areas lacking a tight blood brain barrier). We next hypothesized that TSPO is localized in glial cells within these hypothalamic regions. As a first step to determine the identity of TSPO-expressing cells, triple-label IHC was performed for TSPO in addition to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocyte marker) and vimentin (tanycyte/ependymal cell marker). Our preliminary data shows that TSPO co-localizes with vimentin within tanycytes and ependymal cells lining the third ventricle of the hypothalamus, which are involved in nutrient sensing. TSPO did not co-localize with all GFAP-expressing astrocytes and some TSPO-positive cells within the DMH were not GFAP- or vimentin-positive, suggesting that these cells may be microglia or neurons. The distribution and cellular expression of TSPO presented here suggest that TSPO may be involved in the regulation of food intake, energy expenditure and/or nutrient sensing pathways which should be further explored. Future directions include further characterization of the identity of TSPO-expressing hypothalamic cells and evaluating potential regulation of TSPO in the brain by metabolic state.

Inflammation in CKD and CVD: Role of Genetics and IL-1ra (Rilonacept) Jia Yi (University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine) Adriana M. Hung MD MPH, Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue. But even more concerning, patients with CKD are at a high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) related morbidity and mortality with the common mechanism being inflammation. The cause of this activated chronic inflammatory response remains unknown; however, recent work has implicated the activation of the inflammasome protein complex as the source of persistent inflammation found in many auto-inflammatory conditions. The inflammasome activates IL-1, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine, as its downstream effector making inflammasome related diseases highly IL-1 dependent. Inhibition of IL-1 with the drug Rilonacept successfully controls the auto-inflammatory response found in these diseases. In a mouse model of CKD, expression of Nlrp3 inflammasome and its resulting cytokines were increased. In addition, Nlrp3 expression in human kidney biopsies showed increased expression of various inflammasome components regardless of disease etiology. In a previous study of end stage renal disease patients, we have shown that IL-1 blockade leads to a quick and drastic 50% drop in Hs-CReactive Protein (HsCRP, an inflammatory marker), the largest response described so far in this patient population. Based on these findings, IL-1 inhibition should beneficially minimize the inflammatory response found in CKD.
In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded pilot and feasibility drug trial for the IL-1 receptor antagonist Rilonacept, we plan to determine if inhibition of the IL-1 inflammatory pathway decreases markers of inflammation, improves markers of vascular health, and slows CKD progression. The study will consist of 55 randomized participants over a 24-week treatment period. We hypothesize that Rilonacept will decrease markers of inflammation and slow CKD progression. Other markers of kidney injury (albuminuria), endothelial function (flow mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity and ADMA), oxidative stress (F2-isoprostane), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR and the leptin to adiponectin ratio) will also be measured. At this point in time, we have begun screening and recruiting patients. The study will be conducted over the next two years and is anticipated to produce a better mechanistic understanding of the inflammatory consequences of CVD in CKD.

The Effect of Literacy and Numeracy on Self-Care Behaviors in Diabetes Patients Sneha Venkatraman (University of Tennessee Health Science Center), Laura Chambers, Karen Trochez, Shari Barto and Russell Rothman, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN
Diabetes self care behaviors are important in the management of diabetes and may be influenced by patient literacy and numeracy levels. Literacy and numeracy may also have a downstream effect on glycemic control (HbA1C) in diabetic patients and on other outcomes such as perceived selfmanagement, treatment satisfaction, and medication adherence. Limited research has been done on comparing scores on different literacy and numeracy measures and how they correlate with self-care behaviors. We hypothesized that higher levels of literacy and numeracy will be associated with more frequent self-care behaviors, and that subjective measures (SLS-3 and SNS-8) may be more associated with self reported behaviors. Higher levels of literacy and numeracy may also be associated with lower levels of HbA1C and higher levels of treatment satisfaction, perceived self-efficacy, and medication adherence, and objective measures of numeracy (DNT-5) may be more associated with these outcomes. 410 adult participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus were recruited from 10 “safety net” low-income clinics in the middle Tennessee area run by the Tennessee Department of Health. Cross sectional analysis of baseline data from a cluster randomized trial examining the role of a literacy sensitive intervention to improve diabetes care was used. The S-TOFHLA and SLS-3 were used to study literacy, the DNT-5 and the SNS-8 to study numeracy, and the PDQ and SDSCA to study selfcare behaviors. The DNT-5 seemed to correlate most with multiple self-care behaviors and was closest to approaching significance with A1C levels, so more research can be done in broadening its use when studying numeracy in diabetes. Subjective and objective measures of literacy and numeracy were more correlated with the PDQ than the SDSCA. More research should be done on the uses of the PDQ in studies of diabetes. By addressing literacy and numeracy issues, this data suggests certain self-care behaviors, especially those involving using data to modify the diet, can be addressed and perhaps improved.

Liver Estrogen Signaling and the Metabolic Response to Different Macronutrient Compositions. Eric K. Singhi (Medical University of South Carolina), Melissa N. Martinez, John Stafford, MD/PhD, Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is an important health issue in developed countries. In fact, nearly onethird of Americans over the age of 35 die from CHD each year. Although many of the risk factors for CHD are non-modifiable, some risk factors can be controlled for such as an unhealthy diet. The metabolic consequences of overconsumption are especially important to understand as an excess intake of dietary fats and carbohydrates has been shown to have a profound impact on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism. Although many of today’s popular diet strategies are targeted towards improving the complications of obesity and reducing risks of CHD, identifying individuals who are best served by a specific type of diet remains a challenge. Previous research has demonstrated that women are better protected from CHD risk than men. By contrast, few studies also suggest that high-carbohydrate diets may be more harmful in women than men. With this in mind, we questioned if there is a differential effect of estrogen signaling on glucose vs. lipids. Because the liver is a unique organ such that it integrates glucose and lipid metabolism, we decided to explore hepatic estrogen signaling to better understand the mechanistic role that estrogen plays in the metabolic response to different macronutrient compositions. In order to determine the impact of high-fat vs. highsucrose feeding in the presence or absence of hepatic estrogen signaling, we used 12 week old female C57BL/6 mice that were either wild-type or lacking estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) specifically in the liver. We fed them diets that were high in fat or high in sucrose for 8 weeks. To assess glucose tolerance, a proven index of insulin sensitivity, we performed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests. We also used a high performance liquid chromatography system to examine differences in lipid profiles. We determined that a knockout model of hepatic ERalpha (LKO-ERalpha) worsened glucose tolerance on high-fat diet feeding. Interestingly, female mice with LKO-ERalpha showed improved glucose tolerance on high-sucrose feeding, but their lipid profile was worse than that of the wild-type controls. Thus, we believe that liver estrogen signaling is helpful in the setting of a high-fat diet, but may be harmful in the context of high-carbohydrate feeding. These findings may have important health benefits in helping women choose the most appropriate diet for weight loss, both pre and post menopause.

Stimulatory Effects of Glutamate on Vitamin C Efflux in Synaptosomes L. Nora Zeidan (Medical College of Georgia), M. Pierce, J. May, Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Vitamin C, VC, is an essential antioxidant that serves to protect the central nervous system from oxidative stress. It has been determined that VC is transported into neurons by Sodium-dependent Vitamin C Transporter (SVCT2), but its efflux mechanism is still undefined. To test the hypothesis that glutamate-induced vitamin C efflux is mediated via a volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), we introduced both glutamate and a series of pharmacological inhibitors that are known to act on protein channels. To assess VC efflux at the synaptic bouton, we used a crude synaptosome preparation as a model of the nerve terminal. This preparation allowed for us to introduce pharmacological anion channel inhibitors to the synaptosomes to determine if they alter glutamate-induced VC efflux. Previous studies suggest that the VRAC is sensitive to classical anion channel inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'disulfonic acid (DIDS), while SVCT2 is sensitive to sulfinpyrazone (SPZ) and phloretin (PHL). We determined that synaptosomes spontaneously efflux endogenous Vitamin C at 37° and the presence of 200µM glutamate increased efflux. DIDS did not inhibit Vitamin C efflux in synaptosomes as expected. On the other hand, sulfinpyrazone and phloretin inhibited transport of Vitamin C, therefore increasing the net efflux out of the synaptosomes. These data suggest that glutamate stimulates increased efflux in synaptosomes, but the specific mechanism remains undefined.

Dietary nitrates and nitrites as a source to reduce inflammation in diabetes and CVD Joshua Burks (University of Oklahoma), Joan Tupper, Francis Kim; University of Washington Diabetes and Obesity Center of Excellence
Current research shows abnormal cellular inflammation is associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and type II diabetes. Consequently, a reduction in inflammation is believed to restore normal physiologic insulin response. Nitric Oxide (NO) is an important mediator of inflammation that is deficient in these disease states, and recent studies indicate its production from nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) in the absence of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). To test whether dietary NO3-/ NO2reduced inflammation in adipocytes, 15 mice were fed a diet high in fat and 15 were fed a diet low in fat, and given water containing NaNO2 or vegetable pills rich in NO3-. There were also two control groups in which no supplements were given (one for high fat diet and one for low fat diet). Next we used quantitative PCR to measure levels of RNA for inflammatory proteins TNF, CCL-2, CD11b, and others. We observed a 2.5 and 3.0 fold increase in expression of CCL-2 and CD11b, respectively, with the high fat diet compared to the low fat diet. Within the low fat group, those receiving vegetable supplements demonstrated reduced inflammation. These data indicate that in a low fat diet, vegetable supplements reduce inflammation in adipocytes. However, in a high fat diet, there were no trends to indicate that either had an anti-inflammatory effect. Under those circumstances, the NO3-/ NO2- may not have reached the adipose tissue. Administering the supplements for a greater duration may have changed this outcome. On the other hand, inflammation caused by a high fat diet may be too great to be overcome by dietary nitrate/nitrite supplementation. Further study of the delivery of nitrates and nitrites into tissue presents the opportunity for new therapies to improve insulin sensitivity.

Healthy Food Choices at the Dollar General: Feasible Dietary Advice for Low Income, Rural Populations Divya Carrigan (University of Alabama School of Medicine), Monika Safford, MD, University of Alabama in Birmingham
Diet plays an important role in preventing and treating chronic diseases and obesity. However, many rural populations lack access to supermarkets selling the fresh produce that is essential for a healthy diet. As a result, many rural residents purchase a substantial proportion of their groceries at more local stores such as the Dollar General, which offer limited options, many unhealthy. Practical advice on how to make healthy food choices at the Dollar General or similar stores is currently not available. It is possible to create a culturally adapted, acceptable educational video on how to make healthy food choices at the Dollar General or similar store. The rural Alabama Black Belt is characterized by steep poverty, among the worst health outcomes in the US and scarce resources, including very few fullservice supermarkets. The area is 50-75% African American and educational quality and attainment is generally low. We used the infrastructure of a community-based research program in partnership with Black Belt communities to collaboratively develop an educational video. We used data from focus groups and previous research projects to inform the intervention design. We worked with a research nutritionist and community members to develop and pilot test the video content. Community members were integrated into the video with peer testimonials. In the future, we will show the video to 50 area residents and quantify how useful they find the video and whether it will change their food choices when shopping at the Dollar General. If found to be acceptable, the video will be integrated into a communitybased intervention in order to test the hypothesis that the intervention will lead to weight loss and healthier eating patterns in rural Alabama Black Belt residents. The video used a practical framework tailored to the major challenges relating to healthy eating in our targeted community: eating too many calories (large portions and second helpings) and inadequate intake of fresh fruits and vegetables. We developed 3 simple messages: 1) eat fewer second helpings; 2) use the “plate method” (1/4 protein, ¼ starch, ½ fruits/vegetables; and 3) eat fewer fried foods and drink fewer sugar sweetened beverages. The video demonstrated a community member in the Dollar General making choices for snacks, breakfast food, lunch and dinner. We also demonstrated how these purchases can be integrated into healthy snacks and meals. Interspersed into the video were educational segments by the nutritionist and peer testimonials on shopping at the Dollar General store for groceries and the importance of healthy eating for Black Belt residents. The community members who reviewed the script and messages provided enthusiastic endorsement for the direction, strategy and content. This educational video will provide critical missing information about how to make healthier food choices at stores that are frequented by rural residents, but that are largely overlooked in currently available dietary advice. Using just a few key messages about healthy eating specifically targeted at major challenges and barriers to healthy eating in the rural Alabama Black Belt, and using a visual approach to information dissemination is intended to improve comprehension and uptake of the information. Educational materials that are targeted culturally adapted and collaboratively developed may be used in future intervention studies to help individuals improve dietary intake.

Acute Kidney Injury: Role of Amphiregulin in Repair of Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells Matthew Breeggemann (Creighton University School of Medicine), Ming-Zhi Zhang, Bing Yao, Yinqui Wang, Jian Chang, Suwan Wang, Xiaofeng Fan, Raymond Harris Division of Nephrology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as an abrupt decrease in renal function and predominately affects the proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) located in the medullary portion of the kidney. These cells express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and are able to proliferate by associating with EGFR ligands, including amphiregulin (AREG). It is unknown whether AREG is important for the regeneration of PTECs following AKI resulting from ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. To test this hypothesis, we surgically clamped off the renal artery and vein unilaterally for 30 minutes in equal aged and gendered AREG KO transgenic mice. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measurements were taken post-surgery for seven days to assess the level of epithelial repair. Immunoblotting was preformed to assess the level of neutrophil infiltration, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), and AREG following I-R injury. Results revealed that BUN is elevated in AREG KO mice and has a slower return to baseline when compared with wild-type mice. Likewise, AREG KO mice have increased levels of proximal tubular damage following I-R injury. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that macrophages and dendritic cells are the predominant cells producing AREG. These data suggest that this ligand is important in the proliferation and regeneration of the PTECs following hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, AREG may be important in decreasing the rate of AKI reoccurrence seen in many critical patient populations.

Identification of Genes Required for the Response to Metabolic Stress Christen Elledge (Georgetown University School of Medicine), Jiyeon Lee, Jean Schaffer, Washington University School of Medicine
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due, in part, to diabetic dyslipidemia. When excess lipids accumulate in non-adipose tissues, they cause oxidative and ER stress and can lead to cell death. Endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to this lipotoxic stress. We hypothesized that we might identify novel genes involved in metabolic stress responses in endothelial cells through a lossoffunction screen using an shRNA library. A genome-wide loss-of-function screen was carried out in immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (iHUVECs) using a lentiviral shRNA screening library and growth under lipotoxic conditions. Following confirmation of resistance to lipotoxicity, shRNA-targeted genes were identified using the BLAST algorithm (NCBI) to identify specific genes. We identified several novel genes that have not previously been implicated in the response to metabolic stress. In future studies, the contributions of these genes to lipotoxicity will be confirmed by directed knockdown in wild type cells and complementation of the palmitate-resistant clones. The function of these genes in the lipotoxic pathway could provide new mechanistic insights into how excess metabolites contribute to diabetes complications and facilitate the development of novel pharmacological therapies.

Using Patient Registries To Recruit Subjects For Clinical Studies Matthew Thomas (Michigan State University College of Human Medicine), Mark MacEachern, Meng Tan (University of Michigan) University of Michigan
Background: Subject recruitment remains a significant challenge when conducting clinical studies (includes clinical trials). Identification and availability of patients, time constraints, budget, and entry criteria are factors that affect this problem. Aim: This study examines patient registries which have been useful for subject recruitment in clinical studies. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted to identify journal articles on registries used for recruiting subjects for clinical studies, followed by a careful review of all relevant articles containing such information. The search was conducted on 6/26/13, consisted of both MeSH and textword terminology, and limited to English language studies. Information on the ongoing University of Michigan Diabetes Research Registry (UMDRR) was obtained from the team that runs it. Results: The PubMed search identified 104 papers. Of these, 39 papers appear to be related to registries used for recruiting subjects for clinical studies. These registries cover of a number of diseases/conditions (Parkinson’s, atrial fibrillation with risk of stroke, glaucoma, muscular dystrophy, cancer, dementia, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, bipolar disorder, trauma, and other rare diseases and neurological conditions), groups, gender, ages, races (general population, older adults, women, children, twins, and minorities), and many countries (US, UK, Canada, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy). They operated on multi-national, national, regional, or local levels, and may be based at a single or multi-center. The majority of these registries have shown enhanced patient recruitment for clinical studies. Other studies have compared subject recruiting using registries to electronic medical records (EMR). The EMR provides a larger pool of patients but is less specific. Registries have a smaller pool of patients but are more specific. The UMDRR uses data from EMR and a registry. In 3 years it has recruited close to 3800 patients. The data in the UMDRR includes age, gender, race, BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, type and duration of diabetes, glucose lowering and other medications, HbA1C, amongst many others. During this time period 12 UM investigators utilized the UMDRR for their clinical research studies. Funding for the investigators has come from private (4), public (7), and non-governmental granting agencies (1). Summary/Conclusion: A patient registry for a specific disease can enhance and facilitate recruitment of subjects for clinical studies. It allows the identification of potential subjects for clinical studies and is a more efficient way of identifying them.

Effect of γ-MSH on Skin Electrolyte Homeostasis Brian R. Kurtz1,3, Jens M. Titze1, Friedrich C. Luft1, Christo D. Venkov1, Tetyana V. Pedchenko1, Roger D. Crone2, Erica J. Pruett2, Rachel N.

The skin interstitium responds to a high salt diet by sequestering excess Na+, K+ and Cl-, creating a hypertonic reservoir to store the excess salt. γ -MSH is a natriuretic melanocortin which regulates blood pressure and sodium metabolism by binding to the melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R). The MC3R-/- mice are hypertensive on a high salt diet. This study tests the hypothesis that MC3R-/- mice are not able to respond to increased circulating levels of γ-MSH, leading to an increase in sodium accumulation in the skin.
Electrolyte contents in the skin, carcass, and total body were determined through a combination of dry ashing, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and AgNO3 titration. MC3R-/- mice had markedly decreased electrolyte content in skin, carcass, and total body indicating that γ-MSH’s effect on electrolyte storage was not specific to the skin. The relationship between water content and electrolyte levels in skin were linear indicating that γ -MSH does not affect the concentration of electrolytes within the skin. Hypertension in these mice is not related to sodium retention.

Effect of ER Stress and Oxidative Stress on b-cell Compensation and b-cell Survival. Lucy Sun (SUNY Downstate College of Medicine), Mingyu Li, Lisette Maddison, Wenbiao Chen, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Chronic nutrient excess induces initial compensatory expansion and eventual demise of pancreatic b cells. Nutrient excess are known to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress. But the role of these cellular stress in b-cell compensation and survival have not been systemically studied. We have found that overnutrition in zebrafish induces compensatory b-cell genesis. However, with genetic insulin resistance, prolonged overnutrition causes b-cell demise. We hypothesize that ER and oxidative stress response systems may play a key role in influencing compensatory β-cell genesis and their eventual death and will test the hypothesis using both pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Here we report our preliminary findings on several genes pivotal to proper ER stress and oxidative stress including hsf1, nrf2, sirt1, and jnk1. We found that inhibition of jnk1, sirt1, or hsf1 enzymes, essential for resolving various cellular stresses, caused b-cell genesis in the absence of overnutrition. This suggests that cellular stress drives initial compensatory b-cell genesis. We have generated mutations in the aforementioned genes using TALEN mutagenesis. Preliminary analysis of nfe2 mutant that have impaired oxidative stress response showed an increased basal b-cell number, further suggesting a role of cellular stress in compensatory b-cell genesis.

Health literacy is associated with patients’ adherence-related knowledge and motivation, but not adherence or clinical outcomes Connor S. Corcoran, BS (Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California); Lindsay S. Mayberry, PhD, MS; Chandra Y. Osborn, PhD, MPH Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN
Among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), medication adherence is a strong independent predictor of glycemic control (A1C), but health literacy (i.e., the ability to obtain, process, and apply health information to make health decisions) has been inconsistently linked to medication adherence and A1C. According to the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB) model of adherence, medication adherence-related information and motivation are determinants of adherence-related behavioral skills, and these factors collectively predict medication adherence, which, in turn, predicts a health outcome. Given mixed evidence on the role of health literacy in predicting medication adherence and A1C, we hypothesized health literacy would be more strongly related to factors more distal to these outcomes (i.e., medication adherence-related information and motivation rather than medication adherence-related behavioral skills, medication adherence, or A1C). We analyzed data from 314 adult patients with T2DM who were recruited from a safety net clinic, had completed a series of interviewer-administered self-report measures, had information collected from their medical record, and had undergone a point-of-care A1C test. We conducted unadjusted and adjusted multivariate regression models (adjusted for demographic and clinic characteristics) to examine the relationships between health literacy and the aforementioned IMB model components. Participants were age 51.8±11.7 years, 65% were female, and 53% were African American/Black. Many participants had low socioeconomic status (32% had <high school degree; 45% had incomes <$10K; and 45% were uninsured), and the average A1C was 8.2%±2.2%. In unadjusted and adjusted models, health literacy was significantly associated with adherence-related information (β=0.15, p<0.05) and social motivation (β=0.24, p=0.001), and there was a trend toward a significant association with personal motivation (β=0.15, p=0.055). Health literacy was not associated with adherence-related behavioral skills, medication adherence, or A1C in unadjusted analyses. In summary, health literacy was independently associated with adherence-related information (i.e., having more knowledge) and social motivation (i.e., having more social support), and may be associated with personal motivation (i.e., having favorable attitudes/beliefs), but was not associated with adherence-related behavioral skills (i.e. having more self-efficacy), actual medication adherence, or A1C. Health literacy-appropriate interventions should aim to improve patients’ adherence-related knowledge and social support, as studies have consistently shown both factors are strong determinants of self-efficacy, which is amongst the strongest determinants of medication adherence behavior, and medication adherence affects glycemic control.

Glycemic control and anti-diabetic medication usage in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in an inner-city primary care practice Stephanie Chan (University of Maryland School of Medicine), Hsin-Chieh "Jessica" Yeh, PhD, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
Approximately 11 million people aged 65 years and older in the United States have diabetes mellitus (DM). Yet, the optimal glycemic target for elders with type 2 DM is uncertain, since most of the clinical trials were conducted largely in the middle-aged population. In early 2013, the American Geriatric Society recommended that the glycemic target for elders with type 2 DM change from a previous recommendation of HbA1c of <7% to a less stringent 7.5-8%. As such, millions of older adults may be able to simplify their drug regimens to reduce risks of hypoglycemia, polypharmacy, and geriatric syndrome. We analyzed data from East Baltimore Medical Center (EBMC) to characterize glycemic control and drug usage by older inner-city adults and quantify the potential implications from a less stringent glycemic target. In 2011, 519 adults aged 65 and older with type 2 DM were seen at EBMC: mean age 73.4 (SD, 6.8); 29% men, 96% African Americans, and mean body mass index 32.3 (7.5) kg/m2. The mean HbA1c was 7.1 (SD: 1.5); 58% of the patients had an A1C value of <7%. 34% of diabetic elders were on medications with an A1C <7%; 9% were taking multiple anti-diabetic medications to achieve this HbA1c level. In addition, 9% of older adults who had a HbA1c level between 7.0% and 7.9% were taking more than one drug. If the glycemic target is raised to <8%, at least 18% of older patients at EBMC may be able to discontinue or reduce their anti-diabetic medication regimens, which could potentially translate to thousands of older adults simplifying their drug regimens in the U.S. and the world.

The role of kynurenine in human Embryonic Stem Cell pluripotency Kendl Sankary (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences), Henrik Sperber, Hannele Ruohola-Baker, University of Washington, Seattle, WA
Pancreatic β-Cells are damaged in both Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus through different mechanisms. In Type I diabetes, the immune system malfunctions, destroying healthy β-Cells early in life. In Type II diabetes, the overwhelming demand placed on β-Cells to produce insulin leads to β-Cell damage and destruction (Ashcroft et al. 2012). The development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from adult cells provides great therapeutic potential for replacing a patient’s lost or damaged β-Cells. Since a great deal of research is already in progress optimizing the differentiation of β-Cells (Pagliuca and Melton, 2013), we are focused on examining the stem cell population from which the β-Cells can be differentiated. Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) exist in two states of pluripotency, an earlier “naïve” state and a later “primed” state. Elf1 cells are a newly derived line of naïve hESCs that are more efficient at differentiating into the endoderm germ layer, which gives rise to pancreatic tissue, than their primed counterparts (Ware et al. in press). We are examining the metabolic pathway of kynurenine – a catabolite of tryptophan – in this naïve Elf1 cell line as well as in the primed H1 cell line to determine whether it plays a role in converting hESCs between the primed and naïve state. Through mass spectrometry, we found that kynurenine accumulates in primed hESCs. In cancer cells, kynurenine binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) increasing cancer cell motility and proliferation (Opitz et al. 2011). We hypothesize that kynurenine may play a similar role in stem cells, by binding to AHR and increasing the expression of a key developmental target gene of AHR, Embryonic Endoderm Development (EED1). To test this hypothesis, we measured EED1 expression levels in naïve and primed hESCs and found that EED1 expression was increased in primed ESCs. We also tested the effect of adding kynurenine directly to naïve cell media, expecting that it could push the naïve hESCs to a more primed state. After growing naïve hESCs in media with kynurenine we found increased levels of several markers of the primed state (IDO1 and EED1) providing preliminary data indicating that kynurenine can push cells toward the primed state. These results indicate the importance of the kynurenine metabolic pathway in hESC pluripotency and support the value of further research into whether alterations of this metabolite could be useful in creating more naïve iPSCs with greater therapeutic potential.

The food dyes tartrazine and sunset yellow augment the effect of corticosterone on the glucocorticoid receptor. George M. Ziegler (Rush Medical College), Robert M. Sargis, University of Chicago
In recent decades, the rate of diagnosed diabetes cases in the United States rose in parallel with the production volume of synthetic organic chemicals. With the connection between obesity and type 2 diabetes, recent research has examined the ability of these chemicals to disrupt metabolic signaling in adipose tissue. We looked at lipophilic food dyes with similar chemical properties to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists due to their potential to alter insulin sensitivity and adipocyte differentiation and proliferation. To do so, we transected 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with a GRE-luc reporter and treated the cells with various concentrations of commonly used food dyes alone and in the presence of the endogenous glucocorticoid corticosterone. At treatment concentrations ranging from 1nM to 100 uM, some of the food dyes induced a significant level of luminescence, which is indicative of GR activation. However, none of these levels were comparable to those generated by corticosterone. When treated with 100 uM of the dyes tartrazine or sunset yellow in combination with 10 uM of corticosterone, there were significantly higher levels of luminescence relative to cells treated with corticosterone alone. These higher levels of GR activation suggest that while each dye alone may not be a strong GR agonist, when present with endogenous corticosterone, certain food dyes may be able to interfere with normal adipocyte metabolism and alter insulin sensitivity.

Combined, pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, and azilsartan, an ARB, have more effect on the regression of glomerulosclerosis through both the PPARγ and AT receptor pathway. Manu Mysore (Louisiana Health Sciences Center School of Medicine – New Orleans), Keizo Matsushita, Haichun Yang, and Agnes B. Fogo, Vanderbilt University.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by glomerulosclerosis. PPARγ agonists and ARBs activate two different signaling pathways, PPARγ, a transcription factor, and AT1R/AT2R. Previous experiments have shown that both classes of drugs slow down the progression of glomerulosclerosis. To test the hypothesis that pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, and azilsartan, an ARB, in combination could have a greater benefit to decrease the progression of glomerulosclerosis, we tested this combination in the 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) model of CKD. We started treatment 8 weeks after 5/6 Nx. We assessed body weight, glucose level, blood pressure, proteinuria, and creatinine clearance at weeks 0,8, and 12 and glomerulosclerosis index, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression level, podocyte count (WT-1), macrophage count (ED-1), collagen accumulation, AT1 and AT2 receptor expression, and PPARγ activity in both biopsy (week 8) and autopsy (week 12) adult male Sprague Dawley rat tissue samples. Four treatment groups, randomized with equal starting sclerosis, were determined as follows: Vehicle – untreated rats (n=7), TAK-497 – Azilsartan, 3mg/kg in DW (n=6), Pio – Pioglitazone, 2.5mg/kg in DW (n=7), and TAK/Pio – Azilsartan and Pioglitazone (n=7). At autopsy, the combined treatment group (TAK/Pio) had the lowest blood pressure and glomerulosclerosis level which links to lower PAI-1 and AT1 expression. Podocyte density was the highest in the combination therapy group (TAK/Pio) indicating the highest levels of renoprotection. PPARγ activity was also in the combination therapy group (TAK/Pio). Thus, PPARγ agonists and ARBs have more of an effect on the regression of glomerulosclerosis when used in combination than when used individually. Our data supports that these effects are mediated by increased PPARγ activity and decreased AT receptor pathway.

Effects of leptin receptor signaling in AgRP Neurons on Neuronal Activity and AgRP Expression Ololade S. Longe (University of Texas Medical Branch), James P. Warne, and Allison W. Xu, University of California San Francisco
Activation of Agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons in response to decreased leptin levels is an important adaptive response to starvation, but other leptin-independent signals could also be involved. The goal of this summer research project was to understand how AgRP expression and neuronal activity are regulated by leptin, and the underlying signaling mechanisms. Mice were generated in which leptin receptor is specifically deleted in AgRP neurons. Hypothalamic sections from these mice were then prepared, and immunofluorescence analyses were carried out to examine expressions of cfos, AgRP and several signaling pathways. Data obtained from these experiments has displayed evidence that leptin does not directly affect the activation of AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus, hinting that perhaps other hormones or chemicals in the body are involved in this activation. The experiments performed this summer have provided some level of insight into leptin regulation of AgRP neurons under normal physiologic conditions and helped provide understanding of its dysregulation in obesity.

A Look at Hepatic Gene Expression in a Diet-Induced Obesity Mouse Model DeAsia D. Gilmer (Howard University College of Medicine), Katherine Beckwith-Fickas, Fredric Wondisford, and Sally Radovick, Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, Baltimore, MD 21287
Untreated prediabetes has a high risk of developing into type 2 diabetes and its associated defective carbohydrate metabolism, decreased insulin secretion, and increased insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is most commonly treated with the oral antihyperglycemic drug metformin, which increases insulin sensitivity and suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis. The hormone betatrophin induces β cell proliferation and increases plasma insulin levels in genetically engineered obese and diabetic mice, suggesting a possible therapy for type 2 diabetes by increasing β cell mass. We hypothesized that liver, white adipose, and brown adipose tissue betatrophin expression would be increased in mice on a highfat diet and with increased age and obesity. In addition, mice on a high-fat diet treated with metformin were expected to have lower levels of betatrophin because of increased insulin sensitivity. The gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were expected to be increased in mice on a high-fat diet. A Diet-Induced Obesity (DIO) mouse model was used to study betatrophin expression in 12- and 22-week old mice. Metformin was administered to DIO mice at doses of 12.5 mg/kg body weight (n=6), 25 mg/kg body weight (n=7), and 50 mg/kg body weight (n=6). The levels of hepatic and visceral white adipose tissue betatrophin expression were significantly lower in 22-week old DIO mice. In peripheral white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue, betatrophin expression did not significantly differ in DIO mice. This may suggest a role in the pathogenesis of T2D; decreased betatrophin and β cell mass could lead to the problems associated with T2D. PEPCK expression in liver tissue was significantly increased in 12-week old DIO mice and significantly decreased in 22-week old DIO mice. G6Pase expression was not significantly different in DIO mice. Administration of metformin is ongoing and gene expression will be analyzed. Future studies will replicate these experiments and confirm betatrophin and gluconeogenic enzyme expression trends.

MicroRNA-495 regulates the expression of the β-cell apoptotic factor, TP53INP1. Presley Garrison (Brody School of Medicine – East Carolina University), Vasumathi Kameswaran, Klaus H. Kaestner, Perelman School of Medicine University of Pennsylvania
DLK1-MEG3, an imprinted microRNA (miRNA) cluster on human chromosome 14q32 is under expressed in insulin-producing β-cells of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) pancreatic islets when compared to non-T2DM control islets. In order to elucidate the significance of this misregulation to T2DM pathogenesis, the targets of the 54 miRNAs encoded by the 14q32 locus were identified using high throughput sequencing of cross-linked and immunoprecipitated RNA (HITS-CLIP) of Argonaute (Ago). MiR-495, a member of the 14q32 miRNA cluster, has been shown to regulate important transcription factors in the developing pancreas. A pro-apoptotic factor, p53-Induced Nuclear Protein 1 (TP53INP1), was identified as a miR-495 target. We hypothesize that expression of TP53INP1 increases when the associated miRNA, miR-495, is knocked-down. This increase in expression results in increased β-cell apoptosis and failure, thus contributing to T2DM pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we cloned a Tough Decoy (TuD) against miR-495, which sequestered mature miRNA in the cytoplasm through complementary base pairing, thereby allowing for de-repression of target mRNAs. Here we show that transfection of the Hela cells with the anti-miR-495 TuD construct successfully resulted in a two-fold increase in expression of TP53INP1 mRNA, but not protein. Additionally, we cloned this construct into a lentiviral backbone to enable similar studies in human islets. In summary, we have validated that TP53INP1 is a target of the 14q32 miRNA, miR-495, as predicted by HITS-CLIP in human islets. Thus, decreased expression of miR-495 results in increased expression of apoptotic factors like TP53INP1, which can exacerbate β-cell failure and apoptosis. This provides insight into a novel mechanism by which miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM.

Silk-mediated Delivery of BMP7 to White Fat Leads to Browning and Increased Energy Expenditure Elvis Espero (Univeristy of Kansas School of Medicine), Young-Mi Kwon, Kristy L. Townsend, Matthew D. Lynes, Jeannine Colburn, Eleanor Pritchard, David Kaplan, Yu-Hua Tseng; Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center & Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA USA
Obesity is currently a global pandemic, and results from an energy imbalance whereby energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. Excess energy is stored in white adipose tissue (WAT), which is characterized by adipocytes with a single, large lipid droplet. By contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is characterized by multilocular lipid droplets, numerous mitochondria, and dense innervation by the sympathetic nervous system and vasculature. BAT also uniquely expresses uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), allowing the tissue to undergo thermogenesis. Overall, these qualities make BAT a tissue capable of undergoing high levels of energy expenditure, and make it an appealing target for obesity therapies. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) is part of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) super-family of growth and developmental factors, and our laboratory has implicated BMP7’s involvement in 1) brown adipogenesis from committed and uncommitted progenitor cells; 2) increasing mitochondrial activity of mature brown adipocytes in vitro; and 3) increasing energy expenditure and decreasing appetite in mice. This makes BMP7 an enticing therapeutic option for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic conditions. However, BMP7 treatment carries the risk of bonedevelopment if delivered to certain anatomical locations and if coupled with cell damage. Thus, we sought a way to deliver BMP7 specifically to WAT in order to induce tissue-resident progenitor cells to differentiate to energy-expending brown adipocytes without off-target effects such as bone-formation. This process of inducing brown adipogenesis in WAT is termed ‘browning’ and occurs during coldexposure to provide additional cells for thermogenesis. Therefore, to deliver BMP7 to WAT, we utilized a silk scaffold consisting of a hydrogel carrying BMP7 encapsulated in silk microspheres. Silk scaffolds such as this have previously been used for BMP2-treatments, and silk is non-immunogenic. The silk has been engineered to obtain desirable release kinetics in order to mimic our in vitro differentiation studies. We have found that injection of this BMP7-loaded silk to the subcutaneous WAT of mice results in ‘browning’, including the development of multilocular, UCP1-positive brown adipocytes, and an increase in whole-body energy expenditure. Current studies are aimed at utilizing BMP7-loaded silk in obese mice to reverse body weight.

Assessment of sudomotor function as a predictor of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Ashley M. Schinske, BSN (University of Michigan Medical School); Mamta Jaiswal Ph.D. and Rodica Pop-Busui M.D., Ph.D., Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetes, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI
Regulation of cardiovascular and sudomotor function is largely controlled by the autonomic nervous system via the small, unmyelinated C-fibers. In diabetes, damage to these fibers can cause changes in sudomotor function and a serious complication called cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). To test the hypothesis that changes in sudomotor function will be an early predictor of CAN, we evaluated its association with standard CAN assessment measures in a cohort of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) patients. A total of 15 TIDM patients and 4 healthy controls were evaluated for CAN using standard cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests and analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Sudomotor function was assessed as electrochemical sweat conductance (ESC) in the hands and feet, using a SUDOSCAN® (Impeto Medical; Paris, France). Feet ESC, as assessed by the SUDOSCAN®, was not significantly different between the subjects with TIDM and healthy volunteers (79 ±8 µS and 80 ±9 µS; respectively, p=0.74). Similarly, the hand sudomotor function was not significantly different as both study groups had a mean hand ESC of 69 ±10 µS (p= 0.95). This preliminary data showed no significant correlation between the hand or feet ESC and any of the HRV measures. In this crosssectional pilot study cohort, no associations were found between sudomotor function and measures of CAN. This study is ongoing, evaluating 50 T1DM and healthy controls, who will be longitudinally followed over 3 years. Further evaluation at the conclusion of the study may reveal significant findings.

EPO expression in renal interstitial cells can be characterized via RNA in situ hybridization. Andrew Pfaff (Indiana University School of Medicine), Hanako Kobayashi, Volker Haase, Vanderbilt University
The HIFs control the adult renal response to hypoxia by increasing the expression of EPO by renal interstitial cells, inducing erythropoiesis. In chronic kidney disease, fibrosis results from proliferating interstitial cells, yet EPO production is diminished, causing a renal-based anemia. To investigate this, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from adult mouse kidneys were examined for their EPO expression profile using the novel RNA in situ hybridization technology RNAScope®. We hypothesized that in the adult kidney, EPO expression will be localized to the interstitium rather than the endothelium and that the population of interstitial cells expressing EPO will increase with hypoxia. Wild-type mice were compared to a genetic model of hypoxia, which was created via Cre-Lox recombination by deleting the HIF inhibitor EGLN1. In wild-type mice, EPO expression was localized to the interstitium and was minimal. In the Egln1 -/- model, EPO expression appeared to be elevated selectively in the interstitium, but this could not be validated due to high background signal. Further optimization of RNAScope for FFPE tissues is needed to characterize the mutant model. RNAScope is currently being adapted for use with cell suspension in hopes of combining it with fluorescenceactivated cell sorting. In the future, this will allow us to examine the Foxd1 interstitial cell population in isolation and characterize its EPO expression in health and disease.

Type 1 diabetes self-management: Adherence to blood sugar monitoring and record keeping among adolescents with attention problems. Racquel Wells (University of Massachusetts Medical School), Ellen O’Donnell, Lynne Levitsky, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School
Adherence to Type 1 Diabetes regimens declines in adolescence. Patients with symptoms related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are more likely to have poor organizational and attentive skills and therefore may be less adherent to their diabetes regimen. Inattention and ADHD symptoms may be related specifically to poorer blood sugar monitoring and record keeping. Twenty-six adolescents (12 and over) and their parents completed the Diabetes Behavior Rating Scale and Conners’ Rating Scale questionnaires. Self-reported responses were analyzed for correlations between adherence to blood glucose monitoring and record keeping and inattention and ADHD-risk behavior of adolescent patients. Mean parent report of adherence was significantly lower for patients ≥ 12 than for patients < 12. Parents and patients responded similarly to questions on frequency of monitoring and record keeping. There was a significant correlation between reporting of monitoring at recommended and expected times and parent reported behavior of inattention and ADHD risk. Rates of record keeping were low among all patients, regardless of inattention/ADHD risk. Physicians should focus on identifying adolescents that are at a higher risk of poorer adherence due to attention problems. Screening should include specific questions related to adherence. Measuring adherence to specific self-management practices in adolescents is a benefit to calculating and maintaining their standard of care. Future studies may utilize more “real time” measures of adherence, as opposed to record keeping, such as electronic reporting and 24-hour recall to compare with self-reporting.

CTRP Metabolic Signaling and Expression in the Brain. Lauren Evans (University of Oklahoma College of Medicine), Pia S. Petersen, Ph.D., G. William Wong, Ph.D., Center for Metabolism and Obesity Research, Johns Hopkins Medical Institution.
Adipocytes release “adipokines,” such as Leptin and Adiponectin, through which adipose tissue can act as an endocrine organ, hormonally controlling metabolism and regulating satiety. Adiponectin is closely related to a family of cytokines called C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs), which are all believed to have metabolic effects. We hypothesized that CTRP9, CTRP12, and Myonectin (CTRP15) were all expressed in the hypothalamus and we would be able to observe regulation during different metabolic states. We also hypothesized that these cytokines may have effects on metabolically relevant signaling pathways in hypothalamic neurons. To test our first hypothesis we performed Real-time PCR on hypothalamic tissues from mice that had been exposed to various metabolic states (Ad Libitum Fed, Fasted, or Fasted and Re-Fed). To test our second hypothesis we exposed a hypothalamic neuronal cell line (N38) that had been serum starved to either CTRP9, CTRP12, or one of our control solutions for either 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes and then performed Western Blot analysis with antibodies targeting metabolically relevant signaling pathways. CTRP12 and Myonectin were both found to be significantly upregulated in the hypothalamus during the fasted state, while CTRP9 showed no regulation under fasted or re-fed conditions. This regulation suggests that CTRP12 and Myonectin have an effect within the hypothalamus during fasting. Also, hypothalamic neuronal cells treated with CTRP9 or CTRP12 for 15 minutes were found to both down-regulate AMPK and MAPK phosphorylation. This data indicates that CTRP9 and CTRP12 could play a similar role to Leptin, which down-regulates AMPK in order to inhibit appetite.

Trust in Physicians and Its Link to Intermediate Diabetic Outcomes Andrew S. Wilson1, BS; Yulia Khodneva2 , MD PhD; Susan Andreae2 , MPH; Monika Safford1, MD; Andrea Cherrington2, MD MPH University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine
Trust in your physician as previously been linked to better glycemic control. We examined the relationship between general trust in physicians and diabetic outcomes as measured through blood pressure and glycemic control (A1c). This is a secondary data analysis using cross-sectional data from a community-based trial. Patients were mostly African Americans with diabetes living in southern, rural Alabama. Face-to-face interviews by a trained interviewer assessed general trust in physicians using a previously validated instrument (TMP-11). HbA1c and blood pressure were measured at baseline using a standardized protocol. Categorical variables were compared using chi square tests. Continuous variables were compared using bivariate linear regression. Multivariable analyses included general linear regression models adjusted for gender, income, education, insulin use, medication adherence, number of ambulatory visits, perceived discrimination, and depressive symptoms. 418 patients provided information for the trust scale (6 were missing). Mean age was 59, 75% were female and 87% were African American. High Trust (TMP > 30) was associated with older age, less perceived discrimination, and lower medication adherence. In bivariate analyses, hemoglobin A1c (p=0.26) and mean blood pressure (p=0.64) showed no significant association with provider trust. Multivariate adjusted analysis of both A1c and mean blood pressure again showed no association with general trust in physicians. General trust in physicians was not associated with change in glycemic control or blood pressure at follow-up in either unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Though it did not reach statistical significance, higher general trust was associated with higher systolic blood pressure. Future research should further explore these relationships.

High density lipoproteins and serum triglycerides may be associated with colorectal adenomas. John-Anthony Coppola (Florida State University College of Medicine), Martha J. Shrubsole, Qiuyin Cai, Walter E. Smalley, Qi Dai, Reid M. Ness, Wei Zheng, Harvey J. Murff, Vanderbilt University, Nashville Tennessee.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer worldwide and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Many factors that have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenoma may be associated with the metabolic syndrome, such as abdominal obesity, elevated fasting glucose, and possibly dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, lowered high density lipoproteins (HDL)). In this study, we hypothesize that individuals identified with colorectal adenomas will have increased triglyceride levels and decreased HDL levels compared to those with no history of colorectal adenomas. This study included 403 polyp-free controls, 467 non-advanced colorectal adenoma cases and 238 advanced colorectal adenoma cases from the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study, a large colonoscopy based case-control study. Non-advanced and advanced adenoma cases had decreased HDL levels (40.2 ± 12.2 mg/dL, 38.8 ± 10.8 mg/dL, respectively) compared to the control group (44.0 ± 13.8 mg/dL, p<0.001) and increased triglyceride levels (162.2 ± 81.5 mg/dL, 168.6 ± 95.8 mg/dL, respectively) compared to control groups (145.3 ± 90.2 mg/dL, p<0.002). Individuals in the highest quartile for HDL levels compared with the lowest quartiles had an odds ratio of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.70) for non-advanced adenomas and 0.21 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.40) for advanced adenomas. Individuals in the highest quartile for triglyceride levels compared with the lowest quartiles had an odds ratio of 1.91 (95% CI: 1.20, 3.03) for non-advanced adenomas and 2.67 (95% CI: 1.49, 4.79) for advanced adenomas. We found that individuals with lower HDL levels and higher triglyceride levels are associated with an increased risk for developing both advanced and non-advanced colorectal adenomas.

Pyridorin – Bringing a Novel Treatment for Diabetic Nephropathy from Bench to Bedside Samat Kabani (Medical College of Georgia), Mohammed Sika, Julia Lewis, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN
Diabetic nephropathy affects 33% of all patients with Diabetes and is the most common cause of EndStage Renal Disease, with 40% of diabetic patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Pyridorin (pyridoxamine (PM) dihydrochloride) is a crystalline amine (C8H12N2O2) that has demonstrated a significant treatment effect in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetes in three Phase II clinical trials. The objectives of this research include understanding in detail the “bench to bedside” process of getting a drug like Pyridorin to the public market while modifying & revising Phase III Pyridorin protocol pertaining to run-in periods for re-submission to the FDA. Research results conclude that bringing a drug like Pyridorin from “bench to bedside” is projected to take ~22 years (1996 to 2018) with a cost of nearly $500M and >2000 patients/animals. In addition, a modified definition of run-in periods should be included in the Pyridorin’s Phase III protocol to increase overall patient recruitment.

Urothelial cytokeratin response to inflammatory bladder injury Daniel L. Lara1, Christina B. Ching2, Douglass B. Clayton2 1Crieghton University School of Medicine, 2 Division of Pediatric Urology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine
The urothelial response of the murine bladder to injury as it relates to cytokeratin expression has not been well characterized. Chronic bladder injury can lead to a variety of functional problems due to the alteration of the bladder wall. Recently, we identified alterations in urothelial cytokeratins in response to bladder injury using a model of partial bladder outlet obstruction and bladder distension. Proteins have been shown to be upregulated during bladder injury particularly cytokeratin 14 (CK14) and cytokeratin 6 (CK6). We hypothesized that a purely inflammatory injury to the bladder will cause the urothelial cells to upregulate their expression of cytokeratins 14 and 6. In order to test our hypothesis we instilled 50 microliters of E.Coli 05:B55 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a concentration of 400micrograms/mL for 60 minutes in the bladders of female ovariecteomized C57Bl/6 mice. Control mice were instilled with 50 microliters of sterile saline. 24 hours after the acute injury, we sacrificed both groups of mice and employed different staining techniques to observe the effects LPS on the urothelial cytokeratin expression and on inflammatory infiltrate. Based on H&E staining, bladders instilled with LPS demonstrated acute inflammation, marked by subepithelial edema and accumulation of neutrophils. Control bladders instilled with saline showed little to no inflammation. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining revealed that CK 14 was upregulated in the bladders that were instilled with LPS and was not upregulated in the bladders that were instilled with saline. IF staining also showed that the expression of CK 6 was unaffected by the instillation of LPS or saline. These results suggest that the instillation of LPS can stimulate an inflammatory response in the urothelium that leads to the increased expression of CK 14. These results were consistent with other forms of bladder injury such as distension and bladder outlet obstruction, but provide evidence that changes associated with cytokeratin expression are not dependent upon physical effects of the injury model.

Insights into the Mechanism of Action of a Potential Drug for the Treatment of Adrenocortical Carcinoma Fatima A. Ballout, B.S. (Wayne State University School of Medicine), Veronica Burns Ph.D., Tom Kerppola Ph.D., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, and highly malignant type of cancer with a poor prognosis and few treatment options. ATR-101 is an orphan drug that was originally intended to lower cholesterol levels in the treatment of atherosclerosis. However, ATR101 resulted in adrenal toxicity, and thus is now being developed for the treatment of ACC. Currently, the only known target of ATR-101 is Acyl-CoA Cholesterol Acyltransferase (ACAT), an intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the esterification of free cholesterol. Previous studies reported adrenal toxicity in ACAT knockout mice fed a high cholesterol diet, indicating that ACAT activity is essential for adrenal cell viability in the presence of high cholesterol. To test the hypothesis that ATR-101 induces adrenal toxicity by increasing intracellular free cholesterol levels, we examined the effect of a cholesterol-chelating agent, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), on human ACC (H295R) cell viability. H295R cells were incubated with varying concentrations of ATR-101 and MβCD for 4 hours and 24 hours. After incubation, we performed SYTOX and ATP assays as separate measures of cell viability. MβCD (1-1.5mM) was found to protect H295R cells from ATR-101-mediated cytotoxicity both 4 hours and 24 hours after drug treatment. To further examine the effect of MβCD on ATR-101, the expression of cholesterol responsive genes (CHOP, LDLR, IDOL, ABCG1, HMGCR) was analyzed in the presence of ATR-101, MβCD, and ATR-101 together with MβCD. Consistent with the protective effect of MβCD on cell viability in the presence of ATR-101, the induction of the stress response gene, CHOP, by ATR-101 was reversed in the presence of MbCD. MβCD induced cholesterol-repressed genes, LDLR and HMGCR, in either the absence or presence of ATR-101, indicating that MβCD lowered intracellular cholesterol levels. Furthermore, in either the presence or absence of MβCD, ATR-101 inhibited LXR target genes, ABCG1 and IDOL, indicating that MβCD does not block entry of ATR-101 into the cell. Together, this is consistent with the hypothesis that MβCD counteracts ATR-101 toxicity by lowering intracellular cholesterol levels. Gaining a better understanding of the mechanism(s) of adrenal toxicity by ATR-101 is critical for the development of an ATR-101 therapy for ACC and in the design of alternative ACC drugs.

Accurate Estimation of Total Daily Caloric Needs: A Comparison of Mifflin to Sabounchi Predictive Equations Laura Hoffman (University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix), Susan Melhorn, Vidhi Tyagi, Mary Webb, Carolyn Noonan, Holly Callahan, Ellen Schur, University of Washington
The ability to accurately estimate daily caloric needs across a range of body types is critical for research that compares appetite regulation among lean and obese individuals. While the equations proposed by Mifflin et al. are currently considered the “gold standard” for estimating basal metabolic rate (BMR) for the general population, Sabounchi et al. has recently published a set of age- and racespecific equations for estimating BMR. We hypothesized that the Sabounchi equations would provide better estimates such that the sub-populations reporting less fullness after meals would have BMR values that were underestimated by the Mifflin equation, in comparison to the estimation by the applicable Sabounchi equation. To assess hunger and fullness, we collected visual analog scale (VAS) scores from adult subjects enrolled in a twin study of appetite regulation. VAS ratings occurred before and after meals designed to provide a specific percent of the twins’ daily caloric needs, as predicted by the Mifflin equation. Hunger and fullness VAS scores were compared to assess standardization of fullness between groups following each meal. The daily caloric needs estimated by both the Mifflin and Sabounchi equations were compared between groups and to VAS data. There were no significant differences in hunger or fullness VAS scores by sex or BMI category. There was a significant effect of race on differences between Mifflin and Sabounchi predictions (P< 0.0001). In comparing the Mifflin and Sabounchi predictions for total daily kilocalories to total daily kilocalories consumed during the study, the Sabounchi equations generated a better fit in a linear regression model (R2 = 0.33, R2 = 0.48, respectively). There were no significant differences in the average post-snack VAS fullness score between subjects for whom the Mifflin equation underestimated or overestimated BMR relative to the Sabounchi prediction, though there was a trend in which subjects in the underestimation group reported lower average post-snack VAS fullness scores (38.6±23.1mm) and subjects in the overestimation group reported higher average fullness scores (53.3±21.8 mm). These results suggest that, in research of appetite regulation among a racially diverse population, the BMR prediction equations published by Sabounchi et al. may be more appropriate than the Mifflin equations.

Terminating Type 1 Diabetes with Enhanced CD8 Regulatory T Cells. Elizabeth A. Ockerman (University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Medicine), Blair T. Stocks, Chris S. Wilson, Andrew F. Marshall, and Daniel J. Moore. Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from aberrant interactions between autoreactive T and B cells that lead to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. While numerous therapies have attempted to quell this autoreactivity by targeting either B cells or T cells individually, none have successfully restored tolerance long term. It is now known that healthy individuals normally restrain T cell-B cell interactions to prevent autoimmunity through the actions of newly described CD8 regulatory T cells (CD8 Tregs). I hypothesized that CD8 Tregs fail to maintain self tolerance in Type 1 diabetes due to deficiency in critical signals for their activation and survival. CD8 Tregs were assessed numerically by flow cytometry in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the primary pre-clinical model of T1D. Their response to the survival factor IL-15 was assessed by ex vivo culture with a superagonist (10ng/mL) and by measurement of IL15R signaling with phosphoflow cytometry. The biological function of CD8 Tregs was determined in an adoptive transfer experiment. NOD CD8 Tregs were found to decrease in an age-dependent manner and were 25-fold reduced compared to B6 by 16 weeks of age (p<0.0001 by two-way ANOVA). These cells failed to expand robustly when stimulated with IL-15 survival signal (20-fold increase in B6 CD8 Tregs; 3-fold increase in NOD CD8 Tregs). We attributed this failure to decreased Lyn signaling following IL-15 stimulation in NOD CD8 Tregs (B6 MFI=1372; NOD MFI= 607.5). This decreased signaling related to enhanced phosphatase activity in NOD mice, perhaps relating to a T1D-associated polymorphism in PTPN22. Importantly, CD8 Tregs were competent to regulate the immune response in NOD mice when provided in a physiologic ratio, suggesting that, if adequately expanded, they may represent an effective cellular therapy to halt the immune response in T1D and permit islet beta cell replenishment.

Diabetes Connect: African American Men’s Perceptions of the Community Health Worker Model for Diabetes Care Krysia Crabtree (Eastern Virginia Medical School), Nathan Sherrer, Tullia Rushton, Amanda Willig, PhD, April Agne, MPH, Andrea Cherrington, MD UAB School of Medicine
Background: African Americans are disproportionately affected by the diabetes epidemic, with higher prevalence and diabetes-related complications compared with non-Hispanic whites. Increasingly, the community health worker (CHW) model has been implemented in an effort to improve health outcomes in underserved populations. While promising, interventions to date are more likely to attract female participants. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore how African American men living with type 2 diabetes perceive potential benefits and risks of community health worker-delivered diabetes management programs. Methods: Four ninety-minute focus groups were guided by a trained moderator with a written guide to facilitate discussion on the topic of community health workers (CHWs) and diabetes management. Participants were recruited from the diabetes education database at a local safety-net health system in Birmingham, AL. Two independent reviewers performed content analysis to identify major themes using an iterative, combined deductive and inductive approach. Results: There were 25 male participants. Mean years living with diabetes was 9.6 (range 1-20). Participants demonstrated knowledge of self-management strategies and identified various hardships including emotional and physical manifestations of diabetes, dietary restrictions and non-adherence, and institutional frustrations with the medical system that contributed to self-management barriers. Participants preferred CHWs be relatable and knowledgeable about diabetes. Preferred CHW duties were to educate, facilitate support groups, provide coaching on daily activities, and link to resources. Potential concerns regarding CHWs included confidentiality and condescension. The participants also discussed the importance of family-focused support dynamics. Conclusions: Participants identified critical self-management strategies but endure hardships that present barriers to achieving these methods. Many of the strategies and barriers to self-management that participants identified mirrored their preferred CHW duties and traits. Results from this study suggest that African American men in Alabama would participate in and benefit from a communitydelivered diabetes management program.

Disruption of normal feeding schedule alters energy metabolism Kyra Jefferson-George (Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania), Laura Scolaro, Ph.D., Xiaoyan Yin, M.D., Rexford Ahima, M.D., Ph.D., Institute for Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania
The time of day during which food is consumed influences energy homeostasis.1 The mistiming of food intake which occurs, for example, with shift work may adversely affect energy metabolism and contribute to diseases such as obesity and metabolic syndrome.2 To model the feeding schedule of a shift worker, C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet ad libitum (LD), or feeding was restricted to the light (L) or dark (D) periods. Since mice are primarily nocturnal, we hypothesized that L-fed mice will develop abnormal energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. After 4 weeks, the cumulative food intake was lower in L-fed mice (300.59 kcal) compared to D-fed (356.24 kcal, p < 0.001) and LD-fed (348.62 kcal, p < 0.01), but L-fed mice had similar body weight, fat and lean mass compared to D-fed and LD-fed mice. Oxygen consumption was significantly lower in L-fed mice than D-fed and LD-fed mice. The profiles for blood glucose, liver glycogen, and lipids were also different in L-fed mice as compared to D-fed mice. L-fed mice also had an exaggerated insulin response to feeding. These data suggest that disrupting the normal feeding schedule in mice alters energy metabolism, decreases energy expenditure, and causes insulin resistance, which may predispose to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effects of restricted feeding on organ-specific energy metabolism.

A Unique Look at Integrins' Role in Collecting Duct Injury Phillip Gary (Drexel University College of Medicine), Olga Viquez, Ph.D, Roy Zent, MD, Ph.D, Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN
Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors for extracellular matrix components known to play a role in kidney development, function, and disease. To investigate the hypothesis that deletion of the α3 integrin subunit and subsequent loss of integrin α3β1 leads to increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis and collecting duct dilatation, transgenic knockout mice were developed. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were conducted at various time points following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO). Preliminary trichrome staining showed an increase in tubulointerstitial fibrosis in α3 knockout kidneys compared to control kidneys after 7 days UUO. Western Blot analysis of papillary and medullary tissue showed increased collagen I expression after 5 and 7 days UUO as compared to control. These results have implications regarding congenital kidney disease and can potentially lead to a better understanding of normal α3β1 integrin function in kidney epithelial cells.

Prior use of the built environment predicts continued use of the built environment for routine family physical activity. Meredith Newton (University of Virginia School of Medicine), William J. Heerman, M.D., Shari L. Barkin, M.D., M.S.H.S., Vanderbilt University
Families play an integral role in setting healthy lifestyle expectations. For example, children of active parents are up to 6 times more likely to be active themselves. Therefore, any obesity preventive programs need to include the family and start early in childhood. This study examined: 1) physical activity programming preferences of parents and their preschool-aged children; and 2) predictors of actual attendance of physical activity programs in recreation centers. Participants of the study were low-income, minority parent-child dyads (child aged 3-5 years) living in or frequenting areas near designated community recreation centers in Nashville, TN. In this study we developed and administered a survey (n=32) to collect data on participants’ process and content preferences for parent-preschool-aged child physical activity programming. Also, we performed a step-wise analysis to assess what factors predicted parent and child attendance at ongoing monthly community events (n=33). We found that parents and their preschool-aged children prefer 60-minute long fitness classes, dance/movement classes, and family swim times on Tuesdays and Saturdays from 4:00-8:00pm, and they are willing to spend up to $5 to participate. Predictors of actual attendance of physical activity programming in the community recreation center included attending prior sessions that took place in that setting. In fact, every one additional face-to-face session attended resulted in participants being 1.61 times more likely to attend a monthly community event. However, fifteen of the nineteen demographic, previous attendance, physical activity, and built environment perception factors studied were not significant in predicting monthly community event attendance. These results suggest that familiarizing families with active use of their existing built environment can lead to increased utilization of their built environment for routine physical activity.

Altered brain activity in type II diabetes – implications for cognition. Sarah E. Foote (Tulane University School of Medicine), Thomas J. Marder, Gail Musen, Joslin Diabetes Center
An increasing volume of literature indicates that type II diabetes is a risk factor for a range of neurological complications, including deficits in cognition and dementia. Research conducted in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients has indicated that aberrant deactivation of regions within the default mode network (DMN) may serve as one of the earliest signs of AD onset. To test the hypothesis that type II diabetics would exhibit similar patterns of neurological activity within the DMN, we used fMRI to analyze activation and deactivation patterns during a recognition task. The recognition task performed in the MRI scanner was split into two stages; during the encoding stage patients were presented with colored images, while during the recognition stage patients were presented with the same image series and asked to indicate by the press of a button whether the images had previously presented in red or green. We used the FSL software package to perform general linear model multiple regressions comparing activation and deactivation patterns between subject cohorts during the recognition task relative to rest. We controlled for age during the final fMRI regression analysis; cohorts were well matched with respect to other potentially confounding variables such as IQ, task performance, and presence of the ApoE4 allele. Relative to T2DM subjects, controls exhibited significantly greater deactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the caudate nucleus during the recognition task; T2DM patients exhibited greater activation than controls within the same regions. In conclusion, the T2DM subjects in our cohort exhibited altered patterns of brain activity similar to that seen in AD patients, demonstrating persistent activation of the ACC, a key region of the DMN, during a cognitive task. The relative deactivation observed in the caudate nucleus of control subjects is likely a reflection of hyperactivation of the caudate among T2DM subjects, which may be a compensatory mechanism used to preserve cognitive function in the absence of DMN deactivation. These observations have implications for the identification of pre-clinical biomarkers of cognitive decline in patients with T2DM.

Rescuing the blockade of wild-type proinsulin misfolding by mutant proinsulin via compounds similar to ERO1α holds promise in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Kathryn Higdon (Michigan State University College of Human Medicine), Ming Liu, Yi Xiong Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology, and Diabetes, University of Michigan
Misfolded mutant proinsulin causes a blockade in wild-type insulin release via intermolecular disulfide bonds, resulting in the dominant-negative behavior of diabetes pathologies as seen in the Akita mouse strain and certain types of human diabetes mellitus. Overexpression of the ERO1α gene has been shown to rescue this blockade of wild-type proinsulin misfolding. It is our hypothesis that compounds with similar properties to the sites of EROα1 protein crucial to rescuing this blockade hold potentially therapeutic effects. To test this hypothesis that these compounds may increase wild-type insulin production in the presence of mutant proinsulin, we cotransfected 293T cells with both mouse wild-type (mWT) and mouse Akita (mAK) insulin genes and chased samples in the presence of potential “rescue” compounds. Chased samples were labeled with the isotope S35 and separated by gel electrophoresis to analyze respective amounts of preproinsulin and proinsulin in samples with and without the “rescue” compounds. Compared to mWT transfected 293T cells, the cotransfected mWT + mAK 293Tcells show reduced proinsulin and elevated preproinsulin levels on gel electrophoresis. This illustrates that wildtype (pre)proinsulin folding is blockaded in the presence of a mutant proinsulin relative to wild-type proinsulin alone. Although experiments are still in progress, we expect that cotransfected mWT+mAK cells treated with ERO1α similar compounds will show varying elevations in proinsulin compared to the untreated cotransfected cells, but these levels remain lower than mWT proinsulin levels. We hope to show that the compounds that rescue the folding blockade in this mutant model, relatively rare among the causes of human diabetes pathology, will extend their ability to increase wild-type proinsulin folding to other causes of diabetes mellitus that also result from higher ratios of protein misfolding. Once we select the ERO1α-like compound with the greatest potential to protect wild-type proinsulin folding in the presence of mutants, we will test this compounds effects on β cells of diabetic mice with higher misfolding occurrence not caused by genetic mutation.

B-Catenin and K-ras synergize to form Wilm’s tumor with concurrent p53 pathway modulation. Austin Hembd, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Dr. Peter Clark, Dr. David DeGraff, Vanderbilt University.
Humans can develop pediatric kidney tumors called Wilm’s tumors. If one identifies the specific genes that cause Wilm’s tumor, or that concomitantly change expression levels in the tumor tissue, then diagnosis and eventually drug targets for therapy are expedited. Characterizing genetic determinants in the mouse model can help actualize these future therapies. When thegenes K-r as and β-Catenin are overexpressed in a mouse, it develops a renal tumorhistologically identical to a h uman Wilm’s tumor. Microarray analysis on mouse tumor tissueshowed modulated expression levels of gene targets in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.Immunohistochemistry stained mice tissue specifica lly for p53. In tissue with K-ras andβ-catenin overexpression, p53 staining is positive surrounding the tu mor. RT qPCR measuredlevels of gene expression of p53 pathway associated genes. Combination mut ants β-Cateninand Kras were compared with controls. This PCR array analysis identified genes, such a sc-Jun, Traf1, and Dapk1, that had significant expression changes in the combination mutantwhen com pared to either mutant individually. The expression is modulated in a non-additivefashion in K-ras + β-c atenin mutant tissues, which can explain the phenotype of Wilm’s tumor inonly double mutant mice. Th ese genes individually represent targets for therapy in the future,and together represent an identifying fi ngerprint for diagnosis and prediction.

Finding a Needle in a Haystack: Insights into Electronic Record System. Yaser Carcora (Wayne State University: School of Medicine), Annie Browning, MSHA, J. Bryan Byrd, MD, MSCI. University of Michigan Medical School.
In 2011, the University of Michigan introduced MiChart, an electronic health record(EHR) as a tool to store patients’ medical information. In a pilot study, we evaluated the usefulness of MiChart using an electronic research alert (ERAs) as a tool for locating lean hypertensive patients to measure their plasma adrenal steroid levels. We wanted to assess whether the ERA’s was a useful tool for identifying this rare phenotype with the hope that the results would help us in modify the system for further use in Cardiovascular, Metabolic, and Diabetes Research. The criteria for a lean hypertensive participant was a male between the ages of 18-70 with a systolic blood pressure of over 140, or a diastolic blood pressure of over 90, or were taking anithyptertensive medications. Once filtered through the initial prescreen, our screening staff would then identify potential candidates for the clinical study. Of 660 patients identified by the ERA, 556 were excluded on the grounds of potentially-confounding comorbidities. Some patients diagnosed with HTN were taking a drug known or suspected to raise blood pressure or were found to have other characteristics suggestive of secondary hypertension. 44 patients were deemed eligible for participation of a blood draw. Thus far, 20 of the 44 eligible candidates have been contacted by mail, and 5 of these candidates have agreed to participate. This pilot study experience suggested additional exclusion criteria such as alcohol abuse, sympathetic overactivity, and adrenal tumors to be used in a future, larger study. Looking ahead, we are now working on a modified ERA that would trigger when a lean hypertensive patient schedules an appointment and hope that this modification would make it easier to recruit patients straight from the clinic.

Zebrafish betatrophin Expression is Induced by Insulin Resistance and Over Nutrition Rigoberto Leyva (Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences), Lisette A. Maddison, Wenbiao Chen, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University
Reduced insulin-producing pancreatic β-cell mass is a central feature of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Current pharmacological treatments and insulin injections cannot fully substitute for endogenous β-cell function to prevent hyperglycemia. Replacement or regeneration of β-cell mass is a potentially better therapeutic treatment. Research by Yi et al. identified betatrophin, a hormone that specifically increases β-cell mass in insulinresistant mouse models, raising hopes for regenerative β-cell therapy in humans. The uncertainty of the mechanism by which betatrophin induces pancreatic β-cell proliferation is the biggest obstacle for ongoing research. Based on sequence similarity, conserved synteny, and the detection of transcripts in adult liver-tissue we identified a zebrafish betatrophin ortholog (z-betatrophin). This research study aims to determine whether z-betatrophin is a functionally conserved zebrafish ortholog. The spatial and temporal dynamics of z-betatrophin expression during development was studied. Our results suggest that z-betatrophin is liver specific and its transcription begins 6 days post fertilization (dpf). In order to determine whether nutrition state or insulin resistance regulates z-betatrophin expression we studied 6 dpf embryos from wild type models and zebrafish muscle insulin resistance models (zMIR). Our results suggest z-betatrophin expression is stimulated by lipid rich nutrient and insulin resistance. In addition, we utilized a heat shock (hsp70l) regulated and a liver specific (fab10) transgenic constructs to study the effect of ectopic expression of z-betatrophin and h-betatrophin (human betatrophin) on pancreatic β-cell number of wild type models. Although, z-betatrophin did not have a significant effect, we observed a significant increase of pancreatic β-cell number in 6 dpf embryos with ectopic expression of h-Betatrophin. These results positively identify a functional betatrophin system in zebrafish, providing an in vivo platform to identification and functional characterization of Betatrophin signalling pathways.

Pancreatic islet cell osmotic fluctuations activate L-type Ca2+ channels, stimulating hormone secretion Toni M. Li (University of Oklahoma College of Medicine), Prasanna Dadi, David A. Jacobson, Dept. of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University
Alpha and beta cells of the pancreatic islet secrete the hormones glucagon and insulin, respectively, which play key roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Despite their opposite responses to glucose, both cell types depend on Ca2+ influx for hormone secretion. Because it has been shown that islet cell swelling accompanies elevations in concentration of extracellular glucose, we hypothesized that glucose-induced changes in islet cell shape affect Ca2+ entry and hormone secretion. Cell swelling and shrinkage were provoked by changing extracellular osmolarity and by ionic amphipathic molecules, chlorpromazine (CPZ) and picric acid (TNP), which preferentially insert into either the inner or outer monolayer of the plasma membrane and cause membrane curvature. Hormone secretions in the presence CPZ and TNP were quantified using an ELISA-based assay. A number of different channel inhibitors were used to elucidate specific channels involved in regulating Ca2+ activity. Based on our experiments, we found that both islet cell swelling and shrinkage activate mechanosensitive L-type Ca2+ channels in a depolarization-independent manner. Glucagon and insulin secretion are enhanced in both low and high glucose conditions in the presence of either CPZ or TNP. Experiments performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ showed that intracellular Ca2+ stores are released when cells undergo shrinkage. In conclusion, changes in islet cell volume and the resultant stress on the plasma membrane activate mechanosensitive L-type Ca2+ channels, stimulating hormone secretion.

The Effect of Nonsynonymous Mutations in Mtgr1and Mtg8 on Repression Capability Alexandra Lane (Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine), Wei Ning, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine
Myeloid Translocation Gene, Related Protein-1 (MTGR1) and Myeloid translocation Gene 8 (MTG8) are two members of a family of genes originally identified as the target of chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mtgr1 and Mtg8 function as transcriptional corepressors and serve as scaffolding proteins upon which other transcriptional repressors, histone deacetylases and transcription factors assemble. Nonsynonymous mutations in Mtg8 (P167T) and Mtgr1(P187T) have been identified in Human colon carcinoma by The Cancer Genome Project These mutations map to the NHR1 domain, a region important for repressor function. Specifically, this region is known to bind E-Box proteins and be involved in recruiting other components of the repression complex. We hypothesize that these mutations will reduce repression efficiency and result in regulatory deficits of target genes. To test this hypothesis we used site-directed mutagenesis to model the mutations in Mtgr1 and Mtg8 as GAL4 fusion proteins. We performed reporter assays using a GAL4-TK-Luciferase reporter to test for the global ability of the mutants to repress transcription. In order to assess whether the mutants affected more specific MTGregulated pathways we used the SuperTopFlash assay to evaluate their impact on WNT signaling. Sanger Sequencing confirmed that plasmids contained the desired mutations and successful protein expression was confirmed via immunoblotting. The Gal4 luciferase assay demonstrated the global repression ability of the Mtg8 and MtgR-1 proteins but did not show a statistically significant difference in repression between the mutant and wild type proteins. The SuperTopFlash assay is still ongoing but will offer more specific data on the effect of the mutation. This data overall suggests that the mutation sites do not interfere with the translation or the global repression ability of the protein. We hope to continue to work with these mutants and identify what functional deficits’ may lead to their role in human colon cancer.

Type I Diabetes Diagnosed in the Parents of Children with Type I Diabetes Lindsay Weiner (Georgetown University School of Medicine), Ellen Greenberg, MS, Robin Goland, MD, Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center
The majority of adult new onset cases of diabetes are largely classified as Type II diabetes (T2D), prompting the presumptive misdiagnosis of many patients that have Type I diabetes (T1D). Little is known about why some patients develop T1D at older ages compared to those who develop the disease in childhood and not much information is available about the diagnosis or course of T1D in a parent when one of their children is already diagnosed with T1D. Onset of T1D in adults seems to be associated with lower HbA1C and C-peptide levels and milder signs of metabolic decompensation compared to children. It is hypothesized that adults that have a child with T1D will present with less severe symptoms compared to their children and may be misdiagnosed with T2D. We performed a retrospective chart review of 26 patients, consisting of 13 parent-child pairs, in order to analyze age at diagnosis, ethnicity, gender, initial HbA1C, C-peptide level, personal and family history of autoimmunity, BMI, lipid profile, and presence of β-cell autoantibodies (GAD65, ICA). The average age of adults diagnosed with T1D was 44.6 ± 6 years (range 33-60). Children were diagnosed at a mean age of 9.0 ± 4.7 years (range 1-18), with 23% presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Children had an initial HbA1C of 9.6 ± 2.9% with an average C-peptide level of 0.7 ± 0.5 ng/mL, while adults had an initial HbA1C of 8.3 ± 2.0% and significantly higher average C-peptide level of 1.3 ± 0.6 ng/mL. 92% of patients were Caucasian and all patients tested positive for antibodies. 46% of adults presented with a BMI <25 and a favorable lipid profile of high HDLs (59.3 ± 15.7 mg/dL) and low triglycerides (72.7 ± 34.8 mg/dL). 58% of adults were misdiagnosed with T2D. These data suggest that adults with T1D are often incorrectly diagnosed with T2D despite having a first degree relative with T1D, indicating that parents with diabetes who also have a child diagnosed with T1D should be evaluated for T1D. The following characteristics of Caucasian ethnicity, presence of autoantibodies, lean BMI, history of autoimmunity, and a favorable lipid profile should generate suspicion of a T1D diagnosis rather than a T2D diagnosis in adults.

IDOL controls peripheral lipid composition. Matthew Hallowell (Tulane University School of Medicine), Cynthia Hong, Peter Tontonoz, University of California, Los Angeles
Cellular cholesterol levels are regulated by two independent transcriptional pathways governed by the Liver X Receptors (LXRs) and Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Pathway (SREBPs). The sterol sensitive LXRs directly regulate the Inducible Degrader of the LDL Receptor (IDOL), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits lipid uptake through degradation of its targets: the LDL receptor, the VLDL receptor and ApoER2. A previous short-term study (11 weeks) of IDOL knockout mice on high-fat Western diet discovered perturbations in the metabolic profile of the peripheral tissues. To further understand the physiological effect, a long-term study (11 months) challenging WT and IDOL knockout mice with western diet was undertaken. We believe that a prolonged exposure will further uncover the metabolic contribution of the LXR-IDOL axis. Serum and tissue samples were harvested and characterized. Western blot analysis revealed a marked increase in the VLDL receptor expression in the white adipose (WAT) of the Idol-null animals. An associated increase in triglyceride and cholesterol levels within the WAT was detected indicating an enhanced lipid storage capacity in the IDOL knockout animals. We conclude chronic western diet exacerbated the metabolic dysregulation in the IDOL-null mice. These observations demonstrate that IDOL directly affects lipid uptake in the adipose tissue. Understanding the biological impact of the LXR-IDOL pathway may lead to the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic diseases.

Assessing energy expenditure of sedentary behavior in youth using whole-room indirect calorimetry Melissa Lau (Albert Einstein College of Medicine), Kong Chen, Jay Shah, Sari Acra, Maciej S. Buchowski, Vanderbilt University
In epidemiological and clinical studies, energy expenditure (EE) is usually assessed using self-reported activity and corresponding metabolic equivalents termed MET. MET values are defined as the ratio of the metabolic rate for a particular activity to a resting metabolic rate (RMR) value of 1.0 kcal·kg-1 ·h-1. The Compendium of Physical Activities (Compendium) assigns MET intensity values to common activities in adults; we examined the validity and applicability of these MET estimates for sedentary behaviors, which utilize 1-1.5 METs, to children. We enlisted eighteen healthy youth to spend approximately 24 hours under in-person surveillance in a whole-room indirect calorimeter that generated high-precision EE measurements. Participants engaged in two task sessions: self-paced ambulatory exercises comprised the morning activities, and sedentary activities comprised the afternoon session. This study demonstrates cautionary use of adult compendium values to estimate the energy cost of individual sedentary behaviors in children. It also remains unclear if 1.5 METs is an appropriate cutoff value to define sedentary behaviors as a whole in younger populations. Further characterizations of activity patterns in youth are necessary to improve public health initiatives that look to reduce health-related outcomes like obesity, diabetes and other disease states.

The Effects of Insulin Detemir on Behavior in Obese and Insulin Resistant Individuals Imran Huda (Meharry Medical College), Kristen Eckstrand, Hakmook Kang, Heidi Silver, Kevin Niswender, Malcolm Avison, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN
Insulin exerts opposite modulatory influences on dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) activity via PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway; reduced insulin signaling decreases DAT and increases NET surface expression. This suggests that impaired insulin signaling in CNS (e.g. in diabetes, obesity) may blunt DA clearance in striatum, while enhancing DA/NE clearance in prefrontal cortex (PFC), having direct and measureable effects on stop signal task (SST) performance. We predict that short-term insulin detemir treatment rescues SST performance in obese, diabetic volunteers by increasing striatal DA clearance and/or decreasing PFC DA/NE clearance. To test this hypothesis, volunteers performed the SST in fMRI scanners without and then with amphetamine (AMPH), before and after a four-week long insulin detemir or control treatment. Effect of AMPH, which increases PFC and striatal extracellular [DA] and [NE], will inform whether impaired SST in diabetes reflects low PFC [DA] and/or [NE] or high striatal [DA]. Insulin detemir arm showed significant AMPH-induced improvement in stop signal response time (SSRT) at both measurement weeks (p<0.05 at week 2, p<0.005 at week 6) whereas control arm had significant improvement only at week 2 (p<0.05). The two arms did not differ statistically in SSRT except at week 6 after AMPH administration. No other significant differences were identified for any other measures of SST performance, such as critical stop signal delay (cSSD) or median go response time (mGRT). All participants had improved SSRT in week 2 suggesting that they had lower than optimal [DA] in areas associated with response inhibition, such as PFC. Subcortical regions, such as striatum, may also play a role in the observed responses due to the magnitude of AMPH-induced improvements in both measurement weeks. These areas are good targets for future region of interest (ROI) fMRI studies to identify neural correlates of the observed differences in SST performance.

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor β/δ Regulates Angiogenic Activity in Mouse Müller Cells Jack Li (Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine), Vanderbilt University
Neovascularization is the dysregulated growth of blood vessels, and in the eye it is a critical pathologic feature of diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and age-related macular degeneration. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPAR-β/δ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates angiogenic cell behaviors. In this study, we employed retinal angiogenesis models to explore the hypothesis that PPAR-β/δ regulates angiogenesis through regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-like-4 (angptl4) gene expression. We propose that hypoxia induction of VEGF and angptl4 expression in mouse Müller cells (MMC) is PPAR-β/δ-dependent. Retinal MMC cultures were established from wild type and PPAR-β/δ null mice. Culture lysates were collected and assayed for angptl4 and VEGF using qRT-PCR. MMC were treated with the PPAR-β/δ antagonist GSK0660 in 2% FBS growth medium at 0.01uM, 0.1uM, or 1.0uM. Both VEGF and Angptl4 expression increased with duration of hypoxia and was highest after 12 hours of hypoxia. GSK0660 treatment reduced expression of VEGF and angptl4 at 1uM concentration. Paradoxically, PPAR-β/δ knockout MMC revealed increased expression of angptl4 and VEGF under hypoxia compared to wild type. These results may explain the counter-intuitive finding that genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of PPARβ/δ yield opposite effects on retinal angiogenesis in the mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Our findings suggest that PPAR-β/δ may regulate VEGF and angptl4 not through direct induction, but rather potentially through trans-repression.

Loss of nuclear receptor nhr-25 leads to abnormal fat accumulation following endoplasmic reticulum stress Jane Shin (Texas A&M Health Science Center), Jennifer Mamrosh, David Moore, Baylor College of Medicine
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is highly implicated in metabolic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A conserved set of signal transduction pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), provides chaperones, expands the ER, and decreases protein load in order to resolve ER stress occurring from the accumulation of misfolded proteins. In a previous study, a loss of liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) resulted in liver lipid accumulation in mice following ER stress from tunicamycin (TM) treatment. We predict that loss of the nuclear hormone receptor- 25 (nhr-25), a homolog of LRH-1, will also result in abnormal fat accumulation in C. elegans when treated with TM. In order to quantify lipid accumulation, we utilized a triglyceride assay kit and a protein assay kit for normalization of lipids to total protein to compare wildtype worms (N2) and nhr-25 mutants when treated with vehicle or TM. A higher lipid concentration in the nhr-25 worms was observed when treated with TM. Moreover, in order to determine factors dependent on nhr-25 that were also required for ER stress resolution, a siRNA screen was performed. N2 worms treated with TM were fed E. coli containing siRNA plasmids in order to systematically inactivate individual genes post-transcriptionally. The screen covered 95% of 232 genes that we selected from a previous microarray experiment performed in our lab, which identified genes that nhr25 mutants could not induce in response to ER stress. From the screen, 35 unique siRNAs resulted in significantly decreased survival or development following TM treatment. In the future, we would like to determine if any of the new components identified as required for ER stress resolution also confer a fat phenotype following ER stress. Ultimately, we would like to understand novel mechanisms of ER stress resolution in order to develop potential drug targets for metabolic diseases.

Developing a time efficient and cost effective model of diabetes mellitus using ins:NTR-mCherry zebrafish and metronidazole. Andrew Brown (Michigan State University College of Human Medicine), Weibin Zhou, Justin Blaty, University of Michigan
Diabetes mellitus is often studied using time consuming animal models and expensive chemicals. However, recent advances in the genetic modification of zebrafish may allow development of a cheaper and more efficient model of the disease. To test the hypothesis that a diabetic state can be induced in zebrafish with low costs and rapid development, we applied metronidazole (MTZ) to ablate transgenic fish ins:NTR-mCherry, in which a bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) is expressed specifically in pancreatic beta cells under control of the insulin promoter. MTZ is converted to a cytotoxic compound by NTR only in the beta cells and thus results in beta cell ablation, mimicking type one diabetes. Various parameters including drug dosage, feeding schedule, volume of fish tank, and type of food were adjusted while measuring effectiveness of cell ablation via mCherry florescence of beta cells and toxicity via death rate. We have found that 2.5mM and 5mM MTZ solutions are most effective in ablating beta cells of the pancreas while minimizing toxicity. Studies regarding other parameters are ongoing, but will be refined in order to maximize beta cell ablation, growth rate, survival rate, and efficiency in creating a diabetic model. Once the beta cell ablation protocol has been optimized, future tests will include fasting blood glucose levels, limb regeneration, and oil red assay for detecting concentration of circulating lipids. Using MTZ to create low insulin conditions in the genetically modified fish will potentially be an effective way of making a more economical animal model of diabetes. Such a model has substantial implications for future studies, and may help to facilitate a more rapid understanding of the disease and future pharmaceutical interventions.

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activator Receptor-β Regulates Angiogenic Cell Behaviors and its Effects on Choroidal Neovascularization Nicole Prabhu (University of Oklahoma College of Medicine) Sara Savage and John Penn, Vanderbilt University
Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is leading cause of blindness in people over 60. The most severe form, known as “wet” AMD, is believed to result from atrophy of the choriocapillaris, causing the retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) to become hypoxic and secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF stimulates choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and can cause scarring in the macula and severe central vision loss. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β (PPAR-β) is a transcription factor that stimulates the release of VEGF. We hypothesize that PPAR-β plays a dual role in CNV. First, we suggest that PPAR-β may promote production of VEGF by retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). Secondly, we suggest that PPAR-β may stimulate angiogenic behaviors of choroidal endothelial cells (CEC). To test our hypothesis, we tested the effect of PPAR-β agonism and antagonism on in vitro human RPE and CEC (HCEC) and in the mouse laser-induced CNV (LCNV) model. The PPAR-β antagonist, GSK0660, lowered VEGF secretion by RPE cells (p<0.002) and reduced cell proliferation in HCEC (p<0.0001). However, the antagonist showed no effect in the in vivo studies. Interestingly, the PPAR-β agonist, GW0742, did not show any significant changes in our RPE and HCEC in vitro studies, but showed both an increase in lesion size and lesion leakiness in our LCNV studies. While these data are preliminary and further experiments must be conducted to complement our results, it appears likely that PPAR-β is involved in choroidal neovascularization. Therefore, targeted treatments may constitute a novel therapy for the wet form of age-related macular degeneration.

The origin of reprogrammed, insulin-producing intestinal cells Namphuong T. Tran (Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA), Yi-Ju Chen and Ben Z. Stanger, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA
Diabetes mellitus results in the gradual destruction of pancreatic β-cells and/or, eventually, their insulinsecreting abilities. Since islet transplants currently involve low supply/viability and serious immunocomprise, focus is directed towards finding a new, autologous source of β-cells for these patients. Previously, we demonstrated that intestinal crypt cells in an immunocompetent mouse can be reprogrammed into insulin+ cells that functionally and phenotypically resemble endogenous pancreatic β-cells. Gut development studies have also shown that Ngn3+ progenitors give rise to enteroendocrine cells. Thus, we hypothesize that Ngn3+ progenitor cells could be the source of our reprogrammed, insulin-producing cells. We combined our in vivo reprogramming system with an Ngn3+ genetic lineage tracing system, generating “NCVB” transgenic mice carrying four alleles: Ngn3CreER, R26Cherry, VillinrtTA and R26Tetβ. The cells were first labeled by giving the NCVB mice tamoxifen, followed by doxycycline to induce the β-cell reprogramming. The reprogrammed tissues were then genetically traced to their hypothesized origins, the enteroendocrine progenitors, by observing for co-localization of lineage (Cherry) and reprogramming (GFP) signals. We observed that ~35% of the reprogrammed (GFP+) intestinal cells co-stained with insulin, with <10% of GFP+ cells positive for the Ngn3+ lineage tracing marker (Cherry) and ~3% of GFP+ cells positive for both the Ngn3 marker and insulin. We also noticed that among all Ngn3+ labeled cells, ~30% contain the reprogramming marker (GFP), but only a subset has both GFP and insulin. Altogether, our results show that the reprogrammed insulin+ intestinal cells can originate from both Ngn3 and non-Ngn3 lineages. This gives insight that although enteroendocrine progenitors are a possible source of insulin-producing cells, there are other lineages within the crypts that can be reprogrammed similarly, with implications for a larger and more versatile reservoir of new β-cells for the diabetes patient.

SLC1A5 expression in Colon Cancer as Function of Grade: Justifying Imaging with [18F]-4F-GLN. Zeyad Loubnan (Thomas Jefferson University: College of Medicine), Md. Imam Uddin, Kay Washington, H. Charles Manning, Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Sciences
It has been shown that intestinal cells in the colon use primarily Glutamine (Gln) as a source of carbon and energy. Specific to Gln is a transporter, SLC1A5, which is expressed in cells to acquire increasing amounts of Glutamine, may be overexpressed to cancer cells because of an addictive quality that cancer cells exhibit towards Gln. It is our hypothesis that the pathology grade of the cancer cells are directly related to the amount of SLC1A5 expressed on the cells. Surgical core samples have been analyzed from 140 patients (97 with colo-rectal cancer and 43 with resulting Liver Metastases) stained for SLC1A5. Using a subjective scoring method based on the staining intensity, the measure of tumor pathology grade is correlated with the degree of staining for colon/liver samples. Just over 50% of Grade 2 cancers exhibited elevated SLC1A5 levels in the Medium to High ranges. An IHC index calculated with this new method showed a similar proportion of SLC1A5 levels in primary tumor and liver metastases as seen in Figure 5. These results justify the interpretation of evaluating SLC1A5 levels with [18F]-4F-Gutamine using in vivo xenografted athymic nude mice models were generated by implanting human colon cancer cells.

Recruitment in Multi-Center Type II Diabetes RCT: Challenges & Solutions Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Einstein Diabetes Center

Jeremy Miles,

In June 2013, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine began recruitment for the GRADE randomized clinical trial, a study comparing the effectiveness of various diabetes medications. Novel methods of recruitment have been implemented at Einstein. However, many challenges have emerged during the initial phases of recruitment. The goal of this research is to analyze the initial recruitment data, and by doing so, we will be able to identify the successes and drawbacks that we’ve encountered thus far. Three main approaches have been taken to enroll patients into GRADE. First, there is a sifting of potentially eligible patients using an electronic query of the Montefiore Medical System EMR. These patients then receive letters and phone calls about GRADE. The second tactic is an academic detailing of Montefiore clinic sites. This academic detailing includes formal meetings with site directors and PCPs and distributing fliers and brochures around the Montefiore clinics. Lastly, if a patient wants to discuss the study with his/her PCP or is scheduled for any of the GRADE visits, a note in the EMR is sent to the PCP. So far, our EMR query has identified 740 eligible patients from four Montefiore clinics. We have spoken to 153 of these patients and, to date, 36 are scheduled for a screening visit. There were many patients who were ineligible because they had diabetes for more than five years. The EMR query picked up these patients even though they were ineligible because the EMR at Montefiore is only 2-3 years old and does not have exact onset dates of diabetes for all patients. 7 % of the patients we spoke to wanted to discuss the study with their PCP before entering the study. Of the patients who were eligible, 34% declined to participate in the study. While we have been moderately successful up until now it is clear that we can improve our recruitment approach. We need to refine our EMR query software so that ineligible patients do not appear on our patient list. Strategic phone calling is important for future recruitment. Moreover, there seems to be a disconnect between the PCPs at Montefiore and the research focus at Einstein. We need to continue efforts to keep the GRADE study on the minds of the PCPs, whether it is through academic detailing, notes through the EMR or publicizing GRADE throughout the Einstein-Montefiore community. Pinpointing these barriers will allow us to adjust our recruitment strategies and enhance patient involvement in the GRADE study for the future.

The role of extracellular matrix deposition and capillary density in insulin resistant Cyp2c44(-/-) mouse skeletal muscle. Jaime Dickerson (Florida Atlantic University Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine) Dr. Ambra Pozzi and Dr. James M. Luther, Vanderbilt University
Cyp2c44, a mouse cytochrome P450 (Cyp) epoxygenase, converts arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Cyp2c44(-/-) mice lack the major vascular Cyp enzyme responsible for production of vasodilatory and pro-angiogenic EETs. When assessed by hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamps, Cyp2c44(-/-) mice have decreased insulin-dependent glucose uptake response in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, ex vivo skeletal muscle insulin-dependent glucose uptake appears to be similar in Cyp2c44(-/-) compared to wild-type. One possibility is that impaired tissue perfusion in vivo contributes to insulin resistance in Cyp2c44(-/-) skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that Cyp2c44(-/-) mice have an increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) abundance and/or a decrease in capillary density impairing tissue perfusion which causes insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. An accumulation of ECM could prevent insulin from readily diffusing from the blood to the muscle tissue, and fewer capillaries could limit the blood flow and insulin delivery to muscle tissue. Using immunofluorescent staining we quantified ECM abundance and capillary density in frozen sections of Cyp2c44(-/-) and wild type skeletal muscle tissue. We used collagen IV as a marker of ECM and CD31 as a marker of endothelial cells in capillaries and analyzed the immunofluorescent signal per area to determine the percent area covered by either collagen IV or CD31. The collagen IV abundance per area was similar between Cyp2c44(-/-) and wild type skeletal muscle tissue (14.8 ± 1.09% vs. 14.5 ± 0.11% in Cyp2c44(-/-) vs. wild type; p = 0.81), indicating that excess ECM accumulation does not explain the skeletal muscle insulin resistance in Cyp2c44(-/-) mice. Quantification of CD31 staining will be similarly applied to analyze capillary density in Cyp2c44(-/-) mice. Investigation of the mechanism of insulin resistance in Cyp2c44(-/-) mouse muscle tissue will further elucidate how the Cyp2c44-derived EETs contribute to insulin sensitivity. This work may lead to further investigation of the connection between EETs and vascular changes associated with insulin resistant states and possible pharmacological manipulation of EETs metabolism to improve insulin sensitivity.

3,5- Diiodo-L-Thyronine (T2) treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity but not hepatic steatosis in rats fed an unsaturated fat diet. Jaclyn M. Snikeris (Penn State College of Medicine), Daniel F. Vatner, Rachel J. Perry, Yasmeen Rahimi, Violeta Popov, Gerald I. Shulman, Varman T. Samuel, Yale University
Selective thyroid hormone mimetics that specifically target the nuclear thyroid hormone β-receptor have been shown to potently decrease plasma lipids without the deleterious cardiac and bone effects associated with thyroid hormone itself. However, while these agents effectively decrease hepatic lipid content in fat fed rats, they also induce insulin resistance. In contrast, the thyroid hormone metabolite, 3,5- Diiodo-L-Thyronine (T2) has been reported to decrease hepatic lipid content and improve glucose tolerance. This compound does not activate the classical nuclear thyroid hormone receptors and thus may avoid the toxicity seen with TRβ specific agonists. We hypothesized that T2 treatment would improve hepatic insulin sensitivity by decreasing hepatic triglyceride content and improving hepatic insulin signaling. To test this hypothesis, rats were placed on a high fat diet and treated with T2 or vehicle at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg i.p. for 10 days. Tissue specific insulin sensitivity was evaluated by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, and biochemical and molecular analyses were performed in both fasting and hyperinsulinemic conditions. There were no significant differences in body weight, adipose mass, liver triglyceride content, plasma glucose, and non-esterified fatty acids between T2 and vehicle treated rats. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was slightly improved in the T2 group. Specifically, insulin suppressed endogenous glucose output by 74% ± 10 in T2 treated rats, as compared with 46% ± 5 in vehicle treated rats (p=0.04). There was no difference in basal endogenous glucose production or insulin stimulated peripheral glucose disposal. Insulin signaling as assessed by Akt phosphorylation was improved; insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation was increased by 260% in T2 treated animals (p=0.003). T2 did not to act through classical nuclear thyroid hormone receptors, for gene expression of DIO1 and hairless were not increased in tissues of treated animals. There were no significant differences in expression of genes of hepatic lipogenesis (FAS, DGAT 2), hepatic gluconeogenesis (G6Pase), fatty acid oxidation (PPARα, PGC1-α, FGF21) or adipokines (adiponectin and leptin). Activation of ERK1/2 has been proposed as a non-genomic pathway for thyroid hormone action. Thus, we quantified hepatic ERK1/2 phosphorylation and found a small (15%), but significant increase (p=0.04) with T2 treatment. In summary, while 10 days of T2 treatment did not ameliorate NAFLD in fatfed rodents it did lead to subtle improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity, which may be due to the activation of non-classical signaling pathways. Further exploration of these pathways could hold promise for developing new agents for treating insulin resistance.

Glutamate Uptake in Rodent Primary Cortical Astrocytes Adam M. Horblitt (Creighton University School of Medicine), Peili Wang and Owen Chan, Yale University School of Medicine Department of Internal Medicine section of Endocrinology.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitor neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Previously, we showed that GABA acts within the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) to suppress the counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia. More importantly, recurrent exposure to hypoglycemia (RH) increases VMH GABA levels which in turn, suppress the counterregulatory responses to subsequent bouts of hypoglycemia. Our current research suggests that following RH, VMH GABAergic neurons may adapt to using alternate fuel substrates such as lactate to meet their metabolic needs. Hence, during hypoglycemia when glucose levels are low, lactate may prevent VMH GABAergic neurons from sensing a fall in glucose and thus, GABAergic inhibition of the counterregulatory responses is maintained. The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms that increase lactate production in the VMH during RH. Lactate is primarily derived from astrocytic metabolism. As opposed to GABA, glutamate in the VMH stimulates the counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia and following its release, this excitatory neurotransmitter is removed from the extracellular space by glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), which is located on astrocytes. Because the uptake of glutamate is coupled to an energy dependent Na+-K+-ATPase, an increase in glutamate uptake leads to greater glycogenolysis and an associated increase in lactate production by the astrocytes. In prior studies, we showed that extracellular lactate levels can be reduced in RH animals by reducing VMH GLT-1 expression. Thus, in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that recurrent glucose deprivation can increase glutamate uptake in astrocytes using primary rat astrocyte cultures. Astrocytes were repeatedly incubated in low glucose medium for 90 minutes for three consecutive days and subsequently, the uptake of 14C-labelled glutamate was assessed. Astrocytes exposed to recurrent episodes of glucose deprivation had a greater tendency to take up glutamate compared to astrocytes maintained in normal glucose medium. Together, our data suggests that the observed increase in astrocytic glutamate uptake may enhance lactate production by astrocytes and contribute to counterregulatory failure.

Patient skin fibroblasts may serve as a robust cell-based model in screening for potential drug therapies for Wolfram Syndrome Aaron Lam (University of California, San Francisco), Cris Brown, Kohsuke Kanekura, Mai Kanekura, Matt Tremblay, and Fumihiko Urano, Washington University in St. Louis
Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, and neurological dysfunction leading to death in mid-adulthood. WFS is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 4, which results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis. There are no known direct treatments for WFS, and current management efforts primarily focus on addressing the complications of WFS. For our studies, we devised a reporter system for the expression of CHOP, an integral gene involved in the activation of ER stress-mediated cell death. With this system, we identified two pharmacologically active compounds, Sunitinib and PD-407824, particularly effective in reducing CHOP expression in human embryonic kidney cell lines under ER stress. In light of these results, we are now considering skin fibroblasts from Wolfram patients as viable cell-based vehicles to elucidate the efficacy of these candidate compounds in mitigating ER stressmediated apoptosis. Preliminary investigations have already revealed a number of patients expressing higher levels of CHOP as compared to control lines. We plan to treat these lines with Sunitinib and PD407824 and follow CHOP expressivity. Future studies will extend drug treatment to neural progenitor and β cell lines.

Resveratrol Enhances Insulin Sensitivity and Promotes “Browning” of Subcutaneous Fat in Insulin Resistant Humans Sejal Patel, David Hirsch, Roger Maginley, Kehao Zhang, Xinyan Dong, Michelle Carey, Pooja Raghavan, Charles Kim, Preeti Kishore, and Meredith Hawkins Albert Einstein College of Medicine
Insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and thus an important therapeutic target. Detrimental metabolic effects of white adipose tissue in obesity include increased macrophage infiltration, oxidative stress, and cytokine production. Resveratrol (RSV), a plant-derived polyphenol that is abundant in the skin of grapes and red wine, is believed to have anti-inflammatory and anti-aging effects. In animal models, RSV improves insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function via activation of NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (Sirt1), a regulatory enzyme, and AMP-kinase. We hypothesize that resveratrol will have beneficial metabolic effects on subcutaneous adipose tissue in insulin resistant humans, reducing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. RSV may also promote “browning” of white adipose tissue, a potentially advantageous shift in metabolic characteristics and mitochondrial function. Therefore, to determine resveratrol’s effect on insulin sensitivity in humans, we performed 6-hour euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies to quantify insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose production in overweight human subjects (n=17, age 55±3 yr; BMI =28±1 kg/m2; HOMA-IR= 5.3±0.9) before and after 28 days of treatment with RSV 2000 mg daily in randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled fashion. Subcutaneous fat biopsies were performed at baseline and post- RSV. RSV treatment increased glucose uptake by 40% in these insulin resistant subjects. “Browning” gene expression in whole fat increased or trended upwards with RSV, consistent with a transitional “beige” adipose phenotype. UCP1 expression increased after treatment (48% increase; p<.05), while ZIC1 and PGC1α expression trended upward (128% and 32% increase, respectively). “Beige fat” gene expression in whole fat also increased or trended upwards after RSV including CD137 (61% increase; p<.05), SHOX2, TMEM 26, and LHX8 expression (115%, 58%, 99% increase, respectively). Gene expression of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin also increased substantially (76%, p<.05). Together, these findings suggest that resveratrol may be an important therapeutic agent to enhance insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant humans, at least in part through antiinflammatory effects and promotion of “browning” or “beiging” of white adipose tissue.

Muscle specific deletion of integrin-linked kinase improves insulin resistance in high fat-fed mice. Bradley R. Reuter (Wake Forest School of Medicine), Li Kang, Deanna P. Bracy, Freyja D. James, David H Wasserman, Vanderbilt University.
During the progression of skeletal muscle insulin resistance, changes occur in the composition of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). High fat diet feeding in mice causes inflamation, which leads to increased levels of collagen and hyaluronan in the ECM. Increased collagen deposition activates integrin receptors in the ECM. Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors that interact with the ECM and mediate a variety of bidirectional signaling. Previous studies have shown that activation of the collagen-integrin α2β1 interaction contributes to the development of diet-induced muscle insulin resistance. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a downstream component of the integrin signaling may be key in linking ECM remodeling to insulin resistance. To investigate this, a muscle specific ILK knock out mouse line was generated and studied. We hypothesize that muscle-specific deletion of ILK would improve muscle insulin action in high fat-fed mice. The ILK knockout mice and their wild type (WT) littermate controls were fed either a low fat chow diet or a high fat diet for 15 weeks. The high fat diet derived 60% of its calories from fat. At 19 weeks, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiment was performed to assess insulin sensitivity of the mice. Western blot analysis was done to determine insulin signaling in gastrocnemius and vastus lateralis muscles. Plasma samples taken during the clamp experiment were also analyzed to determine circulating insulin levels before and during the clamp. ILK deletion did not affect the body weight or composition of the mice regardless of diet. Muscle insulin sensitivity was not affected by ILK deletion in the chow-fed mice as glucose infusion rate (GIR), endogenous glucose production (endoRa), and glucose disappearance rate (Rd) were the same between WT and the KO mice. In contrast, in the HF-fed mice ILK deletion markedly improved muscle insulin resistance as shown by increased GIR and Rd. Using P-AKT as a downstream insulin signaling marker, we showed insulin signaling to be greatly increased in the ILK KO mice during HF feeding. The insulin ELISA data shows this increase in insulin action and insulin signaling is not due to disproportional insulin levels in these KO mice compared to their WT counterparts. While the male WT and KO mice had comparable insulin levels at both baseline and during the insulin clamp, the female KO mice instead showed lower insulin levels at both basal and insulin-stimulated states. In conclusion, our results suggest that muscle ILK is a pivotal mediator in linking ECM remodeling and high fat dietinduced muscle insulin resistance. This work adds to the growing pool of support for the ECM modeling of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. As the exact role of the ECM is more reveled it has possibility to open many new areas of discover and potential drug design for patients with diabetes.

Effects of Nicotine use on expression of VEGF, ETS-1, and Nephrin in a diabetes model. Bobby Sistani (University of Alabama in Birmingham School of Medicine) Ping Hua, Phillip Chumley, Edgar Jaimes, UAB Tobacco smoking has been proved to be an independent risk factor accelerating the progression of diabetic nephropathy, the most common cause of Chronic Kidney Disease in the United States. Among the numerous harmful substances found in tobacco, nicotine is one of the highly active compounds that maybe acquired through active and passive smoking. The db/db mouse strain has been used as a model of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of nicotine on the levels and presence of nephrin, VEGF, and ETS-1 in the kidney. Eight weeks old db/db mice (C57BLKS/Jlepr) and control non-diabetic mice (C57BLKSJ) were divided in 2 groups each: control mice on tap water, control mice on nicotine (100 ug/ml) in the drinking water, diabetic mice on tap water, diabetic mice on nicotine. The mice were maintained in their respective treatment groups for 10 weeks. Kidneys were then harvested and saved for histology and molecular biology. Western blot densitometry studies indicate a significant decrease in nephrin levels with nicotine use. Further data and results will be reported later. These observations will provide insight for the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy with nicotine use and future treatment options.

Mechanisms Underlying Diabetes-Accelerated Osteochondrogenic Differentiation and Ectopic Calcification of Blood Vessels Monica R. Kumar (University of South Alabama), Ngoc Nyguen, Stephanie Miller, Minh-Thy Nguyen, Darren Lee, and Mei Speer, Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington
Vascular calcification, the “hardening” of blood vessels, is prevalent in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although often asymptomatic at early stages, diabetic patients with vascular calcification showed a heightened risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, stroke, and lower-limb amputation compared to those without. Vascular calcification is an actively regulated, cell-mediated process, similar to bone development and remodeling. Using a genetic fate mapping strategy, we recently identified vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as the major cell source that contributes to the enhanced osteochondrogenic differentiation and calcification of diabetic blood vessels. In addition, receptor for advanced glycation-end products (RAGE), Runx2, a critical transcription factor for bone and cartilage formation, and active form of extracellular signal-related kinase (p-Erk) were associated with SMCs undergoing osteochondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, SMCs isolated from healthy arteries cultured in high glucose procalcific medium at levels of hyperglycemia showed increased Runx2 expression and matrix calcification compared to normal glucose procalcific cultures. There was also an increase in RAGE and p-Erk in SMCs cultured in high glucose procalcific medium. Since the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE (ctRAGE) has an Erk docking site and phosphorylation of Runx2 through p-Erk is critical for osteoblastic differentiation, it is possible that ctRAGE stabilizes p-Erk via its binding, leading to prolonged activation of Runx2 through formation of RAGE-p-Erk-Runx2 complexes, thereby enhancing osteochondrogenic differentiation and calcification of SMCs. To test this possibility, we induced osteochondrogenic differentiation of vascular SMC with high glucose, procalcific medium. Cell lysates were collected at days 2, 6, and 14 of the treatment. Monoclonal antibody specific for p-Erk was used to precipitate the RAGE-p-Erk-Runx2 complexes followed by a dissociation of the complexes and Western blotting for Runx2, RAGE, and total Erk. We found that there was indeed a formation of the RAGE-p-Erk-Runx2 complex in high glucose cultures as evidence by a ~60 kDa Runx2 band and a ~45 kDa RAGE band found in the p-Erk-precipitated cell lysate. Our results are the first to demonstrate the presence of RAGE-p-Erk-Runx2 complexes, a likely cause for the enhanced osteochondrogenic differentiation and calcification of vascular SMCs under hyperglycemia.

HIV-1 accessory viral protein R (Vpr) and hepatic de novo lipogenesis: Implications for the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. Uchechi Egbuhuzo, University of South Carolina School of Medicine. Neeti Agarwal, PhD; Dinakar Iyer, PhD; and Dr. Ashok Balasubramanyam. Baylor College of Medicine.
Fatty liver disease is defined as abnormal lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, associated with liver function abnormalities with a high rate of progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Fatty liver, often associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, occurs frequently in HIV patients. While some of these metabolic abnormalities may result from adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV, the intriguing possibility that the virus per se may be responsible for some of the defects has not been fully explored. The goal of this project is to determine if the HIV virus can cause fatty liver disease.
The specific hypothesis is that the HIV-1 accessory protein viral protein R (Vpr) can induce fatty liver disease. Vpr acts in vitro as a corepressor of PPARγ, a critical regulator of lipid metabolism and adipose insulin sensitivity (2), and recent data from our lab suggests that it also corepresses PPARα. Vpr’s effects on PPARγ lead to hyperlipolysis and increased flux of fatty acids into the liver; its effects on PPARα block fatty acid oxidation in the liver. Both of these effects would promote fatty liver. The focus of my project is to determine whether there is a third Vpr-mediated mechanism that contributes to fatty liver, namely, whether and how it can promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis. I explored this mechanism using tissues from two mouse models: a transgenic model, expressing Vpr under control of the PEPCK promoter in liver and adipose tissues, and a pharmacologic model, wherein synthetic Vpr is administered subcutaneously through an Alzet pump. Fatty liver developed in both mouse models. Notably, Vpr is present in the plasma of both mouse models, suggesting that it can act in a hormonelike manner.
Our data show that (in both mouse models) Vpr enhances the mRNA and protein expression of both SREBP 1c and ChREBP, master regulators of hepatic lipogenesis. Vpr concomitantly increases the mRNA and protein levels of key lipogenic gene targets of SREBP1c - FASN and SCD-1 – and decreases Ser79 phosphorylation of ACC. These effects demonstrate that Vpr in the circulation is sufficient to upregulate hepatic lipogenesis and contribute to the development of fatty liver.
These novel findings raise the following critical question that is currently being addressed in the lab how does Vpr cause all these effects? We hypothesize that Vpr interacts with and coactivates LXRα, the master regulator of both SREBP1c and ChREBP.

Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Kidney Transplantation Amanda Box, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Leigh Anne Dageforde, MD, MPH, Irene Fuerer, Dasha Bond, Kerri Cavanaugh, MD, MPH Vanderbilt University Medical Center
BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic and demographic disparities in kidney transplantation persist despite interventions designed to improve accessibility. A proportion of referred patients never present for transplant evaluation, and this group is a vulnerable population requiring additional assistance. The primary aim of this study was to compare educational, psychological and social factors between patients referred for kidney transplantation who do not initiate and those who successfully complete the evaluation. METHODS: Recruited patients were referred for kidney transplant evaluation at Vanderbilt Transplant Center (VTC) November 2012-June 2013. Participants who did not complete the evaluation visit were matched on race and month of visit with patients who did complete transplant evaluation visit. Data was collected via a standardized phone-based survey determining demographic factors, socioeconomic status (SES), health literacy and numeracy, pre-evaluation visit concerns about transplantation, quality of life, Internet use and systems of social support. Analysis included Chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, and t-tests. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were matched for a total of thirty-two matches. No demographic data, including age, SES, martial status, and distance to VTC, affected evaluation no show or completion. Quality of life and health literacy and numeracy also were comparable. Prior evaluation at a different transplant center was significantly correlated with no show (p=0.023). Not being on dialysis (p=0.026) and using the Internet for healthcare information (p=0.043) were significantly associated with evaluation completion. No significant differences existed between pre-evaluation patient concerns of no shows versus those of completed participants. Affording medications after transplant was most identified among all participants when asked their foremost concern about the evaluation visit (27.1%). However, affording medications after transplant was the most cited pre-evaluation concern among no shows (71.9%), while the length of time to wait for a transplant was the most cited concern among completed participants (62.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients’ decisions to present to the initial kidney transplant evaluation visit are complex and require further examination than can be ascertained via a simple phone survey. Patient attitudes and motivation may have a significant impact on evaluation completion. A future study using focus groups will further explore the nuances of motivations and attitudes towards transplantation of patients who do and do not complete their evaluation visits.

Efficacy and comparative effectiveness of commercial weight loss programs: Preliminary results from Weight Watchers David Jacobs (University of Maryland School of Medicine), Ruchi Srivastava, Zoobia Chaudhry, Kimberly Gudzune, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
INTRODUCTION: Nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, which places them at risk for diabetes and hypertension. Patients often turn to commercial weight loss programs, like Weight Watchers (WW), yet the efficacy of programs like these is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the weight loss and blood pressure lowering benefits among WW participants, as well as compare the effectiveness of WW to medically supervised counseling on weight loss.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE from 1 January 2002 to 13 June 2013, as well as included articles from a prior comparative effectiveness review. Paired investigators independently screened results to assess eligibility, and then abstracted data. We synthesized results qualitatively by outcome (mean %weight change, mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) change, mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) change).
RESULTS: We included 10 trials. WW participants achieved up to a 7.5% weight loss and improved their blood pressure by lowering their SBP up to 6.5 mmHg and DBP up to 4.4 mmHg. As compared to medically supervised counseling, a majority of trials (n=8) favored WW for achieving up to 3.6% greater weight loss.
SUMMARY: We found that WW participants lose weight and improve their blood pressure, which suggests that WW may be a reasonable option for patients. Given our findings, health insurers who provide benefits coverage for programs such as WW may help more patients access this program.

Hepatocyte specific knockout of SRSF3 in mice shows similar activation of insulin signaling in response to insulin treatment as wild-type Sameer Gupta (Drexel University College of Medicine), Supriya Sen, Nicholas Webster, University of California, San Diego / VA San Diego Healthcare System
Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) is a member of the serine/arginine rich (SR) family of RNA binding proteins that play a crucial role in constitutive and alternative splicing, as well as other RNA metabolism. It has been demonstrated to regulate splicing of the insulin receptor (INSR) gene in vitro in hepatoma and HEK cell lines and in vivo in mouse liver. Hepatocyte specific deletion of SRSF3 (SRSF3HKO) causes increased expression of insulin receptor IR-A, which lacks exon 11. The 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11 broaden the receptor binding specificity such that IR-A binds IGF2 with high affinity. As SRSF3HKO mice show high expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and increased insulin sensitivity when compared to control littermates we checked insulin receptor signaling in the SRSF3HKO mouse model. The mice were treated with insulin, injected intraperitoneally (IP), at 3 months of age. Their livers were harvested and protein was extracted. Western blots were used to detect activation of the insulin-signaling pathway in SRSF3HKO and control livers. Insulin receptor (INSR), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3-β), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), protein kinase B (AKT), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation were checked. We found that SRSF3HKO mice show similar insulin signaling in response to insulin treatment when compared to wild-type. Ongoing studies will explore the effects of IGF2 treatment in SRSF3HKO liver.

Understanding the Function of the Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 Johnny Ling1, Brennan Hicks2, Ambra Pozzi2, Corina Borza2 1University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, 2Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Discoidin Domain Receptors (DDRs) are members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily of receptors and are shown to be upregulated in kidney fibrosis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, and cancer. Currently two different DDRs, namely DDR1 and DDR2, have been described, and five subtypes of DDR1 (a-e) have been identified. Of these, the DDR1b has been shown to contain an NPXY motif, which is important for binding scaffolding proteins that control receptor activation and function. The scaffolding protein talin has been shown to bind the NPXY motifs of the integrin matrix receptors. However, whether talin binds and controls DDR1 function is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether talin binds DDR1b and whether this binding controls DDR1b function. We hypothesize that the presence of the NPXY motif on the DDR1b cytoplasmic tail is a talin-binding site and this binding is important for regulating DDR1 function. To test our hypothesis, the talin cDNA was inserted into the pGEX vector and this vector was then subcloned into BL21 DH3 Gold bacterial cells to produce the desired GST-tagged talin protein. The GST-tagged talin protein was successfully produced upon induction of bacteria with IPTG, and the purified protein is functional and able to bind DDR1.The next step in our research is to determine whether talin binds only the NPXY motif. To do this, we will determine the ability of talin to bind DDR1b vs. DDR1a, which does not contain an NPXY motif. We will also determine whether binding of talin to DDR1 controls receptor function. Understanding how talin modulates DDR function may enhance development of new treatment methods to block unwanted receptor activation in fibrotic disease.

Insulin secretion in postpubertal adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency is reduced despite “normal” glucose tolerance. Saloni Malik (Perelman School of Medicine - University of Pennsylvania), Lalitha Gudipaty, Nora Rosenfeld, Chris Kubrak, Diva De Leon, Denis Hadjiliadis, Ronald Rubenstein, Michael R. Rickels and Andrea Kelly, Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
With improved survival among individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) has emerged as a significant comorbidity that is associated with worse pulmonary function, worse nutritional status and increased mortality. To improve the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying development of CFRD, we are conducting a study to characterize insulin secretion and secretory capacity in subjects with CF across the spectrum of glucose tolerance. To test the hypothesis that individuals with CF and pancreatic insufficiency demonstrate impaired insulin secretion, patients > 16years of age were characterized according to their annual Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (oGTT); pancreatic insufficient with normal glucose tolerance (PI-NGT) were defined as individuals with 2 hr plasma glucose < 140 mg/dl. Subjects underwent Glucose Potentiated Arginine (GPA) testing during which the acute insulin responses to arginine were determined under fasting (AIRarg), 230 mg/dl (AIRpot) and 340 mg/dl (AIRmax) hyperglycemic clamp conditions. To date, 10 PI-NGT subjects completed the study and when compared to healthy controls (n=14). PI-NGT subjects were significantly younger, had lower BMI, and trended towards higher one-hour plasma glucose levels than controls. There was a trend toward lower AIRarg in PI-NGT than control (18.9 ± 3.1 vs. 31.0 ± 4.5 µU/ml, p=0.07); furthermore, the glucose-potentiated acute insulin responses to arginine were significantly lower in PI-NGT subjects for both AIRpot (61 ± 6 vs. 130 ± 14 µU/ml, p < 0.01) and AIRmax (70 ± 15 vs. 169 ± 22 µU/ml, p < 0.01). Similarly, the acute C-peptide response to arginine was lower under fasting, 230 mg/dl and 340 mg/dl hyperglycemic clamp conditions (0.8 ± 0.1 vs. 1.7 ± 0.2, 2.1 ± 0.5 vs. 5.9 ± 0.6, and 2.9 ± 0.4 vs. 5.8 ± 0.6 ng/ml; p ≤ 0.01 for all). Insulin sensitivity (M/I) was not different between the groups (0.38 ± 0.14 vs. 0.41 ± 0.06 (mg x min)/kg, p = 0.643). These results indicate that patients with pancreatic insufficient CF manifest significantly reduced β-cell secretory capacity despite “normal” glucose tolerance. The extent to which this decrease in insulin secretion reflects pancreatic exocrine damage extending to endocrine tissue vs. an inherent β-cell or insulin secretion pathway defect is not known but is the subject of ongoing investigation.

Spautin-1 inhibits TUG cleavage and GLUT4 trafficking	   Yun-Yun K. Chen (University of Vermont, College of Medicine), Estifanos Habtemichael, Jonathan Bogan, Yale University School of Medicine	   	   To increase glucose uptake in fat and muscle, insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from intracellular storage vesicles to the cell surface. Insulin signals through PIST proteins to stimulate endoproteolytic cleavage of Tether containing UBX domain for GLUT4 (TUG). TUG cleavage mobilizes intracellular GLUT4 and produces the novel ubiquitin-like modifier TUGUL. Cleavage is likely mediated by a protein that is a member of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase (USP) family, but the identity of this protein is not known. Here, we tested the hypothesis that USP10 or 13 is required for TUG cleavage in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These USP isoforms act on Beclin-1, a PISTbinding partner implicated in autophagy, and are specifically inhibited by the pharmacologic agent, spautin-1. We observed decreased proteolytic processing of TUG in spautin-1 treated cells, compared to controls, as assessed by immunoblots of both the amino- and carboxyl- terminal TUG cleavage products. Ongoing experiments are examining the effect of spautin-1 on GLUT4 translocation, and are studying the potential roles of USP10 and USP13 using RNAi and overexpression. These experiments may identify the TUG protease and will potentially link autophagic processes to GLUT4 translocation.

Understanding the Role of Nicotine in the Progression of Kidney Disease in Diabetic Mice John Obert, UAB School of Medicine; Gabriel Rezonzew, MD; Edgar Jaimes, MD; UAB School of Medicine
Kidney damage is a major complication of both type I and type II diabetes. Tobacco and/or nicotine use among diabetics is a risk factor for the progression of kidney disease. With more than 285 million diabetics and 1 billion tobacco users worldwide, discovering the mechanisms by which this occurs is critical to improving our understanding of the disease process and to develop strategies to minimize harm to the diabetic population. We hypothesized that tobacco related kidney damage is mediated in large part by specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHr), in particular, the α7 present in the kidney. To test this hypothesis, we administered nicotine to commercially available C57 mice lacking the α7 nACHr and to wild type C57 mice, both diabetic and non-diabetic. Preliminary data suggests that nicotine induced kidney damage is mitigated by the lack of the α7 nACHr, with both proteinuria and albuminuria relatively decreased in the α7 nACHr -/- animals on nicotine versus wild type. After sacrifice, further analysis will be conducted to characterize and determine the extent of kidney damage, and the degree to which lack of the α7 nACHr protects the kidney from nicotine.
