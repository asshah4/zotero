The single-dose absorption kinetics of ciprofloxatin in different regions of the human gastrointestinal tract were investigated using a remotecontrol drug delivery device (HF-capsule). Doses of 180 to 200 mg ciprofloxacin (as a lactic acid solution) were placed in the HF-capsule and administered to four healthy male adults. The position of the HF-capsule in the gastrointestinal tract was checked via radiographic examination. The release of the solution from the HF-capsule was induced by a radio signal. In each volunteer, the solution was released into five different regions of the gastrointestinal tract: the stomach (B), jejunum (C,), ileum (Cz), ascending colon (D1), and descending colon (D,). Two control runs (Al, A,), involving oral administration of the solution, were used as a reference for calculation of area under the curve. The oral administration of a conventional 250-mg tablet (A,) was also studied. The plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin and urine concentrations of ciprofloxatin, desethylene- (Ml), sulfo- (M2), and oxociprofloxacin (M3) were determined fluorimetritally by high-performance liquid chromatography. Intraindividual comparisons indicated a progressive decrease in the amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed (100 percent = mean of AUCA1 and AUCAJ from the jejunum (-61 percent, median), ileum (-75 percent), colon ascendens (-90 percent), and colon descendens (-95 percent). Absolute amounts of renally excreted ciprofloxacin and metabolites decreased due to the reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin, but the metabolite pattern was unchanged. It is concluded that the main absorption site for ciprofloxacin is the upper part of the intestinal tract (duodenum, jejunum).

T he oral bioavailability of ciprofloxacin is 55 to 85 percent in healthy subjects under normal conditions [l--5]. Drug interaction studies with
butylscopolamine and metoclopramide demonstrate a rapid absorption of ciprofloxacin in the upper gastrointestinal tract [6]. No detailed information exists on
possible differences in the absorption kinetics and/or presystemie elimination of ciprofloxacin in different
parts of the human gastrointestinal tract.
Determination of the absorption kinetics of eiprofloxacin and the main site of this absorption was conducted using controlled bolus release of ciprofloxacin
solution at selected regions of the human gastrointestinal tract. This was achieved with the aid of a special
drug delivery device? the HF-capsule [7,8], in which drug release is triggered by an external high-
frequency (27 MHz) radion signal (Figure 1).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Single doses of ciprofloxacin (absorption kinetics as lactic acid-based solution formulations, specially pre-
pared for use in the HF-capsule provided by Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Federal Republic of Germany and
as a conventional 250-mg tablet) were investigated in four healthy male volunteers (aged 25 to 30 years). All
gave their informed written consent. The drug was released from the HF-capsule at dif-
ferent sites of the gastrointestinal tract (Figure 2). The release procedure into predetermined areas of the
gastrointestinal tract (B = stomach; Cl = jejunum; C2 = ileum; Dl = ascending colon; D2 = descending
colon) was executed after location of the capsule was confirmed by radiographic examination. The study design was comprised of three parts, as shown in Fig-
ure 3. The runs in each volunteer followed the sequence
Al, Dl, C2, B, Cl, D2, A3, A2, with a one week washout period between treatments. Detection of cipro-
floxacin in plasma and of ciprofloxacin, desethylene(Ml), sulfo- (M2) and oxo-ciprofloxacin (M3) in urine samples was carried out by a high-performance liquid
chromatography method with fluorometric detection
P, 101.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of ciprofloxacin in the
plasma (area under the curve [AUC], maximal concentration [C,,,], time of C,,, Et,,,]) were calculated by moment analysis. The individual means for the runs
Al/A2 were used as an intraindividual reference value (100 percent) for the amount absorbed (close normalized area under the curve [AUC,,,,,o,,l). The excretion of metabolites and unchanged ciprofloxacin in urine was calculated as molar equivalents and ex-

Because of the small number of subjects studied, statistical comparisons were made usinganonparametricMann-Whitney U test alone. Values for AU&,,,,,,,,,,, C,,,, and t,,, were compared.
RESULTS
Pharmacokinetic parameters of ciprofloxacin are presented as median and range in Tables I to III. No significant differences were found (Mann-Whitney U test) for AUC, C,,,, and t,,, between the controls (Al, A2), HF-capsule release in the stomach, and tab-

let administration. However, differences in AUC and C were seen when comparing controls with the rest%? for HF-capsule release in the jejunum, ileum, and ascending and descending colon, but t,,, values did not differ (Table IV).
No significant differences in the pattern of urinary excretion of metabolites and unchanged ciprofloxacin were seen. Decreases in the urinary recovery of ciprofloxacin and its metabolites correlated with the decrease in absorbed ciprofloxacin.
COMMENTS
No significant differences in AUC: C,,,, and t,,, were observed when we compared the data obtained

from oral administration of ciprofloxacin as a solution, as a tablet, or as a solution released in the stomach. However, there were marked differences for AUC and Cm,, between oral administration and release of the drug. in the jejunum and the distal regions of the gut. These differences were statistically significant.
Since the t,,, of ciprofloxacin absorption is dependent on stomach emptying time [61, it can be assumed that this drug is not absorbed in the stomach. The metabolite profile in urine was unchanged, regardless of where the drug was released along the gastrointestinal tract. It would appear therefore that qualitative differences in pre-hepatic first-pass metabolism caused by differences in intestinal contents or intramural degradation can be excluded.
1% vitro results with human colon tissue show both passive absorption of ciprofloxacin and a countersecretion mechanism [II]. Experimehts in rats demonstrate a lack of absorption of ofloxacin, another 4-quinolone, in isolated colon segments [WI. It should be noted that the HF-capsule method involves drug absorption only at the release site and at sites distal to this [8,13,14].
CONCLUSIONS
The main absorption site of ciprofloxacin is the duodenum and the upper part of the small intestine. The amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed from the gastroin-

testinal tract progressively decreases from the upper to lower regions of the small intestine and is drastically reduced in the colon. The metabolite profile for ciprofloxacin in urine is independent of the absorption site. The reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin in the lower bowel does not appear to be due to differences in pre-hepatic metabolism along the gastrointestinal tract.
