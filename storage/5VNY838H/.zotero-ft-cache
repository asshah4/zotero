Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is deﬁned by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of other potentially causative cardiac, systemic, syndromic, or metabolic diseases. Symptoms can be related to a range of pathophysiologic mechanisms including left ventricular outﬂow tract obstruction with or without signiﬁcant mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction with heart failure with preserved and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, autonomic dysfunction, ischemia, and arrhythmias. Appropriate understanding and utilization of multimodality imaging is fundamental to accurate diagnosis as well as longitudinal care of patients with HCM. Resting and stress imaging provide comprehensive and complementary information to help clarify mechanism(s) responsible for symptoms such that appropriate and timely treatment strategies may be implemented. Advanced imaging is relied upon to guide certain treatment options including septal reduction therapy and mitral valve repair. Using both clinical and imaging parameters, enhanced algorithms for sudden cardiac death risk stratiﬁcation facilitate selection of HCM patients most likely to beneﬁt from implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillators.

PREAMBLE
Since the publication of the recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 2011, an impressive growth and evolution of imaging techniques has occurred, enhancing both the recognition and management of the disease.1 This update from the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE), American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC), Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR), and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) provides a contemporary practical framework for the utilization of multimodality imaging in the care of HCM patients. Metabolic disorders that mimic HCM are only included in the differential diagnosis, where appropriate, and are not the focus of this document.
INTRODUCTION
HCM is deﬁned by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the absence of other potentially causative cardiac, systemic, syndromic, or metabolic diseases.2 It is the most common genetic abnormality of the myocardium, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1:500 to as high as 1:200.3-5 Predominantly recognized as a disease caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, HCM has a wide range of clinical expression and disease penetrance. Many individuals with HCM have a normal life expectancy and are relatively free of symptoms, while an important minority suffers debilitating symptoms and/or premature mortality.2,6 Symptoms can be related to a range of pathophysiologic mechanisms including diastolic dysfunction,7,8 heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF),9,10 left ventricular outﬂow tract (LVOT) obstruction11,12 with or without signiﬁcant mitral regurgitation (MR),13 autonomic dysfunction,14 ischemia,15,16 and arrhythmias.17,18
Appropriate understanding and utilization of multimodality imaging is fundamental to accurate diagnosis as well as longitudinal care of patients with HCM. Novel echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques have improved differentiation of HCM from other causes of LVH.19-22 Such reﬁnements in conjunction with serial imaging have broadened our perspective of the penetrance of disease expression in HCM mutation carriers.23 Resting and stress imaging provides both comprehensive and complementary information to help clarify mechanism(s) responsible for nonspeciﬁc symptoms such that appropriate and timely treatment strategies may be implemented. Advanced imaging is relied upon to guide certain treatment options including septal reduction therapy (SRT) and mitral valve repair. Using both clinical and imaging parameters, enhanced algorithms for sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratiﬁcation facilitate selection of HCM patients most likely to beneﬁt

from implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillators (ICD), resulting in dramatically improved prognosis.6,24
SECTION 1: MULTIMODALITY IMAGING FOR THE EVALUATION OF SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED HCM
A. Assessment of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy
Accurate quantiﬁcation of the magnitude, location, and pattern of LVH is essential for the diagnosis and management of patients. Wall thickness $15 mm in the absence of other causes of hypertrophy in a non-dilated left ventricle (LV) deﬁnes HCM.2 End diastolic wall thickness $13 mm can be diagnostic if there is a family history of HCM or a known disease-causing genetic mutation. Risk of SCD correlates with the magnitude of hypertrophy. Massive LVH ($30 mm, which occurs in about 10% of individuals with HCM) has been used as a threshold for ICD implantation, although the relationship between the degree of hypertrophy and the risk of SCD is a continuous one. In addition, the location and pattern of increased wall thickness can predict the probability of a positive genetic test.25
In the pediatric population, it is essential to consider that because of somatic growth, a single cut-off value cannot be applied across patients of different ages and sizes. Cardiac measurements are expressed as z-scores, representing standard deviations from a patient sizespeciﬁc mean value, with hypertrophy diagnosed at z score >2.26,27
The development of hypertrophy is a dynamic process. An abnormal increase in LV wall thickness in childhood is uncommon and should prompt consideration of phenocopies (Table 1) or double gene mutations. Hypertrophy usually accelerates in adolescence. While there are many different phenotypic expressions of HCM, hypertrophy is usually asymmetric, affecting non-contiguous LV segments, and occasionally the right ventricle (RV).28 Focal asymmetric hypertrophy of the basal anterior septum, deﬁned as septal/posterior wall thickness >1.3 in a normotensive patient, is the most common pattern of hypertrophy. Variants include a sigmoid septum, reversed septal curvature, concentric, mid-wall, and apical hypertrophy (Figure 1 and Video 1). The positivity rate of genetic testing differs with each pattern of increased wall thickness, with the lowest yield occurring in patients with sigmoid septum and highest in patients with a reversed septal curvature pattern.25 Furthermore, patients with a pathogenic mutation have greater wall thickness compared with mutation-negative individuals, which may partially account for the higher rate of adverse events in this cohort.29 All imaging modalities should report the pattern and distribution of hypertrophy along with the location and magnitude of maximal wall thickness at end-diastole.
1. Echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial imaging modality of choice in HCM. Care should be taken to avoid LV foreshortening in the apical views, especially in cases with apical hypertrophy. The apical, anterior, and anterolateral walls can be challenging to visualize and accurately measure their thickness. Thus, there should be a low threshold to use ultrasound enhancing agents (UEA) if visualization is not optimal. This is particularly important if the pre-test probability is high, such as when screening family members of gene-positive individuals or in the presence of concerning electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns such as deep lateral T-wave inversion. Wall measurements obtained with UEA may be more reproducible than those obtained without and are more closely aligned to measurements obtained by CMR.30 Additionally, UEA may facilitate identiﬁcation of myocardial crypts, apical aneurysms, and ventricular thrombi, and can facilitate myocardial target localization for alcohol septal ablation. Systematic identiﬁcation and exclu-

sion of RV structures (including trabeculation, moderator band, and crista supraventricularis) is advised when measuring the interventricular septum (IVS). Long-axis views can overestimate wall thickness due to tangential cuts through the wall and potential inclusion of other structures such as trabeculations or papillary muscles in the measurements (Figure 2). Therefore, it is important to integrate and cross-reference short- and long-axis views to optimally align measurements.31,32 High-quality three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is superior to 2D in the evaluation of LV mass and more closely correlated with CMR assessment.33,34 The RV free wall should be measured in subcostal views at end-diastole with care to avoid inclusion of epicardial fat.32
2. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance. CMR’s contribution is of particular importance because of high spatial resolution and tissue characterization.35 Still, care should be taken to avoid erroneous measurements from long-axis views (Figure 3). These capabilities confer diagnostic sensitivity when LVH is near diagnostic or therapeutic thresholds, atypical or complex in distribution, and in patients with technically challenging echocardiographic studies. As a component of the wider clinical and imaging assessment, tissue characterization (late gadolinium enhancement [LGE], T1 and T2 mapping) can help differentiate between increased wall thickness due to HCM and other conditions such as athletic remodeling, hypertension, inﬂammation, and inﬁltration (Table 1).36,37
3. Cardiac Computed Tomography. Claustrophobic patients and/or patients with CMR-incompatible cardiac devices may not be suitable for CMR. In these cases, cardiac CT should be considered. Because of its high 3D resolution, cardiac CT can accurately depict morphological features of HCM, including regional wall thickness, LV mass, and global LV contractile function.38,39 In addition, cardiac CT visualizes the size and course of septal perforators within the myocardium, which is of potential interest in preparation for percutaneous SRT.40 Of note, standard coronary CT angiograms acquired during mid-diastole will overestimate wall thickness compared to images acquired at end-diastole.
4. Cardiac Nuclear Imaging. Nuclear imaging is not needed for the evaluation of wall thickness given its low spatial resolution and exposure to radiation, in comparison with the high spatial resolution and the lack of exposure to radiation with echocardiography and CMR.
B. Differentiating HCM from Phenocopies
While clinical context is key, there are many situations where features on the echocardiogram alone can raise suspicion of speciﬁc disease processes or narrow the differential diagnosis and guide downstream testing. Features such as asymmetric hypertrophy or dynamic LVOT obstruction (LVOTO) are more commonly seen in HCM than in other pathologies but are not pathognomonic. Correlation with the 12-lead ECG and clinical history is recommended to narrow the differential diagnosis and guide selection of further advanced imaging (Figure 4).
1. Athlete’s Heart Versus HCM. Most of the literature aimed at distinguishing these entities compares athletes to sedentary HCM patients with clear phenotypic expression. These data are limited in separating physiology from pathology in the true ‘‘gray-zone’’ athlete. In such clinical scenarios it is important to appreciate the pretest probability where, for example, an athlete who has a family history of HCM or presents with concerning symptoms requires a higher degree

of suspicion than an asymptomatic athlete who presents via preparticipation screening. An understanding of the electrical adaptations seen on the 12-lead ECG in athletes is required to differentiate normal from pathological changes seen in HCM such as inferolateral T wave inversion, ST-segment depression or Q waves. It is important to note that between 5 and 10% of individuals with HCM will have a normal electrocardiogram.41,42 The magnitude of exercise-induced hypertrophy is dependent on multiple factors including the duration, type and intensity of exercise pursued as well as the athlete’s age, body mass index (BMI), race, and gender.43 Physiologic hypertrophy is more commonly seen in athletes involved in sports with both high dynamic and static components and in black male athletes. It is rare for LV wall thickness to exceed 12 mm in Caucasian athletes while the upper threshold of normal in elite black male athletes may be close to 15 mm.43,44 Concentric hypertrophy is usually considered abnormal in female athletes yet can be seen in up to a third of black male athletes.43,45,46 Therefore, a knowledge of the expected range and pattern of wall thickness for that individual athlete is useful. A history of hypertension and use of anabolic steroids should also be explored.
Features more consistent with physiologic hypertrophy include ventricular dilation with a uniform pattern of thickening (<2 mm difference in wall thickness between contiguous segments), normal diastolic function, normal mitral valve anatomy without obstruction, either at rest or with exercise, and preserved functional capacity. It

is increasingly appreciated that normal diastolic function and functional capacity can also be seen in athletes with HCM.42,47 Compared to age-matched sedentary controls with HCM, athletes with HCM appear to have less severe disease expression with milder
degrees of LVH, a higher prevalence of apical HCM, and lower prevalence of LVOTO.42 It remains unclear what role longitudinal strain plays in differentiating athletic HCM patients from athletes with
physiologic hypertrophy, as published studies mostly compared athletes with sedentary HCM patients. LV mechanical dispersion and left atrial (LA) strain may hold promise in the future.20 Exercise stress
echocardiography may also have a role in differentiating HCM patients from athletes in the pediatric age group, as they develop LVOT obstruction during submaximal exercise, which is different from athletes.48
CMR should be pursued in any athlete if there is ongoing concern after the initial evaluation. The presence of LGE, abnormalities in the mitral valve and subvalvular anatomy, abnormally prolonged T1 time,
and abnormally increased extracellular volume fraction favor the diagnosis of HCM.49 In addition, there are emerging data showing LGE at RV insertion points in athletes.50,51
Regression of hypertrophy with detraining has been promulgated as a means of distinguishing these entities. However, there are limited normative data on the expected rate of regression. Furthermore, there
are reports that regression may also occur in detrained athletes with HCM.52

Panels A and B are representative parasternal long-axis (PLAX) and short-axis (PSAX) images, respectively, which demonstrate inaccurate IVS measurement (blue line) that included right ventricular (RV) trabeculation. Comparison of the PLAX and PSAX views can help differentiate the true contractile IVS (red line) from RV trabeculation.

stolic dysfunction. Wall thickness may be similar, as the mean septal and posterior wall thicknesses in the ATTR-ACT trial in ATTR (transthyretin) amyloidosis was 17 mm. AL (immunoglobulin light chain)

cardiac amyloidosis usually has slightly lower wall thickness compared with ATTR amyloidosis at the time of diagnosis.53,54 Additional common echocardiographic ﬁndings in cardiac amyloidosis include low tissue Doppler e’ and s’ velocities and abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) with an apical sparing pattern.22,55 Longitudinal strain assessment is paramount in patients with increased LV wall thickness, as regional strain patterns have been shown to help reclassify 22% of patients correctly with the largest improvement seen in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.22 CMR ﬁndings characteristic of cardiac amyloidosis include diffuse subendocardial or transmural LGE, abnormal myocardial nulling, and extracellular volume expansion (Table 1). Technetium-based bone scintigraphy (technetium pyrophosphate in the United States) has high accuracy for the diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis. Other diseases that should be considered in the differential diagnosis are shown in Table 1.56,57
Recommendations and Key Points
1- Echocardiography is the initial imaging modality for evaluation of the presence, magnitude, and pattern of LV hypertrophy and UEA should be used whenever needed.
2- CMR is indicated in patients with suboptimal echocardiographic images, and patients with borderline LV hypertrophy.
3- If CMR is contraindicated or could not be performed, cardiac CT is considered next.
4- Irrespective of which imaging modality is used, the report should comment on the pattern and extent of LV hypertrophy including maximum wall thickness.
C. Assessment of Left Ventricular Systolic Function
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is normal to hyperdynamic in the majority of patients with HCM.58 LV dysfunction, deﬁned as an EF<50%, has been noted in 4-9% of reported

cohorts, and is associated with high rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation.59 Echocardiography remains the predominant method of assessing LV systolic function with EF being the most commonly reported quantitative measure. Assessment of LV systolic function can be challenging in patients with large apical aneurysms. Variability in EF measurements can be substantial even with quantitative biplane techniques, and the use of UEA improves concordance with EF measured by CMR. Lower limits of normal LV EF depend on the method used (2D versus 3D). However, these data were obtained from normal subjects and not patients with HCM and thus are not necessarily applicable to HCM patients. The writing group endorses 50% as the lower limits of normal, be it with 2D or 3D echocardiographic imaging given the absence of data in this patient population. In patients with suboptimal echocardiographic imaging, despite the use of UEA, CMR plays an important role. Multiphase cardiac CT correlates well with CMR quantiﬁcation of LVEF and can be considered in patients in whom CMR is not possible.60
Unlike EF, systolic strain (including global longitudinal strain) and strain rate demonstrate a range of regional and global abnormalities in HCM (Figure 5), even in patients with normal wall motion and EF.61-63 Systolic strain and strain rate abnormalities appear to colocate mostly, but not exclusively, with regions of hypertrophy and are noted in the septum in classic septal hypertrophy and in the apex in the apical variant. Systolic global longitudinal strain predicts event-free survival in HCM patients with normal EF. Measures such as systolic strain rate are also useful in characterizing the myocardial mechanical response with exercise stress.64 Systolic strain rates are lower in HCM than in normal healthy individuals and the augmentation of systolic strain rate with exercise is signiﬁcantly blunted in obstructive and non-obstructive HCM patients. Moreover, peak systolic strain rate correlates with exercise capacity and is

inversely related to the burden of scar as quantiﬁed by percent LGE by CMR.64
Similarly, feature-tracking cardiac magnetic resonance (FT-CMR) is one of several CMR imaging techniques used to assess myocardial strain. It tracks features of interest along contour lines on routinely acquired cine images, following the same basic premise of speckle tracking echocardiography. Its main advantage, relevant for clinical adoption, is that, as a postprocessing CMR technique of routinely acquired steady-state free precision sequences, there is no need for additional image acquisition. It has been shown to aid in differentiation between HCM and hypertensive heart disease,65 and detection of abnormal strain in preclinical (prior to development of hypertrophy) and pediatric patients.66,67
As in the adult population, in children with HCM, LVEF is normal to hyperdynamic in most patients. There are some differences when looking at deformation parameters, with reduced longitudinal strain and strain rates when assessed segmentally but with global values remaining within normal range in a larger proportion of pediatric cases.68 With regard to torsion, some pediatric studies have shown altered basal rotation but with preserved and even increased apical rotation.69

Recommendations and Key Points
1- Assessment of LVEF should be performed in all HCM patients using echocardiography, with or without UEA, at the time of diagnosis and when there is a signiﬁcant change in clinical condition. There should be a low threshold for using imaging modalities such as CMR or CT for LV systolic function assessment when echocardiographic images are suboptimal.
2- Assessment of global longitudinal strain adds important prognostic data and may be performed in centers with experience and expertise with using strain echocardiography.
D. Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function Diastolic dysfunction occurs in HCM patients due to impaired LV relaxation and increased myocyte and chamber stiffness. In addition, abnormal LA function, in part due to an atrial myopathy, can be an important cause of impaired LV ﬁlling. Diastolic dysfunction accounts, in part, for the symptomatic status of patients with and without obstruction. It is not practical to perform cardiac catheterization to assess LV diastolic function in most patients, and thus noninvasive

imaging has become the standard approach to diagnose and identify the presence of abnormally elevated LV ﬁlling pressures.70-72 Assessment of abnormal LV ﬁlling patterns is affected by both LV relaxation and transmitral pressure gradient. Echocardiography allows for the dissection of hemodynamic determinants of LV ﬁlling and is usually the only test utilized for that objective. Notwithstanding, there are emerging data showing the feasibility of measurement of mitral annulus velocities by CT and CMR, albeit not tested speciﬁcally in patients with HCM.73,74
Identiﬁcation of diastolic dysfunction, similar to other cardiovascular conditions, requires a comprehensive approach.75 It includes mitral inﬂow velocities recorded at the annulus (for mitral A duration) and leaﬂet tips, early diastolic velocity by tissue Doppler at the septal and lateral sides of the mitral annulus, peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity measured by CW Doppler from multiple windows, biplane LA maximum volume index, and pulmonary vein velocities. Mitral regurgitation (MR) of at least moderate severity can affect LA volumes and E/e’ ratio, irrespective of LA pressure. Thus, in the absence of $moderate MR, LA maximum volume index, average E/e’ ratio, and peak TR velocity should be considered in reaching conclusions about LA pressure. In the presence of signiﬁcant MR, peak TR velocity and pulmonary vein atrial reversal velocity are the more reliable indices of LV ﬁlling pressures. In particular, Ar-A duration >30 ms is consistent with increased LV end diastolic pressure (Figures 6 and 7). A number of studies have associated a restrictive LV ﬁlling pattern and increased E/e’ ratio in HCM patients with heart failure hospitalizations, reduced exercise tolerance in children and adults, and SCD.76-80 In patients with atrial ﬁbrillation, the speciﬁc measurements recommended in the ASE 2016 diastolic function guideline should be considered.75 Thus, a short deceleration time is indicative of increased LA pressure when EF is depressed. For normal LVEF, isovolumic relaxation time, peak acceleration of mitral E velocity, septal E/e’ ratio, deceleration time of pulmonary vein diastolic velocity, and peak TR velocity are the variables that should be considered, although data in HCM patients with atrial ﬁbrillation are very limited.

There are growing data showing the association of LA reservoir, conduit, and pump (contractile) strain with reduced exercise tolerance, and subsequent development of atrial ﬁbrillation.81-83 However, there is a paucity of data on the hemodynamic determinants of LA strain in HCM and the impact of inter-vendor differences in LA strain measurements and whether these are equivalent or not.84 At the present time, it is reasonable to record and report LA strain values when serial analysis is performed by the same software for a given patient. Interestingly, CMR studies have shown a high burden of atrial ﬁbrosis in HCM patients, which likely accounts for the abnormal LA function.85
More recently, the speed of propagation of extrinsically generated shear waves was shown to be higher in children and adults with HCM when compared to normal controls, likely reﬂecting higher myocardial stiffness.7 While promising, these studies are few and lack validation with invasive measurements. The speed of propagation is affected not only by intrinsic stiffness but also loading conditions and wall thickness. In addition, shear wave propagation speed is measured only in the septum and given the heterogeneity of myocardial structure and function in HCM, it remains to be seen if a local measurement can be reﬂective of global function.
The assessment of diastolic dysfunction in children remains a challenge. The adult guidelines should not be applied to the pediatric population, including the cutoff values for the different diastolic parameters.86 While there are published normal data by age groups for all parameters, the normal range is very wide. The assessment of left atrial strain and function as well as stiffness analysis by shear wave imaging show promising results in the pediatric population but require further studies and validation.87,88
Recommendations and Key Points
1- A comprehensive approach is recommended for the evaluation of diastolic function in HCM.
2- Diastolic function assessment includes mitral inﬂow velocities recorded at annulus and leaﬂet tip levels, early diastolic velocity by tissue Doppler

E. Assessment of Dynamic Obstruction and Mitral Valve Anatomy Left ventricular outﬂow tract obstruction (LVOTO) commonly occurs in patients with HCM. Resting LVOTO, considered signiﬁcant with a peak gradient $30 mm Hg, is present in about 30-35% of symptomatic patients with HCM. In another 30-35%, obstruction is latent and only inducible by provocative maneuvers (e.g., Valsalva or amyl nitrite inhalation). If bedside maneuvers fail to induce LVOTO then exercise echocardiography is recommended.89 The remaining 30% of patients do not have either a resting or provoked LVOT gradient and are classiﬁed as having nonobstructive HCM.90,91

The presence of a resting peak LVOT gradient $30 mm Hg is associated with increased risk of SCD and progression to New York Heart Association Class III or IV symptoms of heart failure.92 Resting or provoked gradients of $50 mm Hg are considered a threshold for invasive therapy in patients who exhibit drug-refractory symptoms.2,93
Notably, LVOTO in HCM is a labile and dynamic phenomenon that can vary depending on LV afterload, preload, and contractility.94,95
The main structural abnormalities contributing to LVOTO are
septal hypertrophy, narrowing of the LVOT, and mitral valve (MV)
and subvalvular apparatus abnormalities. Many patients with obstruc-
tive HCM have elongation of both mitral valve leaﬂets, and patients
with obstructive cardiomyopathy have longer leaﬂets than patients
with non-obstructive HCM. Elongated leaﬂets extend further into
the LV cavity and coapt at the body of the leaﬂets rather than at the leaﬂet tips.96,97 The residual portion of the anterior leaﬂet extends
past the coaptation point, which contributes to the predisposition toward systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve13,98
(Figure 8). Uncommonly, isolated elongation of the posterior mitral valve leaﬂet can lead to SAM.13
Furthermore, abnormalities of papillary muscles frequently
contribute to development of SAM and dynamic LVOTO. Anterior

(Right) PLAX. Biﬁd papillary muscle (white arrow) inserting directly to the underbelly of the anterior mitral valve leaﬂet leading to LVOT obstruction.

or apical displacement of the papillary muscle results in chordal-leaﬂet laxity, which in turn contributes to SAM.97 Other papillary muscle abnormalities identiﬁed in patients with HCM include biﬁd papillary muscle (70% of HCM patients on CMR) (Figure 9), anomalous insertion of papillary muscle directly into the anterior leaﬂet (13% of patients), hypertrophy of the papillary muscles,99,100 hypermobile accessory papillary muscles101 and, less commonly, presence of accessory chords to the body of A2 segment of the anterior mitral leaﬂet. Descriptions of these variations should be included in the imaging report to help guide surgical planning.
SAM is the result of drag forces on the anterior mitral valve leaﬂet, pushing it toward the LVOT. The development of SAM can begin at normal LVOT velocity, preceding systolic ﬂow acceleration in the LVOT. In addition to drag forces on the mitral leaﬂets, Venturi forces created as ﬂow enters the narrowed LVOT may contribute to obstruction. Although Venturi forces are present in the LVOT, they are not the primary cause of SAM. Rather, a larger leaﬂet area and length predispose the mitral valve leaﬂets to be swept anteriorly, closer to the septum by drag forces.102 Although SAM is commonly described in patients with HCM, it is not speciﬁc to this disease. It can occur in other conditions provoked by reduced afterload, increased inotropic state, or reduced preload.103-108 An example of this is the postoperative repair of a myxomatous mitral valve in a patient with basal septal hypertrophy or sigmoid septum, in which the LV is underﬁlled coming off bypass. In this situation, a number of factors converge and produce SAM along with LVOTO. These include elongated mitral leaﬂets, a narrow LVOT, a small LV cavity, and hyperdynamic ventricle. In general, these can be reversed with volume loading, afterload increase, and cessation of inotropic agent administration. Similarly, SAM with dynamic obstruction can be seen in patients on inotropic drugs who are volume depleted, particularly if elderly with basal septal hypertrophy. Careful clinical assessment and supplemental information are needed to establish the etiology of SAM/LVOTO. Conditions other than HCM resulting in SAM and LVOTO are listed in Table 2.

1. Echocardiographic Techniques in the Evaluation of Left Ventricular Outﬂow Tract Obstruction
The echocardiographic report, in addition to quantiﬁcation of LVOTO and mitral valve regurgitation, should contain a clear statement about anatomy of the mitral valve, the degree of SAM, the effect of provocative maneuvers on the degree of obstruction, and papillary muscle morphology.1 Thorough evaluation requires utilization of multiple echocardiographic techniques.
i. M Mode. Prior to the development of Doppler echocardiography, the degree of LVOTO was evaluated by determining the presence and duration of SAM by M-mode echocardiography.109 The severity of SAM was categorized by SAM-septal distance and the duration of leaﬂet-septal contact: (1) mild: SAM-septal distance >10 mm; (2) moderate: SAM-septal distance #10 mm, or brief mitral leaﬂetseptal contact (<30% of systolic duration); and (3) severe: prolonged SAM-septal contact, lasting $30% of systole.110 In addition, M mode may depict mid-systolic notching of the aortic valve, which is caused by the attenuation in blood ﬂow as obstruction develops.111 (Figure 10).
ii. Color Flow and Pulsed-Wave Doppler. Once SAM is identiﬁed by M-mode and 2D imaging, color ﬂow (CF) Doppler is used to localize turbulent, aliased ﬂow indicating increased velocity (Figure 11). Pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler can be utilized to interrogate velocities sequentially and systematically from the LV apex all the way to the LVOT in order to conﬁrm the anatomical level of obstruction; however, this is also usually apparent with color Doppler, which is less time consuming. Localization of obstruction using PW Doppler is done in the apical 5-chamber view (A5C) and/or apical three-chamber view (A3C). In the body of the LV, PW Doppler has a typical shape of a low-velocity, late-peaking envelope (Figure 12). If LVOTO is severe, usually >60 mm Hg at rest, a phenomenon called ‘‘lobster-claw’’ abnormality can be seen.98,112 (Figure 12) This characteristic Doppler envelope has two low

velocity systolic components; the ﬁrst one early in systole, which rapidly decelerates due to afterload mismatch, and the second one late in systole when ﬂow resumes after LVOT obstruction is relieved. The onset of rapid deceleration of the early systolic ﬂow corresponds to the initial leaﬂet-septal contact and a notch in the aortic valve, as described above. The nadir of ﬂow deceleration corresponds to peak of the LVOT gradient.
When a localized sudden increase in velocity and aliasing are present, a change to high pulse repetition frequency (HPRF) Doppler could be considered to further evaluate ﬂow velocities and the shape of the velocity waveform.113
iii. Continuous-Wave Doppler. Typically, in HCM, outﬂow velocities increase slowly in early systole, then rise abruptly and peak in mid-to-late systole, resulting in a characteristic ‘‘dagger-shaped’’ envelope (Figure 13). Maximal instantaneous gradient, reﬂecting severity of the obstruction, is determined by measuring the peak LVOT velocity using CW Doppler and calculated with the simpliﬁed Bernoulli equation (LVOT gradient = 4 X [LVOT velocity]2). There is excellent correlation between the pressure gradient determined by CW Doppler and the LVOT gradient obtained by cardiac catheterization. Variations in waveform conﬁguration in HCM can be encountered. Occasionally, the rate of increase in velocities in early systole is more rapid and the peak velocity is achieved earlier in systole, producing a more symmetrically shaped envelope114 (Figure 14). However, the shape of both envelopes, mid- and late-peaking, is distinctly different from the Doppler spectral proﬁle of ﬁxed valvular aortic stenosis.
iv. Transesophageal Echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended in patients with poor transthoracic echocardiographic windows and/or difﬁculty in establishing the etiology of LVOTO, mitral valve and papillary muscle abnormalities, and/or mechanism of mitral valve regurgitation (Figure 15). In particular, the mid-esophageal and transgastric long axis views can provide detailed assessment of the mitral valve apparatus.

v. Three-Dimensional echocardiography. Three-dimensional technology has been successfully applied in imaging of SAM and associated abnormalities during TTE and TEE examinations (Video 2).115
2. Pitfalls and Challenges in the Evaluation of Left Ventricular Outﬂow Tract Obstruction
i. Mitral Regurgitation. Because of the close anatomic proximity, it can be hard to distinguish high-velocity LVOT ﬂow from that of MR, which is usually present in patients with SAM. Efforts should be made to isolate, record, and label the MR signal by sweeping the CW Doppler beam away from the LVOT and directly into the MR jet. Anteriorly directed jets of MR can be particularly difﬁcult to differentiate from the LVOT signal and can require steep probe tilting and off-axis imaging to align the Doppler beam out of the LA. Although the MR envelope in HCM can have slight acceleration of ﬂow at the time of SAM, and both ﬂows can peak in mid-systole, the MR velocity waveform usually peaks earlier than that of LVOT ﬂow. The duration of MR may be longer, often beginning during isovolumic contraction although, in HCM, MR may only begin with SAMinduced leaﬂet separation in mid-to-late systole. Overall, the MR envelope is more rounded, and the velocity is always higher than LVOT velocity (Figure 16). Caution is advised when interpreting a ﬂow velocity higher than 5.5 m/s as representing the LVOT signal, when this high-velocity ﬂow could be consistent with MR.114 The LVOT gradient also can be estimated using the systolic blood pressure and the MR velocity, as illustrated in Figure 17. As a general rule, the difference in peak gradient between the MR jet (LV systolic pressure) and LVOTO jet should be close to the systolic blood pressure (ignoring left atrial pressure results in a lower estimate of LV outﬂow tract gradient). The stand-alone CW Doppler probe may be useful and sometimes, depending on the degree of anterior angulation of the LVOT, an accurate gradient may be obtained from a high right parasternal or suprasternal view.
ii. Discrete Subvalvular Stenosis. Discrete subvalvular stenosis (DSS) can be encountered as an isolated abnormality or as a component of a more complicated congenital condition, most notably Shone complex. Findings that favor the diagnosis of DSS include an early peaking LVOT signal and the presence of associated aortic regurgitation. TTE may be sufﬁcient to make a diagnosis by visualizing a membrane or circumferential narrowing of LVOT commonly involving the base of the anterior mitral leaﬂet, but DSS can be associated with septal hypertrophy and turbulence with ﬂow acceleration in the LVOT and may be mistaken for HCM. M-mode depiction of systolic notching of the aortic valve is not a speciﬁc ﬁnding for HCM and it may occur in a variety of other conditions where a drop in LV ejection velocity may be encountered.116 The absence of SAM suggests the presence of ﬁxed rather than dynamic obstruction117,118 (Figure 18).
iii. Hyperdynamic LV Function. In patients with a hyperdynamic LV and concomitant cavity obliteration, CW Doppler can demonstrate very late-peaking systolic ﬂow acceleration.105,114 Color and PW Doppler can localize the origin of this ﬂow to the area of cavity obliteration.119 This is distinctly different from the mid-to-late-peaking, daggershaped high-velocity ﬂow characteristic of HCM. Careful assessment of the associated clinical presentation is necessary to appropriately

diagnose patients, as many conditions with a hyperdynamic LV can be associated with mid-cavitary gradients in the absence of HCM.
iv. Concomitant Aortic Valve Stenosis. The presence of aortic stenosis (AS) coexisting with obstructive HCM is a diagnostic challenge that requires meticulous echocardiographic assessment to establish the correct diagnosis. It is particularly important to evaluate the severity of each condition to recommend the appropriate therapeutic plan. Careful 2D imaging of the valve, assessing leaﬂet thickening/calciﬁcation and restricted leaﬂet motion, is important in identifying intrinsic aortic valve pathology. In addition, color Doppler can identify the area of turbulence and PW Doppler conﬁrms the level of obstruction by localizing ﬂow acceleration. AS is a ﬁxed obstruction, hence the shape of the CW Doppler envelope is usually early peaking and triangular in mild stenosis and rounded, peaking in mid-systole, in more severe stenosis. It differs from dynamic LVOTO where a mid-to-latepeaking dagger-shaped envelope is encountered. Both envelopes might be superimposed since they are tandem stenoses120 (Figure 19). Furthermore, the severity of dynamic obstruction can be uncovered after aortic valve replacement which decreases afterload.
In a patient with concomitant AS and HCM, use of the continuity equation is not recommended to calculate aortic valve area. Direct planimetry by TEE, CT, or CMR should be considered. The simpliﬁed Bernoulli equation to calculate peak AS gradient cannot be used in serial stenoses. When peak velocity in the LVOT exceeds 1.5 m/s, the peak aortic gradient can be calculated using the formula: 4(V22 max-V12 prox). Invasive hemodynamic evaluation is recommended if a deﬁnitive diagnosis cannot be established by imaging.121
Recommendations and Key Points
1- LVOT obstruction occurs in 70-75% of patients, where there is either a resting or provoked LVOT gradient. A systematic approach using provocative maneuvers can differentiate non-obstructive from obstructive phenotype. (Figure 20).
2- Most patients with HCM and LVOTO have abnormalities of the mitral valvular and subvalvular apparatus. SAM is a result of drag forces on elongated mitral valve leaﬂets.

3- SAM/LVOTO is not speciﬁc for HCM and can occur in other conditions provoked by reduced afterload, reduced preload, and increased LV contractility.
4- CW Doppler shows a mid-to-late-systolic peaking, dagger-shaped spectral pattern characteristic of dynamic LVOTO. The LVOT gradient can be determined using the modiﬁed Bernoulli equation: LVOT gradient = 4 X (LVOT velocity)2
5- Dynamic LVOTO obstruction should be differentiated from ﬁxed subvalvular, valvular, or supravalvular stenosis. The CW Doppler envelope in these latter conditions is usually early peaking.
6- The echocardiographic report, in addition to blood pressure, quantiﬁcation of LVOT gradient, and mitral valve regurgitation severity, should contain a clear statement about the anatomy of the mitral valve, the presence of SAM, the effect of provocative maneuvers on LVOT gradient, and papillary muscle abnormalities if present.
3. Provoking Obstruction
LVOTO is dynamic and dramatically inﬂuenced by loading conditions. In patients who do not meet gradient thresholds for consideration of SRT, it is imperative to perform various provocative maneuvers. Imaging in a post-prandial state may also reveal latent obstruction. There are several maneuvers, described below, used to assess for a provocable LVOT gradient.
i. Strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver. The strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, during which there is forced exhalation against a closed airway, results in increased intrathoracic pressure and a decrease in venous return, which can precipitate LVOTO. A limitation to the Valsalva maneuver is the subjective nature of the effort and thus variable response. In general, a Valsalva-induced gradient is less than that induced by exercise.12 A ‘‘goal-directed’’ approach can be considered, where an aneroid manometer (blood pressure cuff) is connected to a disposable 10-mL syringe and the patient instructed to blow into the syringe and maintain a pressure of >40 mm Hg for >10 seconds.122
ii. Squat to Stand. Squat to stand also decreases venous return with a resultant decrease in preload and LV size with worsening

LVOTO. If able, the patient is instructed to squat for 3 seconds and then stand. This maneuver is repeated for approximately 5 cycles.
iii. Amyl Nitrite. Amyl nitrite is a vasodilator that decreases afterload and increases heart rate and can provoke latent LVOTO. Amyl nitrite comes in a glass capsule covered by a protective cloth and is administered by having an individual crush the glass capsule between their ﬁngers and the patient is instructed to inhale the vapors. Amyl nitrite is of limited supply and is not available in many hospitals.
iv. Exercise Stress Echocardiography. Exercise is the most physiologic way to provoke LVOTO. Upright exercise (treadmill or upright bicycle) reﬂects a more physiologic form of exercise and is expected to provoke higher gradients than supine exercise. Exercise in the supine position leads to increased preload and afterload and a lower heart rate response, predisposing to lower provocable gradients.
Although the gradient measured immediately post exercise in a recumbent position may be attenuated when compared to gradients measured in the upright position simultaneously at peak exercise, technical challenges and practical limitations make it reasonable to measure gradients immediately post exercise in the supine position. Dobutamine stress echocardiography is not recommended since it is not a physiologic approach and can result in dynamic gradients even in some normal subjects.
Currently the primary indication to pursue invasive SRT in individuals with obstructive HCM is the persistence of severe symptoms with LVOT gradient $50 mm Hg, despite maximum medical therapy. Therefore, beta blocker and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker therapy should not be withheld prior to exercise.
In the younger pediatric population, it is often difﬁcult to obtain good cooperation for provocative maneuvers (Valsalva or squat to stand). Exercise stress echocardiography is preferred in the pediatric HCM population and can be adequately performed in children over 8 years of age who are cooperative and capable of performing an exercise stress test. It can be used as a tool to identify low risk patients.123
Recommendations and Key Points
1- In symptomatic patients, if a peak instantaneous gradient $50 mm Hg is not obtained, then provocative maneuvers should be pursued. (Figure 20)
4. Mitral regurgitation in HCM
Because the anterior leaﬂet is longer than the posterior leaﬂet, an interleaﬂet gap often occurs during systole, resulting in a posteriorly directed jet of MR, which can be signiﬁcant (moderate or greater severity). The severity of MR is related to the extent of mismatch of anterior and posterior leaﬂet lengths, and the decreased mobility of the posterior leaﬂet.124 In addition, the factors that inﬂuence the severity of dynamic obstruction can also inﬂuence the severity of MR.125
Not all MR associated with HCM is related to SAM. Patients with HCM can have intrinsic valvular abnormalities, such as mitral valve prolapse, leaﬂet thickening secondary to injury from repetitive septal contact or ﬂow turbulence, chordal rupture, chordal elongation or thickening, and leaﬂet destruction due to infective endocarditis.125 The presence of a central or an anteriorly directed jet should prompt careful evaluation of the mitral valve apparatus to identify intrinsic valvular abnormalities, although SAM can be associated with central

and anterior jets in the absence of intrinsic leaﬂet pathology. If the mechanism cannot be deﬁned with TTE, TEE should be considered before invasive therapy.
Variability in the length of the posterior leaﬂet can inﬂuence the direction of SAM-induced MR.126 In addition, due to the eccentricity of the MR jet, quantitative assessment using the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method can lead to erroneous estimation of MR severity. MR regurgitant volume can be calculated in these patients as the difference between LV stroke volume by 2D (LV end diastolic volume - end systolic volume) and systolic RVOT (right ventricular outﬂow tract) ﬂow by PW Doppler (RVOT area multiplied by time velocity integral of ﬂow through RVOT), in the absence of signiﬁcant aortic regurgitation. Alternatively, it can be determined as the difference between diastolic ﬂow across mitral annulus (mitral annulus area multiplied by time velocity integral of ﬂow across the mitral annulus) and systolic RVOT ﬂow.
Echocardiography is the initial imaging modality used to assess the mitral valve as well as the LVOT pressure gradient. CMR is of value in determining the severity of MR by measuring regurgitant volume and fraction. In addition, CMR can provide a detailed assessment of the papillary muscles, which can inﬂuence the surgical approach for symptomatic patients undergoing surgery to treat dynamic LVOTobstruction.
Recommendations and Key Points
1- In most patients with obstructive HCM, mitral regurgitation is related to dynamic obstruction with a posteriorly and laterally directed eccentric jet.
2- In some patients, mitral valve prolapse or ﬂail is the etiology of mitral regurgitation.
3- In some patients, TEE or CMR is needed for better evaluation of the mechanism of MR.
5. Midventricular Obstruction and Apical Aneurysm
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with midventricular obstruction (MVO) is an uncommon but important morphologic subtype of HCM. MVO can be identiﬁed in the presence of two imaging criteria: systolic obliteration of the LV that is unrelated to SAM, and a systolic pressure gradient at midventricular level $30 mm Hg at rest.127 Anatomic substrates of MVO include systolic apposition of the hypertrophied septum with a hypercontractile LV free wall,127 apposition of hypertrophied papillary muscles,128 and midventricular narrowing due to middle-to-apical wall hypertrophy and an apical aneurysm.127 Notably, SAM-related LVOTO and midventricular obstruction may co-exist and can complicate assessment and therapy.127,129 In the prospective multi-center international study (HCM Registry) of over 2600 patients who underwent CMR, MVO with an apical aneurysm was detected in 3%.130 Although MVO is occasionally seen in the pediatric population, the development of an apical aneurysm is very rare in children.
i. Doppler Findings. Patients with isolated MVO have color Doppler-demonstrating turbulence at the midventricular level. CW Doppler may demonstrate high velocities persisting through late systole.127 Alternatively, the spectral Doppler pattern of some patients with MVO shows intracavitary velocities peaking in mid-systole, ending abruptly with rapid deceleration, often not extending into late systole.129,131 For patients with isolated MVO under resting conditions, good correlations usually exist between pressure gradients obtained invasively and by CW Doppler. However, peak Doppler gradients can be lower than those obtained by cardiac catheterization

Applying the modiﬁed Bernoulli equation (4V2) to MR velocity of 7.5 m/s (white arrow), the gradient between left ventricle (LV) and LA is calculated to be 225 mm Hg. Adding assumed LA pressure to the LV/LA gradient leads to the estimation of LV peak systolic pressure. Once systolic blood pressure is known, in this case 170 mm Hg, it can be subtracted from the LV systolic pressure, yielding the LVOT gradient of approximately 75 mm Hg, corresponding with the LVOT velocity of approximately 4.3 m/s (yellow arrow).

in patients with isolated MVO when the Doppler spectral tracing indicates abrupt cessation of ﬂow across the mid-ventricle in midsystole, rendering the pressure gradient inaccessible to Doppler measurement.131 In such cases, a jet in early diastole directed from the apical chamber to the basal LV cavity may also be seen, reﬂecting emptying of the apical cavity through the narrowed mid-LV cavity at the onset of diastole.132 This ‘paradoxical’ early diastolic jet can also be detected as an isolated ﬁnding in a small subset of patients with apical-variant HCM and severe hypokinesis of the apex, where it reﬂects a higher pressure in the sequestered apical cavity being released in early diastole. This early diastolic ﬂow toward the base

may also reﬂect heterogeneity in regional relaxation with more rapid relaxation in the mid ventricle, compared to the apex, creating a diastolic gradient. (Figure 21, and Videos 3 and 4).132
ii. CMR and CT Diagnosis. CMR imaging can help conﬁrm the presence of apical aneurysms when ECG and echocardiographic ﬁndings, raise the possibility of this diagnosis. In addition, CMR can identify small aneurysms that may not have been suspected following echocardiographic examination.133 Post-contrast (gadolinium) imaging can also reveal apical thrombi, as well as delineate the presence and pattern of myocardial scarring in the aneurysm and its contractile

neck. Stress imaging often identiﬁes profound perfusion defects localized at the site of the mid-ventricular aneurysm, and the importance of these defects remains uncertain. Retrospectively gated CT can provide important anatomical and functional information in patients with mid-cavity obstruction in patients with intracardiac devices, and/or in patients who also require CT coronary imaging.
iii. Clinical Implications of MVO. MVO is often underrecognized, and is associated with refractory symptoms, as well as

increased risks for ventricular arrhythmias and premature mortality.127 LV thrombi may form within the aneurysmal sac and increase the risk of thromboembolic events.134 An apical aneurysm is now
included in risk assessment algorithms for SCD and is a Class 2a indication for implantation of a prophylactic ICD.2 When associated with
symptoms, the majority of patients are managed with negative
inotropic agents. Favorable surgical results have been reported in pa-
tients with MVO, where the obstruction was relieved by means of a
myectomy via a transaortic approach, a transapical approach, or

combined transaortic and transapical incisions.135 In some patients, invasive septal reduction (either surgical or ablative) for SAMrelated LVOT obstruction may precipitate or exacerbate MVO, by a mechanism thought to reﬂect the effects of afterload reduction (i.e., reduction of the outﬂow gradient) on a susceptible mid-cavity substrate. When anticipated, the risk of this outcome may weigh in favor of recommending an extended surgical myectomy.
Recommendations and Key Points
1- MVO is diagnosed with mid-cavitary obliteration and a systolic gradient $30 mm Hg at rest.
2- Echo with ultrasound enhancing agents or CMR can identify the presence of small apical aneurysms and apical clots. CTA can be used if needed.
3- MVO is associated with higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality.
F. Tissue Characterization Tissue characterization by CMR plays a critical role in HCM assessment. In addition to the established role of LGE in risk stratiﬁcation and prognostication in HCM (Figure 22), CMR provides additional techniques that can aid in tissue characterization such as T1 mapping. T1 relaxation time is measured for each individual pixel of the myocardium and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) is calculated based on the comparison of native T1 values with those obtained following gadolinium-chelate contrast agents, allowing for further tissue characterization and the detection of diffuse interstitial expansion.136 Regional increased native T1 times have been shown to correlate with areas of increased wall thickness and LGE in HCM.137 Moreover, T1 mapping and ECV can help differentiate HCM from hypertensive heart disease, athlete’s heart, Fabry disease, and cardiac amyloidosis,19,49,138 and are associated with adverse outcomes.139 Increased signal intensity on T2 imaging is associated with edema/inﬂammation and potentially increased risk for SCD.140 However, the incremental utility of all these techniques, in terms of prognostic value and risk stratiﬁcation, remains to be determined.
Current echocardiographic techniques are not accurate in detecting myocardial ﬁbrosis, as quantiﬁed by LGE, in children with HCM. But there are data suggesting good negative predictive value of standard imaging.141-143 On the other hand, myocardial stiffness assessment by shear wave imaging has shown a positive correlation with ﬁbrosis markers in LGE-CMR, although additional data in many more patients are needed.7
Recommendations and Key Points
1- LGE by CMR identiﬁes areas of replacement ﬁbrosis. 2- T1 mapping can be used to determine extracellular volume fraction in
HCM patients. 3- LGE patterns and T1 mapping are of value in evaluation of patients with
increased LV wall thickness.
SECTION 2: MULTIMODALITY IMAGING FOR RISK STRATIFICATION AND PROGNOSTICATION
The overall risk of SCD in patients with HCM is low and estimated at 0.5%/year.2,144 In addition to a personal history of ventricular

ﬁbrillation or tachycardia, reasons for consideration of ICD implantation include prior resuscitation for SCD, malignant family history of SCD, unexplained syncope, massive LV wall thickness $30 mm, apical aneurysm, additional imaging features of extensive late LGE on CMR, and LV systolic dysfunction.2 The 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines devised and recommended using an HCM Risk-SCD calculator to assess the 5-year risk of SCD. Using the results, an ICD is recommended with a 5-year risk score $6% (high risk) and can be considered in those with a 5-year risk $4% and <6% (intermediate risk).144,145 The algorithm for the HCM Risk-SCD calculator incorporates age, maximal wall thickness (MWT), LA diameter, and maximal LVOT gradient (either resting or with Valsalva) as continuous variables, along with family history of SCD, NSVT on Holter, and unexplained syncope as binary conditions.145 Recent studies call into question the sensitivity of the algorithm, perhaps due to the lack of inclusion of LGE and apical aneurysms. Inclusion of these features results in a higher sensitivity and smaller numbers needed to treat.
A validated model for SCD risk prediction in pediatric HCM has been recently published and includes age at diagnosis, documented NSVT, unexplained syncope, septal diameter z-score, LV posterior wall diameter z-score, LA diameter z-score, peak LVOT gradient, and presence of a pathogenic variant, with >70% prediction accuracy.146
In the section below, we address the established as well as potential risk modiﬁers of SCD from the perspective of cardiac imaging.
A. Left Ventricular Wall Thickness
The importance of the magnitude of LVH as a risk factor for SCD is well established,147 with maximum wall thickness $30 mm denoting a high risk for SCD while the AHA/ACC 2020 HCM Guideline also proposes that consideration be given to borderline values of $28mm at the discretion of the treating cardiologist.2 Notwithstanding, it is important to recognize that the association between the severity of LVH and risk is linear. Furthermore, data linking the degree of LVH and risk has largely been based on echocardiographic measurements, and wall thickness determined by CMR may reﬁne this association further.31,147
B. Left Atrial Diameter
LA diameter (anteroposterior) was included as a continuous variable in the HCM Risk-SCD calculator, based on one study demonstrating increased risk for SCD with increasing LA diameter.145,148 Other studies have provided conﬂicting results on whether LA diameter is associated with increased risk of SCD or heart failure admissions.80,149,150 LA volume is considered a more accurate assessment of LA size, although only a few small studies have examined its association with outcomes.81,151
C. Left Ventricular Outﬂow Tract Obstruction
Several studies have demonstrated an association between resting LVOTO and SCD.92,152,153 The association between latent obstruction and SCD is not as well described, with some data suggesting that patients with a provoked gradient ($ 90 mm Hg) have worse outcomes than those with less severe provoked gradients (30-89 mm Hg).154 A recent study also demonstrated that, in obstructed HCM patients, SRT was associated with better longer-term outcomes (including SCD) vs. watchful waiting.155 The HCM Risk-SCD calculator includes peak LVOT gradient at rest or with Valsalva regardless

of concurrent medical therapy. Criticisms of this method include the paucity of data regarding the association of provocable gradients with SCD, whether other methods of provocation should have been included, and the dynamic nature of LVOT obstruction.
D. Apical Aneurysm The ability to echocardiographically identify the region of hypertrophy and presence of apical aneurysm and thrombus can be improved

by administering UEA and avoiding foreshortening the LV apex. Therefore, we advocate for the use of UEA in all patients with a possible diagnosis of apical HCM. UEA should also be considered in any patient where there is suspicion of an apical aneurysm, including those with mid-cavity obstruction and apical HCM. CMR may still be necessary to distinguish these features. LGE imaging can also demonstrate transmural myocardial ﬁbrosis and scar,133 and may be additionally useful for identifying an apical thrombus. Major adverse event rates in patients with an apical aneurysm have

been estimated to be between 5 and 15% per year.133,134,156,157 Apical aneurysm, independent of its size, is a risk factor for SCD.
E. Late Gadolinium Enhancement by CMR
Following their administration, gadolinium contrast agents redistribute from the intravascular space to the extracellular space with accumulation in areas with expansion of extracellular space due to either edema or ﬁbrosis, resulting in increased signal intensity on T1 weighted imaging.136 LGE is noted in approximately half of patients with HCM and is commonly described as patchy and midmyocardial within segments of maximal hypertrophy.158-160 Several studies have demonstrated an increased burden of ventricular arrhythmias, SCD, and all-cause mortality in patients who have LGE on CMR.158-161 LGE is also associated with increased heart failure symptoms and admissions, and reduced LVEF in patients with HCM.161,162 Isolated LGE at the RV insertion points does not appear to be associated with increased risk.158
Although LGE is present in >50% of patients with HCM, the overall prevalence of SCD in these patients is far lower.144,163 Thus, recent studies have focused on identifying a cut point for the extent of LGE beyond which there would be a beneﬁt from an ICD. Although multiple studies have been conducted, the heterogeneity of the imaging sequences and postprocessing techniques have made it difﬁcult to implement a precise LGE cutoff.144,163,164 LGE quantiﬁcation techniques include a visual assessment or automatic software quantiﬁcation of signal intensity of affected areas compared to those selected as normal myocardium by visual assessment with cutoffs at 2-6 standard deviations (SD) or full width half maximum (FWHM: region of

interest is manually drawn in the region with hyperenhancement, and enhancement calculated as pixels where signal intensity is > 50% of the automatically determined maximum intensity).165 Although currently no speciﬁc technique is recommended by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,165 prior studies comparing the various techniques have found that either 6 SD or FWHM are preferred in HCM.166,167 Large studies used a threshold of 15% LGE of the LV mass using the 6-SD technique and showed LGE $15% was associated with increased risk of SCD. Repeat CMR may be considered every 3-5 years to evaluate for changes in the magnitude of wall thickness and LGE, and to identify new apical aneurysms or reduction in LVEF.2
We advocate for the incorporation of LGE into the risk assessment for SCD for patients in the ‘‘gray zone’’ (without major American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) risk factors who have other mitigating risk factors, or low-tointermediate risk by the HCM Risk-SCD calculator) to aid in shared decision making since the presence of extensive LGE ($15%) is associated with an increased risk of SCD compared to patients with minimal LGE (Table 3 presents a comprehensive summary of risk markers).
F. Left Ventricular systolic dysfunction.
The 2020 ACC/AHA HCM guidelines recommend (Class 2a) consideration of ICD implantation in individuals with LVejection fraction #50% (2). Although prophylactic ICD implantation is an accepted therapy for primary prevention in HCM patients with systolic dysfunction, these patients were not included in primary

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography Volume 35 Number 6

Nagueh et al 555

prevention ICD trials. If needed, assessment of LVEF using CMR should be considered in this context.
G. Ischemia Autopsy ﬁndings from individuals with HCM-related SCD found a high prevalence of histological changes consistent with acute/subacute myocardial ischemia, possibly forming the substrate for arrhythmogenesis. Flow heterogeneity using positron emission tomography (PET) has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias,168 suggesting a potential role for PET in SCD risk assessment. Given the limited data and associated radiation, we cannot recommend its routine adoption until conﬁrmed with larger studies.
Recommendations and Key Points
1- Imaging provides key data needed for risk stratiﬁcation for SCD. 2- Maximum wall thickness $30 mm, apical aneurysm, LVEF #50%, LGE
$15%, LVOT obstruction, and enlarged LA are imaging ﬁndings associated with higher risk of SCD. 3- An UEA is recommended for patients with MVO or apical HCM to evaluate for apical aneurysms.
SECTION 3: MULTIMODALITY IMAGING IN COMMON CLINICAL SCENARIOS
A. Assessment of Ischemia Chest pain is a common symptom in patients with HCM and may not be related to epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD), with multiple potential factors contributing to inadequate oxygen supply and a higher susceptibility for myocardial ischemia. Oxygen demand is increased because of larger myocardial mass and increased ﬁlling pressures, while oxygen supply is decreased by microvascular dysfunction and medial hypertrophy of the intramural arterioles.169-171 Myocardial bridges are commonly seen in HCM and may contribute to ischemia by prolonged coronary compression and reduced blood ﬂow in the early diastolic phase.172-174 Myocardial blood ﬂow reserve is often reduced, particularly in the endocardial layer, and myocardial ischemia with measurable cardiac troponin can be demonstrated in daily activities.175 Regional blood ﬂow may be further reduced by concomitant atherosclerotic coronary disease, which is associated with worse clinical outcome in HCM.176
1. Echocardiography. Myocardial ischemia in HCM is frequently related to abnormal coronary ﬂow reserve (CFR).177,178 CFR can be evaluated using PW Doppler in the middle left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, and when reduced it is associated with worse outcomes.179,180 The ability of echocardiography (rest or stress) to deﬁne epicardial CAD is limited. The pathophysiology of exerciseinduced wall motion abnormalities (WMA) in HCM is complex and multifactorial,180 and while exercise-induced WMA may have prognostic signiﬁcance, they are not a good predictor of epicardial CAD.181
2. SPECT and PET myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial perfusion imaging with either single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) or PET can deﬁne the presence and severity of ischemia. Stress with either exercise or vasodilators is most commonly used, and typically demonstrates one of three patterns: 1) normal

perfusion; 2) a reversible perfusion defect in the area of greatest hypertrophy; or 3) diffuse subendocardial ischemia from microvascular disease leading to ischemic dilation of the LV and a decrease in EF. Pattern #3 is typically seen with concentric HCM, while focal areas of hypertrophy may demonstrate reversible perfusion defects (Figure 23). Underlying the assessment of all of these patterns is the fact that standard nuclear techniques identify relative myocardial perfusion when compared with areas of normal myocardium. Absolute myocardial blood ﬂow can be quantiﬁed, typically using PET, and may show blunted augmentation of ﬂow during stress when compared with rest, either globally or in the areas of greatest hypertrophy.
Studies using SPECT imaging with thallium-201 have introduced the concept of ischemia in HCM182,183 and its relation to adverse events including cardiac arrest and syncope.184 Moreover, the common treatments for HCM, including calcium channel blockers185 and surgical myectomy,186 have been shown to improve or normalize myocardial perfusion patterns. In general practice, the preferred SPECT radiotracer is now technetium-99m due to a signiﬁcantly shorter half-life (6 hours versus 73 hours for thallium-201) and lower radiation exposure. Due to the long half-life of both agents, stress images are actually acquired 15-60 minutes after peak stress and maximum hyperemia. At that point, stunned myocardium may have recovered, making SPECTassessment of stress-induced wall motion abnormalities suboptimal.
PET myocardial perfusion imaging is superior to conventional SPECT due to its precise built-in attenuation correction that improves image quality and provides for accurate quantitative analysis of myocardial blood ﬂow. Additionally, test duration is shorter due to the relatively short half-lives of the most common radiotracers (rubidium-82: 75 seconds and N-13 ammonia: 10 minutes). Vasodilator injection is performed while the patient is under the camera and images are acquired during hyperemia. This allows for more accurate quantiﬁcation of stress EF, transient ischemic dilatation, and myocardial blood ﬂow reserve.187 About half of the patients with HCM have an abnormal EF response to stress,188 with some showing transient ischemic dilation.189 Resting blood ﬂow is typically normal, although areas with signiﬁcant scar may demonstrate decreased ﬂow.190 Peak stress ﬂow may be blunted due to microvascular disease, leading to decreased blood ﬂow reserve. Maximum wall thickness is one of the strongest predictor of impaired ﬂow reserve,191 although abnormal ﬂow reserve may be seen in both hypertrophied and non-hypertrophied areas of the LV.192 With respect to outcomes, PET-derived blood ﬂow reserve in HCM showing microvascular dysfunction is an independent predictor of clinical deterioration and death193 although, as mentioned previously, these data need to be replicated in larger cohorts.
3. CMR Myocardial Perfusion Imaging. CMR perfusion imaging utilizes a one-pass technique, with a series of images acquired during stress and rest.194,195 Imaging comprises basal, mid, and apical short-axis slices of the LV, but long-axis perfusion imaging may also be useful (Figure 24) across a number of cardiac cycles; a perfusion defect is detected when a regional delay and/or decrease in relative myocardial signal intensity is evident as the contrast bolus passes through the LV myocardium.
Pharmacological stress with intravenous regadenosine or adenosine is the usual method of stress, though exercise stress can be performed with MR-compatible equipment.196 Both semi-quantitative and quantitative techniques are also available,197 with the latter providing pixel-level assessments of myocardial blood ﬂow (MBF)

Figure 23 Example of a patient with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Note the brighter areas of myocardium in the distal lateral wall and apex on the rest images, with decreased perfusion during stress, representing ischemia. There is transient ischemic dilation of the left ventricle with stress, and ﬂow reserve is severely impaired in the distal lateral wall and apex. This pattern often mimics distal left anterior descending coronary artery ischemia.

that correlate with PET-derived MBF but with greater spatial resolution.198 As in PET, utilization of MBF may be able to help differentiate epicardial from microvascular coronary disease. CMR’s ‘multiparametric’ assessment has facilitated identifying the association of perfusion defects/reduced MBF reserve with increased LV mass, LGE, and ECV.199 Reduced MBF reserve with CMR has also been reported in normal appearing segments and in genotype-positive/phenotypenegative hearts in some cases, suggesting that it may be a marker of early disease.194
While subendocardial patterns of LGE are accurate indicators of prior myocardial infarction (MI) in almost all clinical settings, its absence does not exclude coronary disease, and subendocardial LGE can occur in HCM despite culprit-free coronary angiograms; for example, in apical or mid-cavity HCM and following thromboembolic disease. Coronary imaging and contemporaneous myocardial perfusion CMR has been used to establish baseline abnormalities. In this setting, prospective changes in perfusion, function, or LGE imaging may serve as a helpful and safe screening tool, although this strategy remains formally untested.
4. Cardiac CT. Contrast-enhanced, ECG-synchronized computed tomography (CT) of the heart is useful in patients with HCM to noninvasively detect obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, which is present by CT in 7-19% of patients.173,174,200 Cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) has been regarded as the reference standard for imaging anomalous coronary anatomy and myocardial

bridges, the latter being detected in up to half of patients (Figure 25).174 Although radiation exposure is a relative drawback of CCTA in younger HCM patients, the use of contemporary CT technology combined with heart rate modulation can keep doses well below 5mSv. Iodine contrast medium is required, but not recommended in patients with reduced renal function (eGFR <30). HCM does not pose a speciﬁc technical challenge for cardiac CT, although preprocedural nitroglycerin should be avoided when severe LVOTO is present. The diagnostic performance of CCTA for the detection of CAD in HCM is good, and in the same range as reported for general cohorts.201 CCTA performance varies with available CT technology and is best in cooperative patients with a low heart rate and regular rhythm. The ability to rule out obstructive coronary disease decreases in the presence of severe calciﬁcation or coronary stents. Challenges can occur in patients with metal artifacts, coronary stents, and markedly elevated calcium scores.
CT-based fractional ﬂow reserve (CT-FFR) can estimate the functional severity of intermediate-severity coronary lesions detected on CCTA. Commercially available CT-FFR applications have not been validated speciﬁcally in HCM patients. Even in the absence of severe CAD, patients with HCM appear to have slightly lower CT-FFR values in the distal vessels, which may be caused by a disproportionate increase in myocardial mass compared to the coronary capacity.202 In patients with higher myocardial mass, more discrepancy has been noted when comparing an investigational CT-FFR algorithm with invasive FFR.203

B. Assessment of Coronary Artery Disease
Chest discomfort and perfusion abnormalities in the absence of CAD are common in patients with HCM and are not well correlated or understood mechanistically; the presence of CAD is, however, associated with adverse outcomes. There is limited prospective data on CAD testing in HCM, or speciﬁc comparisons between different techniques. Recommendations in this guideline parallel the recent chest pain guidelines based on evidence in the general population but adapted to the context of HCM based on expert consensus.
1. HCM patient with chest discomfort and clinical need to evaluate CAD. The initial step in evaluating a patient with suspected CAD is a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Challenges in patients with HCM include baseline ECG abnormalities and noncoronary causes for symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea. Randomized trials and registries have consistently demonstrated that traditional prediction rules based on age, sex and symptoms, such as the Diamond & Forrester rule, grossly overestimate CAD prevalence in contemporary chest pain cohorts.204-206 For convenience, we recommend an approach that has not been validated in HCM patients, with the expectation of additional overestimation of CAD because of more frequent myocardial ischemia in the absence of epicardial coronary artery stenosis. Heart failure with a possible ischemic etiology lowers the threshold for diagnostic testing.
For patients with a low probability of CAD (<15%), the diagnostic yield of testing is low and a conservative initial approach without testing is appropriate (Figure 26). Other causes of chest discomfort should be considered, but persistent symptoms may necessitate further testing. Because clinically relevant CAD is very rare in the absence of detectable coronary calcium, a calcium scan may be a reasonable ﬁrst test in low-probability patients with nonacute chest discomfort.207-210
For most patients with a low-to-intermediate probability (15-50%), CCTA is an effective approach to evaluate for epicardial CAD or myocardial bridging. Randomized controlled trials in general chest pain populations have demonstrated that cardiac CT is safe, and in some studies is associated with improved outcomes, at the expense of increased coronary angiography rates. To avoid negative invasive

angiograms or revascularizations of low clinical relevance, it is important to note that CCTA tends to overestimate severity compared to invasive angiography, and that moderate angiographic stenosis by CT or cardiac catherization is in many cases not functionally signiﬁcant.
Furthermore, some patients are not good candidates for CCTA. In case of a high probability or known CAD, a functional test may be more efﬁcient to establish management. In the event of safety concerns for radiation or iodine contrast exposure, or circumstances that decrease CCTA performance such as arrhythmia, functional tests may be more appropriate. Because of previously detailed technical limitations of SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and stress echocardiography for the detection of CAD in patients with HCM, quantitative PET or MRI perfusion techniques are preferable when available (Figure 26).
In HCM patients, CAD is associated with adverse outcomes, although no outcome beneﬁt has been prospectively demonstrated from either testing or revascularization. Based on available data, it is reasonable to reserve invasive angiography for cases of severe CAD on CCTA (left main or triple vessel disease) or functional imaging or for patients with persistent symptoms despite medical therapy. Functional assessment of CAD severity is recommended before intervention, either by invasive means (FFR) in the catheterization laboratory, a noninvasive functional test, or CT-FFR in case a CCTA of adequate quality is available. Functional testing is particularly useful if there is discrepancy between symptoms and disease severity.
2. HCM patient with abnormal myocardial perfusion test. If abnormal myocardial perfusion is detected following functional evaluation in symptomatic patients, or in asymptomatic patients as part of a comprehensive imaging evaluation, the question of epicardial CAD should be considered. Patients considered low risk and for whom further testing can be deferred include those without symptoms, low pre-test risk (<15%), normal LVEF, and small ischemic burden (<5% of LV volume, or a defect not well deﬁned by a coronary distribution) (Figure 27). High-risk patients include those with symptoms and a large territorial ischemic defect (>10%) and should be considered for catheter-based coronary angiography or CCTA (with FFR if available) if a noninvasive strategy is preferred. Intermediate-risk patients may be further risk-stratiﬁed noninvasively by CCTA.

Recommendations and Key Points
1- CCTA can be used to noninvasively evaluate the coronary arteries in HCM patients.
2- PET and CMR are the preferred techniques for stress perfusion imaging. 3- Epicardial CAD in HCM patients is associated with worse outcomes.
C. Screening Echocardiography is the best initial imaging modality for HCM screening, in conjunction with clinical evaluation and ECG. For asymptomatic family members of HCM patients, the frequency of screening depends on the age of the family member, whether a pathogenic variant is identiﬁed, and if there is early-onset disease. For children and adolescents from families with known pathogenic variant and/or early onset disease, screening should be performed every 12 years. However, in the absence of these 2 conditions, children and adolescents should be screened every 2-3 years. For adults, screening is recommended every 3-5 years, and at the onset of symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease.2

All myocardial segments should be carefully examined for evidence of hypertrophy. CMR should be considered in patients with technically challenging echocardiograms, and in patients in whom abnormal electrocardiographic ﬁndings are present despite an apparently normal echocardiogram. There are several observational studies in patients who are genotype positive but who have not yet developed LV hypertrophy, noting the presence of crypts, increased ratio of LV wall thickness to LV end-diastolic dimension, increased ECV by CMR, and abnormal segmental systolic and diastolic function.1,211-214 Despite these intriguing ﬁndings, there are few studies relating these abnormalities to the subsequent development of pathological LVH.215
Recommendations and Key Points
1- Echocardiography is the initial imaging modality for HCM screening. 2- Periodic screening is recommended at intervals that depend on age, pres-
ence of a known pathogenic variant, and whether disease is early onset. 3- CMR should be considered in patients with technically challenging
echocardiograms, and in patients in whom abnormal electrocardiographic ﬁndings are present despite an apparently normal echocardiogram.

D. Role of Imaging in Treatment Selection and Monitoring
1. Monitoring Medical therapy. Medical therapy for symptomatic HCM with either the obstructive or nonobstructive phenotype is directed at the relief of symptoms and therefore the primary outcome of treatment is symptom-based. Titration of beta blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is based on clinical response, with monitoring for bradycardia or atrioventricular conduction block.
In patients with obstructive HCM who remain symptomatic despite maximally tolerated dose of a beta blocker and/or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with or without the use of disopyramide, repeat echocardiography to evaluate for the presence of a resting and/or provocable peak instantaneous LVOT gradient of $50 mm Hg is appropriate. If this gradient threshold is identiﬁed, discussion and shared decision-making with the patient regarding SRT is appropriate.
For patients with reduced EF on treatment with guideline-directed medical therapy, repeat echocardiography to evaluate for reverse remodeling and changes in LV ﬁlling and pulmonary artery pressures is reasonable. In the absence of a change in clinical status, repeat TTE every 1 to 2 years is recommended.2
A new class of oral allosteric inhibitors of cardiac b-myosin is emerging. This class of drugs resets the equilibrium between the on and off state of myosin heads, causing reversible inhibition of actinmyosin cross bridging. As a result, when these therapies become clinically available, monitoring of LVEF will be required. The frequency of examinations, and clinically relevant LVEF thresholds, remain to be determined.
2. Pacing. Dual-chamber pacing is not recommended for the majority of patients with HCM for treatment of LVOTO. It may be useful in a select group of patients, speciﬁcally those with a signiﬁcant resting

or provoked LVOT gradient with drug-refractory symptoms who are not candidates for septal reduction therapies.144,216 Pacing may also be necessary in patients who develop high degree conduction system disease with heart block after septal reduction therapies as these interventions can damage the conduction system.
Apical RV lead placement is optimal for patients with obstructive HCM to ensure maximal beneﬁt from RV pacing (reducing LVOT gradient and preserving cardiac output), and TEE guidance can be used.217 In patients who meet criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy-deﬁbrillator (CRT-D), echocardiography is supportive for the evaluation and follow up of response to this intervention, and selection of the most optimal atrioventricular delay.103,218
3. Surgery. TEE imaging is important for intraoperative surgical planning and guidance of septal myectomy. The optimal surgical approach depends on the location and extent of maximum septal thickness, mitral valve pathology, and coexisting lesions, such as valvular aortic stenosis. The preprocedural evaluation should evaluate the interventricular septum, the mitral valve apparatus, and any other factors contributing to LVOT obstruction. Concomitant intrinsic valve disease should be noted.
The interventricular septum is best evaluated in the midesophageal 4-chamber and long-axis views. The location of maximal thickness should be measured in both the anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls at end-diastole. It is important when making these measurements to optimize border deﬁnition of the ventricular walls and be conservative with measurements when the borders are not clearly deﬁned. In addition, the longitudinal extent of thickness needs to be determined. A useful measurement to guide the surgeon’s resection includes the distance from the base of the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve to the contact point of the anterior mitral valve leaﬂet with the septum (Figure 28).

Figure 28 Transesophageal echocardiogram of intra-operative septal measurements. Left panel: Pre-bypass mid-esophageal 4chamber view; longitudinal extent of interventricular septum thickness = 4.0 cm. Right panel: Pre-bypass mid-esophageal longaxis view; interventricular septum maximum thickness is 2.6 cm, distance between coaptation point of anterior leaﬂet mitral valve with septum to right coronary cusp is 2.3 cm.

The mitral valve should be carefully evaluated. MR related to SAM of the mitral valve is typically posteriorly oriented126 and septal myectomy alone is adequate to resolve the MR. However, MR related to intrinsic mitral valve disease has to be addressed separately. The length of the anterior leaﬂet of the mitral valve should be measured, as a leaﬂet >16 mm/m2 is considered elongated, may contribute to obstruction, and may require leaﬂet plication.219,220 In addition, imaging should be performed to determine if anomalous insertion of the papillary muscle is present, as it needs unique treatment, with papillary muscle release and resection of the abnormal attachments to the mitral valve, or papillary muscle realignment.221 Mitral valve replacement should only be performed in patients with intrinsic mitral valve pathology not amenable to repair and its routine use with septal myectomy should be discouraged.
Finally, the LVOT needs to be evaluated to conﬁrm dynamic obstruction and rule out aortic stenosis or a subaortic membrane. Dynamic gradients are best obtained in a deep transgastric view but

may not be as high as on pre-procedural imaging due to limitations of Doppler alignment and the hemodynamic effects of anesthesia.
After weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, postprocedural assessment is important, including for cases with extended myectomy.220 It usually includes a pharmacological challenge (most commonly with isoproterenol or dobutamine) to evaluate for residual obstruction.222 An elevated LVOT velocity (>3 m/s) or the presence of signiﬁcant SAM during provocation may require a return to bypass for additional surgical intervention. Although it is common to obtain measurements of the interventricular septum during this period, the measurements may not be accurate due to tissue edema. Finally, complications related to myectomy, such as aortic regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, and coronary cameral ﬁstula, need to be excluded (Figure 29).
The application of intraoperative TEE in the management of surgical myectomy has been detailed in the ASE Guidelines for the Use of Transesophageal Echocardiography to Assist with Surgical Decision-

4. Alcohol Septal Ablation. Imaging plays an important role in patient selection for alcohol (ethanol) septal ablation, with the goal of determining location of the increased septal thickness, dynamic obstruction, and presence of coexisting abnormalities that can indicate a preference for surgical intervention. These include the need for corrective mitral/papillary surgery as well as for extended myectomy when hypertrophy extends into the middle LV.
Echocardiography is essential for procedural guidance of alcohol septal ablation.223-226 Ethanol is injected into one of the proximal septal perforator branches (which usually arises from the left anterior

descending coronary artery) to produce localized myocardial infarction of the proximal anterior septum thereby reducing dynamic obstruction (Videos 5 to 8). The use of myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) with the injection of echocardiographic contrast agent into the target septal artery (or arteries) to delineate the vascular distribution of the individual perforator branches is important to the success of the procedure. After the target septal perforator is identiﬁed and cannulated, a balloon catheter is advanced into the vessel and inﬂated to prevent backﬂow. Subsequently, 1 to 2 mL of a diluted contrast agent is injected through the balloon catheter followed by a 1-2-mL saline ﬂush during continuous imaging. The contrast agent should be diluted with normal saline to optimize myocardial opaciﬁcation and minimize attenuation. Most operators now use agitated radiographic contrast

instead of UEA. MCE produces a demarcated area with increased echocardiographic density in the basal septum. It is important to document the absence of perfusion of myocardial segments remote from the targeted areas for ablation, including the LV anterolateral wall, RV free wall, and papillary muscles. Observational studies have shown that the use of MCE results in shorter intervention time, ﬂuoroscopy duration, a smaller number of occluded vessels, a smaller volume of injected ethanol, lower likelihood of heart block, and higher likelihood of success. This is due to the selection of different vessels for ethanol injection based on the segments opaciﬁed by MCE, and in some cases aborting the procedure altogether.
At most centers, TTE is used for intraprocedural guidance, relying on apical 4-, 3-, and 2-chamber views and parasternal short-axis and long-axis views to delineate opaciﬁcation of target and nontarget regions (if present). Sometimes, TEE is needed because of challenging TTE images. If TEE is used, the 4-chamber (deep gastric at 0) and longitudinal (mid-esophageal, aortic valve level, 120–130) views should be used. These views may be supplemented by the transgastric shortaxis view to assess for possible perfusion of the papillary muscles or the RV. After the procedure, cardiac imaging (usually only echocardiography is needed) is used to evaluate changes in septal thickness, LV dimensions, mass, systolic and diastolic functions, MR, and possible complications such as ventricular septal defect.227
5. Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair. Although there are no formal guideline recommendations for the use of transcatheter edgeto-edge repair (TEER), in patients who remain symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy and are deemed to have an unacceptable risk for septal reduction therapy, including septal thickness <1.5 cm, an off-label approach of percutaneous mitral plication may be considered.2 Favorable baseline ﬁndings include SAM resulting in LVOTobstruction, absence of calciﬁcation in the grasping zone, and suitable mitral valve area (mean transmitral gradient <5 mm Hg and mitral valve area $4 cm2) to exclude signiﬁcant post-procedure mitral valve stenosis (Figure 30 and Videos 9 to 11).
Recommendations and Key Points
1- For patients on oral allosteric modulators of cardiac b-myosin, monitoring of LVEF is essential to avoid the development of heart failure due to reduced EF.
2- Intraoperative TEE plays a critical role in guiding the management of HCM patients undergoing surgical myectomy.
3- Myocardial contrast echocardiography plays a critical role in intraprocedural guidance of alcohol septal ablation.
4- TEE is critical for intraprocedural guidance of TEER to treat obstructive HCM patients who are not candidates for septal reduction therapy.

with echocardiography and/or CMR is needed for screening. In addition, imaging can guide treatment for obstructive HCM, be it with negative inotropic drugs, septal reduction therapy, or TEER of the mitral valve. The imaging staff should have a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of the different imaging modalities and the clinical implications of the ﬁndings ascertained by imaging. Importantly, the results should be communicated clearly with the clinical team taking care of the patient.

SUMMARY
Multimodality imaging plays a crucial role in the initial evaluation of patients with known or suspected HCM. In conjunction with clinical ﬁndings, imaging can conﬁrm or refute the diagnosis. Imaging should be performed at clinical sites/centers of excellence with experience in the diagnosis and management of HCM. Imaging is central to risk stratiﬁcation for sudden cardiac death as well as the evaluation of patients with chest pain and possible CAD. Along with ECG, imaging
