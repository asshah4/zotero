a b s t r a c t
Background: It is unclear whether there is any difference in the background and prognosis between nonelderly patients who undergo catheter ablation of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) and common atrial ﬂutter (CAFL).
Purpose: To investigate the difference between the patient background of both CAFL and AF in the nonelderly.
Methods: In 526 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of clinical paroxysmal/persistent CAFL or AF in our hospital, we enrolled only patients under 60 years old. Cases harboring both AFL and AF were excluded. We analyzed the patient characteristics, echocardiographic ﬁndings, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during sinus rhythm, and clinical course after ablation.
Results: In total, 196 patients (Cohort 1: 142 males, 156 AF cases) were analyzed. AFL patients were younger than AF patients (47.4 ± 10.6 vs. 50.2 ± 6.4years, p = 0.031) and organic heart disease (OHD) was signiﬁcantly more common in AFL patients than AF patients (42.5% vs. 11.5%, p<0.001). In 161 patients excluding OHD (Cohort 2), ECG abnormalities were more frequent in AFL than in AF patients (78.3% vs. 39.1%, p = 0.001). There were no signiﬁcant differences in all-cause death, onset of heart failure, and cerebral strokes. On the other hand, the number of cases that required a pacemaker was signiﬁcantly higher in the CAFL group than AF group (0.0% vs. 26.1%, p-value <0.001). These results suggested that CAFL may reﬂect occurrence of any atrial myocardial damage, even if it does not lead to heart failure.
Conclusions: Our present study suggested that CAFL may be associated with a broader atrial myocardial disorder in non-elderly patients.

Introduction
Common atrial ﬂutter (CAFL) is an atrial arrhythmia which is often encountered in clinical practice. CAFL is a macro-reentrant tachycardia reciprocating in the right atrium around the tricuspid valve [1]. Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is also a common arrhythmia at the bedside. AF potentially originates from both atria, while pulmonary veins are dominant pathogenic structures [2]. According to some large-scale epidemiological cohorts, those two arrhythmias have not been always clearly distinguished [3-7]. However, in recent years, the differences in the clinical background and progno-

sis between those two arrhythmias have been reported in some studies [8, 9]. Common implications of those studies were that the CAFL-group had an inferior prognosis to the AF-group. On the other hand, both atrial arrhythmias are more prevalent in the elderly, who are likely to have more comorbidities affecting their cardiac function [9]. Therefore, comparative studies in non-elderly subjects may emphasize the fundamental difference between those two arrhythmias. In the present report, we investigated the patient background and clinical course after catheter ablation of AF and CAFL, exclusively in non-elderly people.

Methods
Patient enrolment
A patient enrolment ﬂowchart is shown in Fig. 1. We enrolled patients under 60 years of age who underwent a ﬁrst-time catheter ablation for AF or CAFL in our single center between October 2003 and September 2018. Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed with both CAFL and AF before the index procedure. All patients were to receive all treatments including catheter ablation and anticoagulation based on contemporary guidelines. The patient demographics and background were retrospectively collected, including the electrocardiography (ECG) during sinus rhythm after catheter ablation, transthoracic echocardiography, and the clinical course after the catheter ablation. The present study was carried out analyzing two cohorts. First, all patients were compared between the AF and CAFL groups (Cohort 1). Cohort 1 was analyzed to mainly assess the background of the subjects. Second, among the primary cohort, only the patients who had no known organic heart disease (OHD) were compared for the clinical prognosis (Cohort 2). The analysis of Cohort 2 aimed to reveal the difference in the underlying electrical/anatomical abnormalities between AF and CAFL as well as the prognosis after the procedure. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

ping catheter was inserted through the right femoral vein for pacing and recording within the coronary sinus. As for the treatment of AF, the procedure was performed under conscious sedation obtained with dexmedetomidine. A 100 IU/kg body weight of heparin was administered immediately following the venous access, and heparinized saline was additionally infused to maintain the activated clotting times at 300–400 s. A single transseptal puncture was performed with an 8-Fr long sheath (SL0, AF Division, SJM, Minneapolis, MN, USA). An additional long sheath was inserted into the left atrium through the same puncture. A circular mapping catheter was used for mapping all pulmonary veins before and after the ablation to conﬁrm the electrical isolation. Radiofrequency energy was applied to achieve an enlarged encircling pulmonary vein isolation. Additional ablation including a left atrial roof line, left atrial bottom line, and mitral isthmus line was performed if needed, whereas the isolation of the superior vena cava and ablation targeting ganglionated plexi was rarely performed. All procedures were performed using a three-dimensional mapping system. As for the treatment of CAFL, minimum sedation with pentazocin was used to perform the ablation procedure. Another 10-pole catheter was positioned on the tricuspid annulus. Radiofrequency current was delivered to the cavo-tricuspid isthmus to establish bidirectional electrical block. Basically, no additional ablation was performed.

Ablation procedure

Follow-up

All antiarrhythmic drugs were basically discontinued for at least ﬁve half-lives prior to the procedure. The surface electrocardiogram and bipolar intracardiac electrograms were continuously monitored and stored on a computer-based digital recording system (RMS4000/RMS-5000, NIHON KODEN, Tokyo, Japan). The bipolar electrograms were ﬁltered from 30 to 500 Hz. A 5Fr 10-pole map-

All patients were followed-up at our institution or nearby clinic. If adequate data for the present analysis were lacking, it was complemented by individual interviews over the telephone. The primary endpoint was deﬁned as the composite of all death, onset of heart failure, and cerebral strokes. The secondary endpoint was deﬁned as additional catheter ablation or a pacemaker implantation.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1 software (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) [10]. Continuous variables were reported as the mean ± SD and were compared using the Student t-test. Differences between proportions were compared using Fisher’s exact tests. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to express the percentage of patients free from events after the index procedure and any differences were analyzed with a log-rank test. All p-values were 2-sided, and statistical signiﬁcance was established at a p < 0.05.

Results
Patient characteristics (Cohort 1)
We ﬁnally enrolled 196 patients consisting of 156 cases with AF and 40 with CAFL. All ablation procedures were successful, while no fatal complications were observed related to the procedures. The background of the patients is shown in Table 1. As compared to the AF group, the age was signiﬁcantly younger in the CAFL group (50.2 ± 6.4 years vs. 47.4 ± 10.6 years, p = 0.03), and OHD (e.g. any cardiomyopathy and history of surgical operation) was signiﬁcantly more frequent in the CAFL group (11.5% vs 42.5%, p<0.001). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the number of persistent cases, of which the atrial arrhythmias continued for ≥7 days. There were signiﬁcantly more patients taking antiarrhythmic drugs in the AF group than CAFL group (65.4% vs. 12.5%, p<0.001).

Electrocardiographic ﬁndings (Cohort 1)
The ECG abnormalities were classiﬁed into three components including the atria, conduction system, and ventricles. Overall, ECG abnormalities were more frequently observed in the CAFL group than AF group (40.4% vs. 70.0%, p = 0.001). The classiﬁed comparisons are described in Table 3.
Patient characteristics (Cohort 2)
As a result of the exclusion of patients with OHD, Cohort 2 included 161 patients consisting of 138 cases with AF and 23 with CAFL. Even in those subjects, the age was still signiﬁcantly younger in the CAFL group (50.0 ± 6.5 years vs. 45.6 ± 12.2 years, p = 0.01). The use of antiarrhythmic drugs was more frequent in the AF group (66.7% vs. 8.7%, p<0.001) (Table 1).
Echocardiographic ﬁndings (Cohort 2)
In Cohort 2, only the LVEF was signiﬁcantly lower in the CAFL group (62.2 ± 6.8% vs. 56.9 ± 8.8%, p = 0.004). The LVDdi and the degree of regurgitations did not signiﬁcantly differ (Table 2).
Electrocardiographic ﬁndings (Cohort 2)

Echocardiographic ﬁndings (Cohort 1)
In the CAFL group of Cohort 1, a larger left ventricular end-diastolic diameter index (LVDdi) (26.7 ± 3.7 mm vs. 29.4 ± 5.0 mm, p = 0.002) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (61.0 ± 8.1% vs. 53.6 ± 14.8%, p<0.001) was observed. Aortic valve regurgitation, pulmonary valve regurgitation, and tricuspid valve regurgitation of an American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) grade ≥2 was more frequent in the CAFL group (13.4% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.008, 2.1% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.02, 16.7% vs. 37.5%, p = 0.008) (Table 2).

In Cohort 2, cases exhibiting negative T waves were signiﬁcantly more frequent in the CAFL group, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in the cases that OHD was excluded (18.8% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.099). On the other hand, ECG abnormalities of the atrial system and conduction system were still signiﬁcantly higher in the CAFL group (Table 3).
Clinical prognosis (Cohort 2)
The average follow-up period from the catheter ablation in the cases without OHD was signiﬁcantly longer in the CAFL group, but

both groups had an average follow-up period of more than four years (53.7 ± 34.9 months vs. 86.9 ± 52.3 months, p<0.001). There were no signiﬁcant differences in the primary endpoints between the two groups. As for the secondary endpoints, those who required a pacemaker for bradycardia were signiﬁcantly more prevalent in the CAFL group than AF group (26.1% vs. 0.0%, p<0.001) (Table 4). A Kaplan-Meier curve is shown in Fig. 2. The average period until the implantation of a pacemaker from the index ablation was 22.3 months, and the causative diseases were 4 with sick sinus syndrome and 2 with atrioventricular block.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report to evaluate the clinical difference in non-elderly patients who underwent catheter ablation of AF and CAFL. Our results showed that OHD was signiﬁcantly more frequent in the CAFL group among the whole cohort. However, even in cases in which OHD was excluded, ECG abnormalities and the need for a pacemaker were still more common in the CAFL group than AF group.
CAFL has often been combined with AF in major epidemiological studies [3-7]. The sub-analysis of the Framingham study inves-

tigating the risk of developing AF did not distinguish CAFL from AF [7]. However, they should be classiﬁed as needing to be discussed because the underlying mechanisms are different. In recent years, studies clearly distinguishing CAFL from AF have been published, suggesting that the prognosis of CAFL is worse than that of AF [8, 9]. According to a sub-analysis of the Framingham study that investigated ECGs and the natural prognosis by separating CAFL cases from AF cases in all generations, the all-cause mortality in the CAFL group was higher than that in the control group [9]. The ECG ﬁndings in the study showed that the PR interval in the CAFL cases was signiﬁcantly longer than in the AF cases. In a study comparing the prognosis of 2004 CAFL cases and 3803 AF cases after catheter ablation registered in the Danish National Health Registry, all-cause death, heart failure, and implantation of a pacemaker were more common in the CAFL group [8]. These two studies did not stratify the patients, and included the elderly and patients with a history of OHD, which potentially affected the prognosis. It is known that the prevalence of CAFL as well as AF increases with age [9]. The degeneration of the atrial myocardium with the aging process predisposes the patients to a new onset of atrial arrhythmias, while comorbities affecting the cardiovascular function may also increase the chance of myocardial damage. In contrast, patients under 60 years are expected to have less degeneration of the heart tissue and to reﬂect a more fundamental difference between those two arrhythmias.
In Cohort 1 in the present study, CAFL was signiﬁcantly related to OHD as in the previous reports. In Cohort 2, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint including all-cause death, onset of heart failure, and strokes, presumably because those endpoints were less likely in young patients without OHD. However, a signiﬁcant difference was observed for the ECG abnormalities and incidence of a pacemaker implantation. Those ﬁndings may be explained by the observation that macroreentrant CAFL requires the presence of an adequate excitable gap to be maintained, while partial slowing of the conduction velocity in the human right atrium has already been reported [1]. The decrease in the conduction ve-

locity in CAFL cases may reﬂect latent atrial cardiomyopathy and potentially predict future development of cardiac diseases. In contrast, AF can be perpetuated only by high frequency electrical activity in a smaller portion of the atrial tissue such as the pulmonary veins, without signiﬁcant decrease of the conduction velocity [2, 11]. Overall, in clinical practice, even young patients after catheter ablation of CAFL should be carefully followed-up. Moreover, as the analysis of the Danish nationwide health databases, mentioned above, reported that the highest risk factor for the onset of heart failure was the need for a pacemaker, physicians should be on the alert especially in patients with bradycardiac abnormalities [8].
Limitations
We assumed there were some limitations regarding the present study. First, this was a small-numbered, retrospective single-center study. Second, the selection of patients may have been biased because the present study was performed only in those who underwent catheter ablation. Third, the follow-up period was shorter than the prior studies from large registries. Further investigation with large-sized cohorts should be performed to validate the present results.
Conclusion
CAFL may be more closely associated with myocardial damage than AF even in non-elderly patients.
