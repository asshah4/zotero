Since its ﬁrst description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial ﬂutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved. One AFL circuit can

have variable electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations depending on the presence of pre-existing atrial lesions, or impaired atrial substrate.

Conversely, different (right sided or even left sided) atrial circuits including different mechanisms (macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal)

can present with a very similar surface ECG manifestation. The development of efﬁcient high-resolution electroanatomical mapping systems

has improved our knowledge about AFL mechanisms, as well as facilitated their curative treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation.

This article will review ECG features for typical and atypical ﬂutters, and emphasize the limitations for circuit location from the surface ECG.

Introduction
Since its ﬁrst description a century ago, our understanding of atrial ﬂutter (AFL) has evolved, from a relatively simple and unique electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern corresponding to a right atrial macroreentry, to a variety of atrial tachycardias (ATs) originating from the right atrium as well as the left atrium, and resulting from different mechanisms. The use of multielectrodes catheters and the recent development of sophisticated computerized electroanatomical mapping with virtual anatomical chambers reconstruction and fusion with the actual anatomical radiological image has improved our knowledge of AFL circuits and foci location. These technological improvements have also facilitated curative treatment with radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation while simultaneously creating some terminological and conceptual confusion about its nature.
Historical review and clinical perspectives
The term ﬂutter ﬁrst appeared a century ago in 1887, with Mac William who described the visual phenomena resulting from ‘faradic stimulation of the auricles which sets them into a rapid ﬂutter’.1 It was only 23 years later that Jolly and Ritchie, using the Cambridge model of Einthoven’s string galvanometer recorded the ﬁrst ECG example of AFL.2

A single wave circus movement mechanism was initially proposed by Lewis,3 but the possibility to reproduce the ECG morphology of AFL with high pacing rate or with focal aconitine injection supported a focal mechanism as another possible hypothesis.4,5 Although both mechanisms are easily observed in animal models, the circus movement theory has been ﬁnally accepted as being by far the most frequent in man. A macroreentrant mechanism was ﬁnally proven by detailed mapping in the operating room, as well as in the electrophysiology laboratory.
Clinical perspectives
While detailed epidemiologic studies of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) exist, similar studies of AFL are less frequent. Atrial ﬂutter occurs ,1/10 as often as AF. Studies from the Marshﬁeld Epidemiologic Study Area database have reported that the overall incidence of AFL is
88 per 100 000 person-years. The incidence of AFL in those younger than 50 years is 5/100 000, but rises sharply to 587/100 000 in those .80 years old.6
Atrial ﬂutter coexists with or precedes AF. In a longitudinal study, AF developed in 56% of patients with lone AFL.7 It has also been shown that 25 –82% of the patients who beneﬁted from successful RF ablation for isolated typical AFL will experience new onset of AF during the follow-up.8,9 The close inter-relationship between AF and AFL is complex.10 Some authors have shown that patients with coexistent AF and AFL should beneﬁt from RF catheter ablation of AF, eventually associated with AFL ablation instead of AFL ablation

only.11 It is accepted that patients presenting with AFL must beneﬁt from the same anti-thrombotic prophylaxis as for AF, according to the presence of a signiﬁcant thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score). The periablation period for AFL should include the same cautions as for elective cardioversion for AF.
Classiﬁcations of atrial ﬂutters
In 1970 Puech and Grolleau proposed a classiﬁcation of AFL according to the ECG morphology.12 The most frequent form of ﬂutter was named ‘common’ if predominantly negative biphasic ﬂutter waves were seen in inferior leads with a sawtooth pattern, which preceded the positivity in V1; AFL was termed ‘atypical’ or ‘rare’ if the ECG morphology was different from the common type.12
Another popular and more recent classiﬁcation was based on baseline atrial rate, stable intracardiac electrograms rate and morphology, and the ability to transiently entrain the tachycardia based on published criteria.13
In 2001, an international group of experts proposed the following deﬁnition of ATs and AFLs14: Atrial tachycardias are regular atrial rhythms at a constant rate ≥100 beats/min originating outside the sinus node region. They can be focal or macroreentrant.
Atrial ﬂutter is the ECG aspect of a regular AT with a rate ≥ 240 beats/min lacking an isoelectric baseline between deﬂections. Importantly, all agreed on the fact that neither rate nor lack of

isoelectric baseline was speciﬁc for the tachycardia mechanism. Atrial ﬂutter is termed typical [cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)dependent] if the inferior pivot point is the area bounded anteriorly by the inferior part of the tricuspid oriﬁce, and posteriorly by the inferior vena cava oriﬁce and its continuation in the Eustachian ridge (Figure 1A).
Although this classiﬁcation clearly limited the use of the term ﬂutter to the sole continuous undulating ECG pattern, in daily clinical practice the word ﬂutter is frequently used to describe any type of fast AT independently of the ECG presentation. This confusing use of the term ﬂutter is probably due to the fact that, for practical and ablative reasons, the ﬁnal arrhythmia diagnosis is based solely on intracardiac electrogram and result of ablation.15,16
This article will review ECG features of typical ﬂutters and of various ATs with a ﬂutter pattern, which will be termed for this discussion as atypical.
Typical atrial ﬂutters
Counterclockwise typical ﬂutter
Still frequently referred to as common or type I ﬂutter, this is the most frequent type of AFL. It is a remarkable arrhythmia in that it is very similar in morphology between from patient to patient, and has a constant cycle length with almost no variation between cycles. Its mechanism is macroreentry conﬁned in the right atrium, with typically a

descending wavefront in the lateral wall and ascendant on the septum with passive activation of the left atrium (Figure 1B and C ). The circuit is bounded anteriorly by the tricuspid valve and posteriorly by a combination of anatomic obstacles (oriﬁces of superior vena cava superiorly, inferior vena cava inferiorly and Eustachian ridge posteriorly) and anatomo-functional barriers (region of the crista terminalis or of the sinus venosus).17 – 19 As the atrioventricular transmission is almost always 2 : 1, manoeuvres to increase the degree of atrioventricular block such as carotid massage may be required. The characteristic ‘sawtooth’ pattern is seen in the inferior leads, which is due to an initial gradual downsloping plateau segment followed by a sharp steep descent, and then by a sharp ascent with a low amplitude terminal positive component, which continues into the subsequent plateau. In the precordial leads, lead V1 shows an initial isoelectric line followed by a positive component which falls always later than the negative component of the inferior leads. This produces an ‘overall impression of an upright ﬂutter wave in V1’.20 Lead I is low amplitude/isoelectric and aVL usually upright.
This classic appearance may occasionally show morphologic variations, and has led to a classiﬁcation into three types of ECG patterns for counterclockwise (CCW) CTI-dependent ﬂutters based on the presence and type of the initial positive deﬂection.21 A terminal positive component of the F-wave in typical CCW ﬂutter seems to identify a patient population with a relatively high likelihood of heart disease, higher incidence of AF and left atrial enlargement. It should be stressed that severe right atrial disease/conduction disturbances

may yield strange ECG patterns and the typical circuit may then be difﬁcult to diagnose (Figure 2).
Counterclockwise lower loop reentry
At times typical AFL may become irregular and/or faster and this led Cheng in 1999 to describe what we consider as a variant of typical ﬂutter: lower loop reentry.22 The circuit is localized in the lower right atrium, but is also CTI dependent. The circuit involves the lower right atrium, as manifested by (i) an early breakthrough in the lower right atrium, (ii) wavefront collision in the high lateral right atrium or septum and (iii) conduction through the CTI. Alternating lower loop reentry and typical AFL or variable breakthrough sites in the lateral right atrium may result in cycle length oscillation. Of note, the left atrium and the septum are activated in a similar sequence to CCW typical AFL, giving negative atrial complexes in the inferior leads. The morphology of the ﬂutter wave is determined by the site of the breakthrough of the wavefront at the crista terminalis. If the breakthrough occurs at the low lateral right atrium, the resulting clockwise (CW) ascending wavefront will collide with the CCW wavefront propagating from the inter-atrial septum and right atrial roof, thus abolishing the late descending wavefront seen in typical CCW AFL on the lateral RA wall. Then, the late positive deﬂection seen on the ﬂutter wave in the inferior leads during CCW typical AFL will be attenuated during lower loop reentry circuit, by abolition of these late inferiorly directed forces.23 The exact aetiology of the different ECG patterns is incompletely known

Even despite the limitation of interpretation because of the 2 : 1 AV transmission, it can be seen that the aspect does not suggest the mechanism of tachycardia. This is due to the altered right atrial impulse propagation as seen during sinus rhythm after successful cavotricuspid ablation. Precordial leads are magniﬁed for this ﬁgure.

(between CCW and CW AFL). The presence of an atrial myopathy, and/or scarred atrium may markedly inﬂuence ECG morphology.
Double-wave reentry
Another type of acceleration of typical ﬂutter with the same ECG morphology can be induced by pacing in the electrophysiological laboratory. This is caused by two successive activation wavefronts circulating in the same direction along the same reentrant circuit (double-wave reentry). All of the double-wave reentry episodes in the initial report were transient and blocked in the CTI. The clinical signiﬁcance of this rarely observed phenomenon is unknown.24
Partial cavotricuspid isthmus (sub-Eustachian) short circuit
Counterclockwise AFL may be spontaneously associated with premature activation of the coronary sinus (CS) ostium and impulse collision at the isthmus of both the orthodromic CCW wavefront and another front emerging from the CS ostial region. This has also been observed with a sudden and sustained cycle length prolongation or after previous RF pulse delivery in the anterior portion (sub Eustachian) of the CTI.25 This may be due to a partial conduction within the Eustachian ridge allowing short circuiting the circuit posterior to the CS ostium,26,27 or to the presence of a pectineate muscle band from the crista effectively separating the isthmus into anterior and posterior compartments.28
Dual loop reentry during typical ﬂutter
Typical AFL with a CCW loop around the tricuspid valve but sharing a common anterior channel with a CW loop around a lateral atriotomy scar are often seen after post-atrial septal defect surgical closure.29 Radiofrequency delivery in the CTI transforms the tachycardia without any pause to a different morphology tachycardia with different axis and morphology but nearly the same cycle length owing to rotation around the periatriotomy loop alone. This arrhythmia typically requires ablation of a second isthmus: between one end of the atriotomy and a natural obstacle.
Clockwise typical ﬂutter
In 10 –30% of typical AFLs, the reentrant circuit and the anatomical/functional constraints are identical within the right atrium, but rotates in a CW direction around the tricuspid valve in a left anterior oblique perspective.30 A high percentage of these AFLs may be induced in the electrophysiology laboratory or occur after ablation of CCW typical ﬂutter.31 In our initial series, the classic ‘sawtooth’ pattern was observed in 14 of 18 CW ﬂutters. Although frequently referred to as ‘positive ﬂutter wave in the inferior leads’, we found that a shorter plateau phase, a widening of the negative component of the F-wave (both possibly suggesting an inconstant impression of positivity) and a negative and frequently biﬁd F-wave in V1 were its most consistent ﬁndings. A positive F-wave in V6 follows after the negative one in V1 (Figure 3).
Clockwise lower loop reentry
In one study of 12 patients with positive ﬂutter waves in the inferior leads suggesting CW typical AFL, it was found with entrainment pacing that the reentrant circuit involved was the lower right

atrium around the inferior vena cava in 7 patients, a ﬁgure-of-8 double-loop reentry around both the inferior vena cava and tricuspid annulus in 4, and a single reentrant loop around the tricuspid annulus in 1.32
Catheter ablation of typical atrial ﬂutter
After the initial attempts at direct current fulguration,33 typical ﬂutters are amenable to RF catheter ablation with high success rate independently of the direction of the rotation or circuit shortcuts, with the same endpoints.34 – 36 Careful conﬁrmation of CTI dependency of the circuit is always the ﬁrst step of the procedure, using entrainment-guided-mapping techniques. This is especially critical when ECG presentation is not typical as may be the case in postoperative or post-atrial ablation patients, in the presence of severe intra-atrial conduction disturbances, antiarrhythmic drugs or congenital heart disease. In these cases, conﬁrmation of CTI-dependency is mandatory, although it may sometimes be difﬁcult or even misleading.37 A continuous line of ablation across the CTI has become the standard therapeutic approach. The endpoints of RF catheter ablation are now standardized: besides ﬂutter termination and creation of a complete line of block (double potentials), the persistent CTI bidirectional block should be assessed by pacing techniques. More recently, some authors have proposed an ablation technique targeting preferentially high-voltage electrograms within the CTI, corresponding anatomically to muscle bundles.38
This therapeutic approach is now proposed as a ﬁrst-line therapy with high success rate, rare complications and uncommon late recurrences in experienced hands. 39 – 42
Intra-isthmus reentry
This is a recently described entity which may be included in the group of typical AFLs.43 The surface ECGs show typical CCW pattern in most patients. Analysis of the tricuspid annulus electrograms may show spontaneous shifts from a CCW to CW or fusion patterns during ongoing ﬂutter. Fractionated potentials spanning over 34– 71% of the tachycardia cycle length are always recorded within the CTI, whereas double potentials are also often seen. Successful ablation always occurs at the area with highly fractionated potentials. Intra-isthmus reentries were mostly found in patients with a redo procedure after previous CTI ablation. Although still debated, the circuit seems conﬁned within the CTI itself, and bounded by the medial CTI and the CS ostium. If the term typical is to be applied to reentrant circuits that are strictly dependent on the CTI, then this is not really the case in the Yang’s series of intra-isthmus reentry, as part of the CTI is frequently out of the circuit and such a ﬂutter can even occur in case of proven complete bidirectional CTI block.44 Careful entrainment mapping just outside the CS ostium can facilitate the diagnosis of this unusual variant (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).45
Atypical atrial ﬂutters: right atrium
Upper loop reentry
A non-CTI-dependent reentrant circuit involving the upper portion of the RA has been termed upper loop reentry tachycardia. Its circuit has been incompletely characterized. The rotation can be CW or CCW but always crosses the upper portion of the crista terminalis

It is difﬁcult to describe the F waves as positive or negative in the frontal plane, but the negative biﬁdity in V1 is highly suggestive of typical clockwise right atrial rotation.

where ablation is successful in eliminating the circuit.46 This circuit is non-CTI dependent, and will typically have a shorter cycle length, but frequently presents with ﬂutter wave morphologies similar to CW typical AFL in the inferior leads. In one study the presence of negative, isoelectric/ﬂat ﬂutter or extremely low positive amplitude (,0.07 mV) wave in lead I was suggestive of upper loop reentry (regardless of the rotation), whereas CW ﬂutter F-wave was constantly positive in lead I.47
Non-scar-related right free wall atrial ﬂutter
In 2000, a small series of non-CTI-dependent AFLs were identiﬁed in six patients presenting with a typical AFL ECG pattern.48 Most had structural heart disease with biatrial dilation, some had been operated but none had previous right atriotomy (except one for whom the atriotomy scar was not involved in the circuit). The surface ECG was judged identical to that of typical ﬂutter in all but for two patients in whom polarity was positive in the inferior leads during ongoing ﬂutter. A large lateral right atrial circuit was observed for which the participation of the crista terminalis was excluded. Ablation was successful after creation of a line between the inferior part of the circuit and the inferior vena cava.
Scar-related right atrial ﬂutter
In a large number of cases, right atrial macroreentrant ATs present with a ﬂutter-like ECG appearance. The central obstacle(s) of the

circuit may be an atriotomy scar, a septal prosthetic patch, a suture line, or a line of ﬁxed block secondary to prior RF catheter ablation. Other obstacles may include anatomic structures located in the vicinity of the scar (superior vena cava, inferior vena cava).
The ECG aspect of scar-related right AFL is highly variable; it depends on anatomic location, direction of the rotation, the presence antiarrhythmic drugs or of coexisting conduction disturbances in the atrium, the existence of a simultaneous peritricuspid circuit and the presence of pre-existing CTI block. Depending on the predominant direction of septal activation, right atrial free wall ﬂutter can mimic either CW or CCW ﬂutter morphology. A negative F-wave in lead V1 will almost certainly identify the right atrial origin of the arrhythmia.
The best characterized atriotomy macroreentrant AT is due to activation around a surgical incision scar in the lateral right atrial wall, with the incision having a supero-inferior axis. Low-voltage electrograms characteristic of areas of scar can be observed during both sinus rhythm and AFL. A line of double potentials is recorded in the lateral right atrium, extending vertically (supero-inferior), corresponding to the atriotomy scar. They are large in the middle of the incision scar and tend to be narrow as the catheter approaches the scar end only to fuse at its superior and inferior ends. Linear RF lesion extending from the inferior portion of the scar (where double potentials fuse) to the inferior vena cava will disrupt the circuit and eliminate the tachycardia. Typical AFL can be associated with right atriotomy tachycardia sequentially or simultaneously

(dual loop reentry). Ablation of one circuit will unmask the other. Ablation of both circuits is necessary for clinical control of recurrent atrial arrhythmias.
Atypical atrial ﬂutters: native left atrium
Atrial ﬂutter in native left atrium is less frequent than in the right atrium. They are commonly associated with signiﬁcant left heart disease including mitral valve disease, hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, or heart failure, but in few cases they may be observed even in the absence of detectable left ventricular heart disease. Sinus rhythm mapping studies have revealed zones of slowed conduction and electrically silent areas, which serve as the appropriate substrate for macroreentry.49
The ECG of left AFL is particularly difﬁcult to characterize, as it may be similar for various circuit locations. The ﬂutter wave usually shows a prominent positive deﬂection in lead V1 and uncommonly is ﬂat or isoelectric but we have seen that this aspect cannot be speciﬁc as it is also encountered in CCW typical ﬂutter. In a minority of patients, the morphology even resembles typical ﬂutter. Yet a broad upright ﬂutter wave in V1 with upright waves in inferior leads or with low amplitude or isoelectric waves in the other leads is suggestive of a left atrial origin (Figure 4).
Left atrial anterior wall macroreentry
In a small series of six patients without previous surgery or ablation, a ﬁgure-of-eight circuit with loops around the mitral annulus (MA) and

a low-voltage (scar) area within the left atrial anterior wall was responsible for a tachycardia with a ﬂutter aspect in the inferior leads in ﬁve cases. The F-wave was broad-based upright or +V1.50 This form may be considered as a sub-type of perimitral ﬂutter (see below).
Coronary sinus atrial ﬂutter
Olgin et al. reported the case of a patient without structural heart disease with a surface ECG of typical ﬂutter, but in whom the circuit included the ostium of the CS, as demonstrated with entrainment mapping.51 Activation-mapping revealed double potentials inside the CS. The circuit involved the CS myocardium, exiting in the lateral left atrium, went downwards the inter-atrial septum, and reentered into the CS. The arrhythmia was cured by delivering RF energy within the CS.
Atypical atrial ﬂutters: post-intervention left atrium
The existence of a pre-existing structural heart disease, the development of cardiac surgery at times involving speciﬁcally the atrial myocardium and ﬁnally the widespread use of RF catheter ablation for AF has led to the emergence of a very large number of regular ATs frequently presenting as AFLs. The most common examples are encountered after pulmonary vein isolation, but especially after extensive atrial ablation including linear lesions and/or defragmentation. Those circuits can have an AFL ECG manifestation, sometimes mimicking a CTI-dependent ﬂutter; they can involve different propagation

Figure 4 Atrial ﬂutter in a 27-year-old male patient with previous ablation of a postero-septal accessory pathway. The surface electrocardiographic pattern in the inferior leads suggests a typical counterclockwise ﬂutter, but three-dimensional electroanatomical activation map (here in postero-anterior projection) revealed a microreentry (red star) from the left inferior atrium with ascending propagation in the posterior wall (red arrows).

types (macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal) (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
Many of these tachycardias occurring after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation are reentrant, and related to gaps in prior ablation lines. Perimitral, roof-dependent (Figure 5), and septal circuits are the most frequent mechanism of left atrial macroreentrant ATs.52,53 Recently, even biatrial circuits have been reported.54 Prior atrial lesions make any attempt of location of the site/chamber of origin based on ﬂutter wave morphology very hazardous. Indeed, the signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of intra- and inter-atrial propagation after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (and even more after more extensive lesions) is almost always accompanied by a ﬂutter wave distortion that is also encountered during sinus rhythm. In other cases, the ﬂutter wave is modiﬁed during tachycardia because of intra-atrial delay due to RF-induced lesions, but the p wave during sinus rhythm is not necessarily modiﬁed (Supplementary material online, Figure S3). Despite these limitations two types have been relatively characterized on the ECG.
Left septal atrial ﬂutter
A single report of an 11-patient series revealed that the F-wave in V1 was predominantly positive in case of CCW rotation, and negative in case of CW rotation, whereas the limb leads most of the time reveal very low voltage or ﬂat F-wave morphology. The ﬂutter circuit was found to rotate around the left septum primum with a critical isthmus located between the pulmonary veins (PVs) posteriorly and/or mitral valve anteriorly and the septum primum.55

Perimitral atrial ﬂutter
The perimitral ﬂutter is a macroreentrant circuit rotating around the mitral annulus and low-voltage areas or left atrial scars in the atrial wall. In a study of 39 tachycardias in 31 patients, Gerstenfeld et al. described the ECG characteristics of perimitral ﬂutters.56 The polarity in each lead was determined by examining the F-wave during the 80 ms before the tallest peak positive deﬂection in V1. Counterclockwise perimitral ﬂutter was positive in the inferior and precordial leads and had a signiﬁcant negative component in leads I and aVL. Clockwise perimitral ﬂutter demonstrated the converse limb lead morphology with a signiﬁcant negative F-wave in the inferior leads and positive F-wave in leads I and aVL. A proximal to distal CS activation was best at differentiating CCW perimitral ﬂutter from left pulmonary veins ATs, while a distal to proximal CS activation was best at differentiating CW perimitral ﬂutter from CCW typical right AFL. The electrophysiologic diagnosis of perimitral ﬂutter is relatively easy with entrainment pacing techniques using a single CS multipolar catheter when the post-pacing interval is ,30 ms in the proximal as well as the distal CS, and more recently with the demonstration of intracardiac fusion when pacing downstream and recording late antegrade activation from the upstream poles of the same catheter.57 This arrhythmia is particularly difﬁcult to treat as bidirectional mitral isthmus block completion has limited impact on arrhythmia recurrence because it may be challenging to acutely achieve, requiring potentially dangerous epicardial ablation within the CS in up to 60% of cases with signiﬁcant late conduction recovery despite acute block completion58 – 61 More recently, the modiﬁed mitral anterior line has been

shown to be safer and efﬁcient compared with the lateral line, improving the percentage of mitral isthmus block.62
Pulmonary veins-related atrial tachycardia
Atrial tachycardias after RF AF ablation can be due to reentry of variable size using gaps in the line surrounding the pulmonary veins,53 larger macroreentry turning around the superior and the ipsilateral inferior PV or to focal PV discharges. Pulmonary vein-related ATs can sometimes manifest with a ﬂutter ECG aspect in case of associated slow intra-atrial propagation resulting from the previous atrial ablation, as illustrated in Supplementary material online, Figure S3. Some algorithms are useful to differentiate ATs originating from perimitral reentry. A negative component in lead I, when present, can differentiate CCW perimitral ﬂutter from left pulmonary veins ATs.56
Conclusion
Atrial ﬂutter classically refers to the ECG pattern of an undulating wave with no electrical silence in at least one lead of the surface ECG. At the time of frequent catheter ablation, where deep understanding of the arrhythmia mechanism is mandatory, this terminology may be considered as having less interest in that it has limited value for precise anatomic localization of reentrant circuits or site of tachycardia origin. Yet the most representative counterexample is typical CCW AFL for which the ECG predicts a right atrial macroreentrant CTI-dependent ﬂutter with the highest accuracy especially in the absence of structural heart disease or previous ablation. If the other ﬂutter pattern may also suggest a reentrant circuit, this is indeed not speciﬁc as it may result from variable mechanisms (macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal source) in variable localizations (left atrium or right atrium). It is thus fair to say that after its long history, atrial ﬂutter is now, by far, more than just one of a kind.
