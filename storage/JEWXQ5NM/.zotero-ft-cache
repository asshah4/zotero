Abstract Background: We examined the relationships of anger, vital exhaustion, anti-depressant use, and poor social ties with incident atrial fibrillation in a biracial cohort of middle and older-aged adults. Methods: This analysis included 11,445 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study participants who were free of atrial fibrillation at baseline in 1990–1992. Vital exhaustion was assessed at baseline and defined as a score in the highest quartile on the 21-item Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire. Baseline anti-depressant use was self-reported. The Spielberger Trait Anger Scale to assess anger and both the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and the Lubben Social Network Scale to assess social ties were also administered at baseline. The primary outcome was incident atrial fibrillation throughout 2016, identified by electrocardiogram, hospital discharge coding of atrial fibrillation, and death certificates. Results: A total of 2220 incident atrial fibrillation cases were detected over a median follow-up of 23.4 years. After adjusting for age, race-center, sex, education, and height, participants in the 4th Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire quartile (referent ¼ 1st Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire quartile) and those reporting anti-depressant use were at increased risk for atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio ¼ 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.29–1.64 for Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire; hazard ratio ¼ 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.11–1.69 for anti-depressant use). The increased atrial fibrillation risk observed for 4th Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire quartile participants remained significant after additional adjustment for relevant comorbidities (hazard ratio ¼ 1.20; confidence interval 1.06–1.35). No significant associations were observed for anger or poor social ties with development of atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: Vital exhaustion is associated with an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation.

Introduction
Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is the most frequently encountered cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, with an estimated prevalence of up to 17 m people in Europe by 2020.1,2 After accounting for known modiﬁable risk factors, nearly half of the population attributable risk for AF development still remains unexplained.3 Continued investigation into identifying additional risk factors is important to improve our understanding

of the mechanisms that cause AF. Psychological distress has been suggested as one such additional risk factor leading to AF development due to pathways involving the autonomic nervous system (ANS), hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as through direct eﬀects on the sinus and atrioventricular nodes.4–6
Studies in the literature examining the prospective relationship between psychosocial measures and incident AF have reported mixed results. Initial studies, performed in predominantly white populations, reported that depression and chronic stress were not associated with AF while anger, hostility, and tension were, but only in men.7–10 More recently, a nationwide registrybased Danish study found that anti-depressant use was strongly associated with AF development.11 In the MultiEthnic Study of Atherosclerosis, depressive symptoms were also associated with incident AF; however, there were no associations observed for anger, anxiety, or chronic stress.12 Additionally, no studies have evaluated the associations of social support or social isolation with incident AF. We sought to build upon the current literature by examining the association of several psychosocial measures indicative of underlying distress with incident AF in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a well-characterized cohort of predominantly whites and blacks.
Methods
Study population and design
The ARIC study included 15,792 men and women aged 45–64 years sampled from four US communities in 1987–1989.13 Participants were re-examined in 1990– 1992, 1993–1995, 1996–1998, 2011–2013, and 2016– 2017, and were followed for cardiovascular events. Institutional review boards at each participating institution (University of Minnesota, Johns Hopkins University, University of North Carolina, and University of Mississippi Medical Center) approved the study and all participants gave written informed consent at each study visit.
ARIC participants attending Visit 2 (1990–1992) with exposure data on anger, vital exhaustion, antidepressant use, and social support were eligible for this analysis. Visit 2 served as the baseline visit for this analysis. After excluding participants not attending Visit 2 (n ¼ 1444), those with prevalent AF as deﬁned below (n ¼ 245), missing exposure data (n ¼ 51), missing covariate information (n ¼ 2509), those with no followup beyond visit 2 (n ¼ 6), and, due to small numbers, race other than black or white and the few black participants from Minneapolis and Washington County (n ¼ 92), the remaining sample size was 11,445.

The current study is a prospective analysis of these participants to determine the relationships of psychosocial measures, assessed at Visit 2, and incident AF with follow-up through until 31 December 2016.
Psychosocial measures
Anger was measured by the Spielberger Trait Anger scale, which includes 10 items assessing extent and frequency of experiencing anger.14 Each item has a fourpoint response from ‘‘almost never’’ (‘‘1’’) to ‘‘almost always (‘‘4’’) and scores are summed across items to create a Trait Anger score (range, 10–40). High trait anger was deﬁned by scores of 22–40, moderate anger by scores of 15–21, and low anger by scores of 10–14.
Vital exhaustion was assessed via a 21-item Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire (VEQ).15 The questions represented three categories: (a) vegetative depressive symptoms (fatigue, sleep pattern, energy, and concentration); (b) nonvegetative symptoms (crying spells, hopelessness, irritability, decreased libido, and suicidality); and (c) functional depressive symptoms (coping and productivity). Responses are summed to obtain an overall vital exhaustion score, which ranges from 0–42, with higher scores representing more depressive symptoms. The correlation of vital exhaustion and depressive scores measured by the Beck Depression Inventory is 0.62.16 As established cut-oﬀs do not exist, scores were stratiﬁed into approximate quartiles to evaluate potential threshold eﬀects.
Use of anti-depressant medications served as a proxy for participants with mental disorders encompassing the aﬀective and anxiety disorder spectrum. At each study visit, participants brought all medications, vitamins, and supplements taken over the previous two weeks. Trained staﬀ transcribed and coded all medication names. Antidepressant use was coded as a yes/no variable based on current use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other antidepressants.
Social ties were assessed using the short form of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL-SF) and social network was assessed with the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS).17,18 The 16-item ISEL-SF measures an individual’s perception of his or her appraisal support, tangible assets, belonging support, and self-esteem support. Each question of the ISELSF is scored on a four-point rating scale (deﬁnitely true, probably true, probably false, and deﬁnitely false; scored 0–3). The total (summed) score is an aggregate index of social support, with higher scores indicating greater levels of perceived interpersonal support. As established cut-oﬀs for ISEL-SF scores do not exist, scores were stratiﬁed into approximate quartiles to evaluate potential threshold eﬀects.

The LSNS is a self-assessed measure of the size and availability of one’s active social network of family, friends and peers, consisting of 10 questions on a 0–5 rating scale. Total scores range from 0–50 and are classiﬁed based on established levels of risk for social isolation: socially ‘‘isolated’’ ( 20), ‘‘high risk’’ for isolation (21–25), ‘‘moderate risk’’ for isolation (26–30) and ‘‘low risk’’ for isolation (!31). Three groups were created based on scores of 25, 26–30, and !31. The ‘‘isolated’’ and ‘‘high risk’’ categories were collapsed because few participants score within the ‘‘isolated’’ range.
AF
Incident AF was deﬁned as in previous ARIC analyses.19 All electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings automatically coded as AF were visually re-checked by a trained cardiologist to conﬁrm the diagnosis. A trained abstractor obtained and recorded all International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-9CM) hospital discharge diagnoses from each participant’s hospitalizations reported in the annual followup interview. AF was deﬁned as the presence of ICD9-CM code 427.31 or 427.32 in the discharge codes (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-10-CM) codes I48.xx starting in 2015). AF hospitalization diagnoses occurring simultaneously with heart revascularization surgery or other cardiac surgery involving heart valves or septa, without evidence of AF in subsequent hospitalizations or study examinations were excluded. ARIC participants were also labeled as AF cases if the underlying cause of death was AF. The incidence date of AF was deﬁned as the date for the ﬁrst ECG showing AF or the ﬁrst hospital discharge with an AF diagnosis. Individuals with ECG-diagnosed AF at either of the ﬁrst two study visits or those with an AF hospitalization diagnosis prior to Visit 2 were considered to have baseline AF and excluded from this analysis.
Covariates
All covariates were assessed at Visit 2 and included age (years), sex, race, ARIC ﬁeld center, education level (<high school degree, !high school degree; assessed only at visit 1), height, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), cigarette smoking (never/former/current), alcohol consumption (never/former/current), physical activity (PA), medication use (anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood glucose, ECG-deﬁned left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
The modiﬁed Baecke questionnaire was used to assess PA in sport activities during the past year.20 Diabetes was

deﬁned as non-fasting blood glucose !200 mg/dl, eighthour fasting blood glucose !125 mg/dl, self-reported history of physician-diagnosed diabetes, or use of anti-diabetic medications. CVD at baseline included the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), or stroke. CHD was deﬁned as a self-reported history of physician diagnosed myocardial infarction (MI), prior coronary revascularization, a previous MI by electrocardiogram. HF was deﬁned as the reported use of HF medication or the presence of HF according to the Gothenburg criteria.21 Stroke was deﬁned as a selfreported history of physician diagnosed stroke. Prevalent CVD at Visit 2 also considered incident adjudicated events between Visits 1 and 2.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared across VEQ quartiles and according to the development of AF. Categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentage while continuous variables were reported as mean Æ standard deviation.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for incident AF across VEQ score quartiles (referent ¼ 1st quartile) and standard deviation increments as well as anti-depressant use (referent ¼ no anti-depressant use). Follow-up time was deﬁned as the time from Visit 2 to AF development, death, loss to follow-up, or censored at 31 December 2016. Multivariable models were constructed to account for variables known to be associated with AF. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, race-center (whites, Washington County; whites, Minneapolis; blacks, Jackson; blacks, Forsyth County; or whites Forsyth County, education, and height; Model 2 adjusted for Model 1 covariates with the addition of weight, cigarette smoking, diabetes, SBP, DBP, antihypertensive medication use, TC, HDL, physical activity, current alcohol use, CHD, HF, LVH, and stroke. Similar analyses were performed to determine associations for Spielberger Trait Anger score (referent ¼ low), overall and individual component ISEL-SF scores (referent ¼ 1st quartile), and LSNS score (referent ¼ low-risk) with incident AF.
We evaluated for eﬀect modiﬁcation by sex and race, using stratiﬁcation and interaction terms, for analyses involving each of these psychosocial measures and incident AF. Due to the limited sample size, the referent categories were expanded to include the 2nd and 3rd quartiles for the VEQ and ISEL-SF measures and the moderate category for the Spielberger Trait Anger and LSNS measures. Finally, we stratiﬁed participants according to VEQ score (<4th quartile vs 4th quartile) and anti-depressant use (yes vs no) to determine associations with incident AF by joint categories of these

two variables. Statistical signiﬁcance for all comparisons including interactions was deﬁned as p < 0.05. SAS Version 9.4 (Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used for all analyses.
Results
A total of 11,445 participants with baseline data on psychosocial measures and without previous AF were included in the ﬁnal analysis (mean age ¼ 57 Æ 5.7 years; 56% female; 74% white). The mean VEQ score was 10.3 Æ 8.6 and 426 (3.7%) participants reported anti-depressant use at baseline. Two thousand two hundred and twenty (19.4%) participants developed AF (incidence rate per 1000 person-years ¼ 9.8, 95% CI 9.5–10.2; person-years of follow-up ¼ 225,502) over a median follow-up of 23.4 years (25th–75th percentiles ¼ 15.0–25.3 years).
Baseline characteristics are compared according to development of AF (Table 1) and by level of vital exhaustion (Table 2). Female gender, black race, diabetes, cigarette smoking, CVD, LVH, anti-hypertensive and anti-depressant medication use were more common while alcohol consumption was less common among participants with higher VEQ scores. Participants with higher VEQ scores also were less educated, reported less PA, and had a higher BMI, lower height, higher SBP, lower DBP, higher TC, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher serum glucose.
Table 3 shows the risk of incident AF by presence of baseline psychosocial measures. After adjustment for age, sex, race-center, education, weight, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), SBP, DBP, anti-hypertensive medication, TC, HDL, physical activity, alcohol consumption, CHD, congestive HF, LVH, and stroke, higher VEQ scores were associated with an increased risk of AF (HR per SD increment ¼ 1.08; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.03–1.13). Participants with a VEQ score in the 4th quartile had a higher risk of developing AF compared to only those in the 1st quartile (HR ¼ 1.20; 95% CI 1.06–1.35). Results were similar when AF risk for participants with a VEQ score in the 4th quartile were compared to all other participants (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02–1.25).
After adjusting for baseline demographics, participants reporting anti-depressant use also had a higher risk of developing AF compared to those reporting no anti-depressant use (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.11–1.69); however, associations were considerably attenuated in the fully adjusted model (HR 1.21; 95% CI 0.98–1.50). The risk of developing AF did not diﬀer across the various anti-depressant types (Supplemental Material Table 1). No signiﬁcant associations were observed for baseline measures of anger, social support, or social network with development of AF (Table 3). Associations for

VEQ ¼ 4th quartile and anti-depressant use is shown in Table 4. Only participants with VEQ ¼ 4th quartile and without anti-depressant use were at a 13% statistically signiﬁcant higher risk for developing AF (referent ¼ VEQ < 4th quartile þ no anti-depressant). Those using anti-depressant had a non-statistically signiﬁcant 25–27% increased risk of AF.
Discussion
Vital exhaustion was associated with an increased risk of incident AF in a biracial cohort with extended follow-up. This relationship did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer across gender or race. Anti-depressant use showed an association of similar strength with development of AF; however, signiﬁcance was lost with multi-variate adjustment. Anger and poor social ties were not associated with the development of AF in this same cohort.
Prior studies have reported on the prospective relationship of depressive symptoms and AF; however,

none of these studies have speciﬁcally evaluated the relationship between the VEQ and AF.9,11,12 Though multiple prior studies, performed predominantly in individuals with coronary artery disease, demonstrated the VEQ to be highly correlated with other depression screening measures, important diﬀerences between the constructs of vital exhaustion and depressive symptoms exist.16,22,23 The VEQ assesses two symptom dimensions, fatigue and depression, and vital exhaustion itself is deﬁned more broadly as excessive fatigue, feelings of demoralization, and increased irritability.15,23 Guilt and low self-esteem – key features of depression – are largely absent among exhausted persons.24 In a study of healthy individuals who were administered the VEQ, those with ‘‘exhaustion’’ predominantly suﬀered from loss of vigor and excess fatigue, while a depressed mood was almost absent.25 In another study, although the correlation between vital exhaustion score and the Beck Depression Inventory was strong, clear diﬀerences in strength of association between depression, vital exhaustion, and several

other variables were observed.16 Cognitive and mood disturbances characteristic of depression occurred less frequently in the individuals with vital exhaustion whereas loss of energy was signiﬁcantly more often associated with these individuals.
Despite these diﬀerences, however, the increased AF risk associated with higher levels of vital exhaustion observed in this study was consistent with those reported for studies evaluating the relationship between depressive symptoms and incident AF.11,12 In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, depressive symptoms, as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and anti-depressant use were each associated with a 30% increased risk of incident AF.12 In a large nationwide matched Danish cohort registry study spanning nearly 14 years, individuals initiating antidepressant medication were at a substantially higher risk of subsequent AF.11 The risk was greatest in the 30 days before and after medication initiation, as much as 3–8 times higher during this time period compared to a randomly sampled background population without a history of antidepressant treatment. The risk remained increased following this time period but was substantially attenuated (37% and 11% higher in the 2–6 months and 6–12 months after antidepressant therapy initiation, respectively). This observed excess risk noted around the time of anti-depressant initiation may have been confounded by an improved recognition of prevalent AF identiﬁed in connection with the diagnosis of depression, either due to the intensiﬁcation of AF symptoms or increased ECG screening prior to medication initiation.
In contrast to the two studies mentioned above, we found a weaker association of anti-depressant use with incident AF. The risk associated with anti-depressant use may reﬂect the presence of more severe depressive symptoms and not necessarily a lack of eﬀectiveness of these agents. Antidepressant use, however, is indicated for a variety of conditions including both anxiety and aﬀective disorders. Reported associations, therefore, more likely reﬂect a variety of underlying mental health conditions and not simply depressive symptoms. Additionally, there are many reports documenting the pro-arrhythmic eﬀects of anti-depressants. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants have been associated with QT interval prolongation and a small but signiﬁcant increased risk of sudden cardiac death.24,26,27 While nearly all studies are focused on risks of ventricular arrhythmias, a very small study actually found that paroxetine reduces drug-resistant paroxysmal AF, potentially through its ability to modulate vagal tone.28 Further study is still clearly needed to better understand the risk of AF associated with anti-depressant use.
Potential mechanisms linking vital exhaustion to the development of AF are similar to those for depression.

Vital exhaustion is associated with an increased inﬂammatory response.29,30 There is also evidence that vital exhaustion is associated with a decrease in activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, which is important in regulating the body’s stress response.31,32
While some other psychosocial measures in this study were also associated with incident AF in bivariate analyses, the signiﬁcance was lost after multivariate adjustment. Although it is unclear why vital exhaustion was associated with incident AF while anger and two distinct measures of social ties had no association, the ﬁndings are consistent with the previous literature.8–10,12 Poor social support results in increased stress levels and, subsequently, increases the risk of unhealthy behaviors or adverse physiological conditions.33–35 Both anger and stress have also been suggested to elicit AF through similar mechanisms, including activation of the ANS and hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis as well as inducing direct electrophysiological changes in the heart.36,37 While no prior studies have speciﬁcally looked at the risk of AF associated with poor social support or reduced social networks, multiple prospective studies found no association between baseline stress levels and incident AF.9,10,12 In two prior studies, anger was associated with an increased AF risk in one study, but this was only observed in men.8,12
Our study has limitations. We had available only a single measure of psychosocial factors and this analysis does not account for ﬂuctuations in these factors over time. Additionally, we cannot assess the impact of temporal relationships between the diﬀerent psychosocial measures on AF risk. As mentioned above, the VEQ was not speciﬁcally developed to measure depressive symptoms and a commonly recognized cut-point for the presence of depressive symptoms based on this measure does not exist. The method of AF detection requiring either hospitalization or being present on routine ECG is not sensitive for cases of paroxysmal AF that were either asymptomatic or did not require hospitalization, and these cases were missed. Since no information regarding symptom presence or the paroxysmal vs permanent nature of AF is available, we cannot determine whether depression may have stronger associations with certain AF subtypes.
In conclusion, vital exhaustion was associated with an increased risk of incident AF. Considering the overall prevalence of depressive disorders in European nations is estimated at 8.5%, establishing whether vital exhaustion or anti-depressant use increase AF risk, even if only modestly, could have signiﬁcant implications.38 The eﬀect size for the observed association between vital exhaustion and AF in this study was small and clinical relevance cannot be assumed. Further study in larger cohorts with more comprehensive and clinically validated assessments of depression is needed. Ultimately, determining whether targeted eﬀorts to improve the

identiﬁcation and treatment of these individuals actually reduces AF incidence and obtaining a better understanding of how these therapeutic interventions might modify risk will be most important.
