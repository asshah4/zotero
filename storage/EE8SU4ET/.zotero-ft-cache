Even, Focus, and Normal Stress 
 
    D. Robert Ladd 
 
Abstract 
 
The two traditional schools of thought about sentence-accent placement - the ‘Nuclear Stress Rule approach’ and the ‘semantic highlighting approach’ - do not really offer competing accounts of the same phenomenon, but emphasize different aspects of the overall problem. A good starting point for integrating these two approaches is provided by recent work by Gussenhoven. His work makes crucial use of the notion that the focus of a sentence may extend over several constituents and may be divided up into one or more accent bearing domains, within which accent placement is structurally specified. By extending this notion beyond Gussenhoven's original use of it, we arrive at a fundamental distinction between ‘information chunking’ (which depends on ‘given/new’, semantic weight. etc.) and focus (which is a syntactic phenomenon). These represent two separate (though interrelated) functions of accent, and have distinguishable effects on where accents are located. Past descriptions emphasize one or the other of these functions, and can be reconciled with each other if the distinction between the two functions is recognized.
