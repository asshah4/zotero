ABSTRACT Objective Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is evident in only half of patients referred for diagnostic angiography. Five-minute heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive marker for autonomic control of the vasculature, which this study hypothesised could risk-stratify cardiac patients and reduce unnecessary angiograms. Design A prospective observational study (the Alternative Risk Markers in Coronary Artery Disease (ARMeCAD) study). Setting Three cardiac centres in Melbourne, Australia. Patients 470 consecutive patients undergoing elective angiography (with predominantly normal cardiac rhythm), regardless of co-morbidity. Main outcome measures The presence of obstructive CAD ($50% stenosis) on angiography. Results Patients with obstructive CAD had signiﬁcantly reduced HRV, particularly in the low frequency (LF) range (median 180 vs 267 ms2 without CAD; p<0.001). There was a linear trend with the severity of CAD; median LF power (IQR) in patients with normal coronaries was 275 (612), with minor coronary irregularities 255 (400), single-vessel CAD 212 (396) and more severe disease 170 (327) ms2; p value for trend 0.003. There was a similar reduction in LF power regardless of the anatomical location of coronary stenoses. Comparing patients with LF less than 250 and 250 ms2 or greater, the adjusted OR for obstructive CAD using multivariate regression was 2.42, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.38 (p¼0.004). No interactions were noted in subgroup analysis and HRV added to risk prediction irrespective of the baseline Framingham risk (p<0.0001). Conclusion Low HRV is strongly predictive of angiographic coronary disease regardless of other co-morbidities and is clinically useful as a risk predictor in patients with sinus rhythm.

Coronary angiography remains the gold standard method for deﬁning the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in symptomatic patients. We have previously reported the association of conventional risk factors with angiographically conﬁrmed obstructive coronary disease.1 Risk algorithms such as Framingham and SCORE were linearly associated with the extent of angiographic disease, but a number of common variables were poor indicators of CAD, including cholesterol, smoking, blood pressure and highsensitivity C-reactive protein, possibly due to high

rates of risk factor modiﬁcation with statins and antihypertensive therapy. There is a clear need for additional methods to improve diagnostic precision, particularly as the prevalence of nonobstructive CAD on angiography may be greater than 50% in some populations.2 3
Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive marker for the autonomic nervous system, which controls cardiac function via efferent ﬁbres to the vasculature, sino-atrial node and myocardium.4 Afferent ﬁbres contribute to feedback systems such as the baroreceptor reﬂex (stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch), the direct stretch reﬂex (sensitive to increased atrial volume) and the Bainbridge reﬂex (responding to higher central venous pressure). Power spectral density analysis deconstructs HRV into its component frequencies, graphing variance (power) as a function of frequency (see supplementary appendix, available online only). High frequency power (0.15e0.40 Hz) is thought to be mediated solely by the parasympathetic system,5e7 primarily attributable to respiration.8 9 The physiological correlate of low frequency (LF) power (0.04e0.15 Hz) is more contentious and is probably mediated by both branches of the autonomic nervous system.6
Pathological autonomic responses have been noted in patients with CAD and previous literature has shown that HRV can identify those at risk of death, and differentiate patients with a complicated course following myocardial infarction.10e13 Reduced HRV is a better predictor of arrhythmic complications, death after myocardial infarction and death due to progressive heart failure than traditional prognostic factors such as ventricular function.14e16 Low variability is also a predictor of all-cause mortality in those free of apparent CAD as well as in chronic heart failure.15 17 18 Despite these robust observations, HRV has not yet become a mainstream screening tool in the work-up of cardiac patients. Although unable to assess very low frequency oscillations, short duration HRV has distinct practical advantages to 24-h evaluation and a number of automated devices are now commercially available. We hypothesised that 5-min HRV would correlate with the burden of coronary atherosclerosis and be a useful clinical test, physiologically distinct from standard risk factors, to stratify the presence of angiographic coronary disease.
METHODS Five hundred and ﬁfty patients attending elective diagnostic coronary angiography were recruited in

Non-invasive testing

three angiographic centres in Melbourne, Australia, from 2006 to 2008. Participants were enrolled consecutively following written informed consent. The only exclusion criteria were a precipitating acute coronary syndrome and previous heart transplantation. All patients were assessed prospectively, before angiography, with the angiography operators blinded to the results. The study was approved by the local ethics committees and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Risk markers Detailed methods have previously been published.1 In summary, previous medical history, risk factors, medication history and measurements were obtained from the patient and their medical records and collated using a customised database (IM Medical Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). To estimate the overall baseline risk using conventional risk factors, Framingham scores were derived for each participant, which give an estimate of the 10-year absolute risk of total coronary disease events, including angina, recognised and unrecognised myocardial infarction and coronary deaths.19 Left ventricular function was determined by ventriculography during cardiac catheterisation or on recent echocardiography when this was contraindicated and categorised into impaired/non-impaired by the clinical operator.
Electrocardiograms (ECG) Twelve-lead ECGs were recorded using standard techniques with the participant supine using a commercially available portable ECG device (PC-ECG 1200; Norav Medical Ltd, Kiryat Bialik, Israel). ECG were assessed by an independent, blinded cardiologist for the presence of ischaemic features and rhythm abnormalities, and were classiﬁed as normal or abnormal.
Heart rate variability HRV was measured in all participants when a good quality ECG signal was obtainable and when QRS width and PR interval

were stable for correct acquisition of the RR interval. Three leads were used to obtain the ECG signal with participants lying supine, asked to breathe normally, and left undisturbed during the capture time (mean 5.3860.52 min). To simulate actual clinical use, no attempt was made to control patient or environmental factors (eg, coffee and alcohol consumption) or to rest the participant before HRV capture. SphygmoCor software (version 8; Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia) was used to quantify normal-to-normal RR intervals and deconstruct HRV into component frequencies, graphing variance as a function of frequency (power spectral density analysis; see supplementary appendix, available online only, for example).4
Coronary angiography Coronary angiography was performed by experienced operators using standardised procedures and guidelines and classiﬁed as angiographically normal, minor coronary irregularities or the presence of obstructive CAD ($50% stenosis in one or more native epicardial arteries or main tributary). For quality assurance, a random sample of 10% of angiograms at each centre were reviewed by two independent, experienced and blinded operators. In any situation in which there was uncertainty about classiﬁcation, angiograms were reassessed and a consensus achieved by discussion.
Statistics Values are presented as mean6SD, median6IQR or percentage. Categorical variables were compared with the c2 test and continuous variables with a two-tailed t test or non-parametric KruskaleWallis rank test. Trends in disease severity were established with the Cuzick and Altman test. OR for the presence of obstructive CAD were determined by logistic regression and are presented with 95% CI. The stepwise regression model included all variables presented in tables 1 and 2 plus dyspnoea

and the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, calcium channel blockers or vasodilators. A threshold of p<0.1 on likelihood ratio testing was used for variable inclusion. Variables signiﬁcant in univariate analysis were used in the ﬁxed multivariate model. Interactions were investigated for cross-tabulation of all variables and models were assessed for speciﬁcation, classiﬁcation and goodness of ﬁt using the HosmereLemeshow statistic. The cut-off value for LF power was determined using receiver operator curves with the Bayesian information criterion and the likelihood ratio test was used to conﬁrm the additive value of LF power to conventional risk factors. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Analyses were performed on Stata Intercooled (version 9.2).
RESULTS The study recruited 550 patients, of which 11 were excluded (ﬁve due to a preceding acute coronary syndrome, three due to unsuccessful coronary cannulation and three due to missing risk factor data). HRV measurement was successfully captured in 480 participants (89%). The most important factor limiting the acquisition of HRV was atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter, which occurred in 2.3% of those with successful capture and 17.5% of participants in whom HRV was unobtainable (p<0.0001). Excluding patients with atrial ﬁbrillation/ﬂutter had no effect on further analyses and therefore the data presented include all participants with successful HRV capture. Rhythm abnormalities on the ECG were the only independent factor associated with the absence of HRV measurements in multivariate analysis (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.74; p¼0.002). The ﬁnal sample size was 470, as 10 patients had uninterpretable ECG and were excluded. The majority of these patients (89.4%) were referred for angiography on the basis of cardiac symptoms. The remainder were referred to exclude CAD in patients with valve disease, heart failure, arrhythmias or for preoperative assessment.
Risk factor interactions There were no major interactions of 5-min LF power with conventional risk factors and only a weak correlation with heart rate (see ﬁgure 1). HRV was reduced in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes with median LF power (IQR) of 157 (387) ms2 versus 223 (400) ms2, respectively (p¼0.048). There was no effect of gender or smoking on HRV.

One hundred and forty-three participants (30%) were assessed in the afternoon, but no time-related effect was noted on any HRV parameter.
Association with angiographic CAD Table 1 displays baseline risk factors and selected medications according to the degree of angiographic disease for 470 participants with data available on all risk markers. Sixty per cent of patients assessed had obstructive CAD. Table 2 displays HRV and ECG parameters, demonstrating that a number of variables were crudely associated with the extent of angiographic CAD. LF power was statistically the most discriminating factor. There was a linear decrease in LF power as the extent of CAD worsened (p¼0.003), and the optimal cut-off value for obstructive disease was determined as 250 ms2. Figure 2 depicts the reduction in HRV frequency parameters according to the coronary artery territory affected. There was a uniform reduction in LF power by 25e30% irrespective of the anatomical location of CAD.
Predictors of obstructive CAD Reduced LF power was a strong and independent predictor of the presence of obstructive CAD in both stepwise and ﬁxed multivariate analysis (see table 3). The adjusted OR comparing LF power less than 250 ms2 and 250 ms2 or greater in the ﬁxed regression model was 2.42, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.38 (p¼0.004). The median value cut point for LF power (211 ms2) was also independently associated with obstructive CAD; adjusted OR of 1.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.34 (p¼0.037). ECG variables were not independent of other risk factors.
The clinical value of reduced HRV as a predictor of CAD was assessed in a variety of subgroups including patients with and without diabetes or previous cardiovascular disease and according to gender, age group, hypercholesterolaemia and by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. As demonstrated in ﬁgure 3, interaction p values were non-signiﬁcant for all subgroups and similarly according to left ventricular impairment (p¼0.331) and the presence of hypertension (p¼0.129). LF power less than 250 ms2 supplemented conventional risk factors and conversely removing this variable signiﬁcantly reduced the ﬁt of the model to the observed outcomes (p¼0.003 on likelihood ratio comparison). LF power provided additional risk stratiﬁcation with respect to the Framingham risk algorithm (ﬁgure 4A), and the overall model including HRV classiﬁed coronary

disease substantially better than Framingham variables alone (ﬁgure 4B).
DISCUSSION This study sought to determine the ability of a 5-min bedside HRV test to predict the presence of CAD. Our data demonstrate a high correlation of HRV with angiographically deﬁned disease in patients attending elective diagnostic coronary angiography. LF spectral power was inversely related to the extent of CAD and a cut-off value of 250 ms2 was identiﬁed as a strong independent predictor of obstructive disease in this clinical cohort. HRV was applicable across patient subgroups, added to conventional risk factor assessment and was superior to standard 12-lead ECG recordings.
Our data add to the body of evidence from previous studies linking HRV and CAD, although we focused on the prediction of obstructive CAD as deﬁned by the gold standard coronary

angiogram rather than clinical outcomes. Reduction in HRV as a surrogate for neurohormonal and sympathetic activation has been associated with CAD and impaired prognosis since the 1970s.4 Despite numerous trials with robust evidence linking reduced HRV to adverse outcomes, no study has previously examined the use of HRV with a simple and quick device in the clinical environment with an unselected population. Traditional evaluation using 24-h ECG recordings have inherent problems such as movement artefact, changes relating to the circadian rhythm, issues of data ﬁltering and the technical expertise required in translating results. Newer assessments of short duration HRV have considerable practical advantages and allow these technologies to be used with minimal training and a high degree of automation, while maintaining correlation with clinical events.10
A number of confounding variables have also limited the clinical use of HRV in the past, relating to both environmental

and patient factors, including respiration, posture and the time of recording, as well as the impact of coffee and alcohol. These relationships are also affected by the presence of CAD and risk factors, with a blunted response to tilt compared with patients without coronary disease20 and the usual circadian rhythm of autonomic tone notably diminished in patients with hypertension and CAD.20 21 Despite these issues and recruiting a clinical population with a wide variety of co-morbidities, our analysis conﬁrmed the value of HRV measurement. Unlike previous studies, no previous restrictions were placed on participants (such as a prolonged resting period) and no attempt was made to control breathing. The published literature suggests that the reproducibility of HRV is generally good for both healthy

populations and those with CAD,14 22 23 although day-to-day variations have been noted in some individuals.24 25
As discussed by Lahiri et al,26 the interplay of the autonomic
nervous system with cardiovascular physiology is complex;
however, our data would support the concept that the
predominance of sympathetic activation and/or reduction in
vagal tone may be a causative factor as well as a consequence of
CAD. Sympathetic predominance can cause a reduction in low
and high frequency HRV as well as total power (ie, reduced total variance in heart rate).4 27 Our analysis identiﬁed LF power as
the most sensitive predictor of coronary atheroma, even after
adjustment for the use of b-blockers and heart rate. Experi-
mental studies have identiﬁed dynamic changes in LF power in

patients with myocardial ischaemia during balloon coronary occlusion28 and direct correlations between LF power and the wall motion score index during dipyridamole on stress testing.29
Heart rate itself is a well documented marker of mortality.30 31 A higher heart rate decreases the duration of diastole, diminishing left ventricular ﬁlling and coronary artery perfusion. It also causes disruption of atherosclerotic plaques, promoting thrombus formation and myocardial infarction.32 33 Despite a progressive increase in overall mortality with heart rate in the Framingham cohort, the proportion of deaths speciﬁcally caused by cardiovascular disease was not different at any given heart rate.34 An excess of non-cardiovascular deaths at higher heart rates illustrates the poor speciﬁcity of heart rate as a marker of CAD. In our analysis, this association was confounded by the
high rate of b-blocker prescription (45% overall) and LF power
remained a more sensitive predictor of coronary disease. Although the Framingham risk score is deﬁned for a popula-
tion without preceding cardiovascular disease, the risk factors it contains are commonly used to stratify CAD risk in clinical practice. LF HRV discriminated obstructive angiographic CAD regardless of the baseline Framingham risk. The OR point estimate for LF power less than 250 ms2 remained similar in the crude analysis and after adjusting for conventional risk factors, albeit with a slightly broader CI, as would be expected. There was also a reasonable increase in the c-statistic, conﬁrming our previous hypothesis that conventional risk factors may be insufﬁcient in this population, particularly when there is a high degree of risk-modifying interventions.1 This is evidenced by the lack of modiﬁable risk factors such as blood pressure, smoking and lipid values in the ﬁnal multivariate model.
The limitations of our analysis are also potential strengths by simulating actual clinical application. Only a single measurement of HRV was obtained and no attempt was made to control environmental factors before recording. Correct capture of sinus RR intervals was dependent on automatic algorithms and patients with irregular cardiac rhythms or broad bundle branch blocks may fail to capture sufﬁcient RR intervals for an estimation of HRV. In our study HRV capture was unsuccessful in 11% of participants, which is an important clinical limitation of this technology. We did not assess the reproducibility of HRV measurement in our study due to the time constraints existing in the clinical setting, although earlier publications have addressed this issue, as noted above. Furthermore, we used Fourier transform algorithms, which are known to have less spectral deﬁnition than autoregressive or fractal analyses.4 The
400

population for this study was determined by referral for coronary angiography. We cannot exclude signiﬁcant veriﬁcation (or work-up) bias, but this was minimised by recruiting consecutive patients, not considering the reason for referral and subjecting all participants to the diagnostic and veriﬁcation tests.35
CONCLUSIONS Measuring HRV was simple, non-invasive and suitable for both primary care and hospital environments. Reduced LF power was a strong and independent predictor of obstructive angiographic coronary disease, regardless of baseline risk factors. Our results highlight that 5-min HRV is a potential clinical tool for risk stratiﬁcation in patients with sinus rhythm and not solely for research studies. Furthermore, the short duration of measurement has speciﬁc advantages in addition to practical considerations, including the assessment of HRV following changes in management and drug therapies.
