For example, the elephant is only 10 times longer than th the heart of an elephant weighs25, times as much as a rat heart. To more fully characterize the relations between AV transmission time and heart weight and size (roughly proportional to the third root of heart weight), it would be important to know the PR interval in mammals considerably larger than elephants. Earlier attempts to of sufficient quality to measure the P QRS duration in large whales, especially the gray whale (Eschrichriusrubusas), in their natural habitat were unsuccessful (1042). Therefore, we attempted to record the ECG in humpback whaler. (Megupteru novaeangIL4 (Fig. II.

with the help of the local cnvironmcntalisl., Dr. Jon Lien, succeeded in recording a I-lead EC6 in two humpback whales, each with an estimated lengthof 20feet i IO ml. The recordings were of suticient duration and quality to enable reliable assessment of P waves and QRS complexes; they were also adequate for measuring the PR interval and QRS duration (Fig. 2).
While the whales wcrc entrapped in the fishermen’s nets and under observation, they couldnot swimfar but were free to dive to nbout 5 m. They did not seem to be frightened, had no visible injuries and were easy to work with. After the study, all whales were released from the nets and some actually had to be encouraged to leave the site. They were in apparent good health at the time of their departure. During the 2-week period in the Newfoundland area, eight humpback whales were approached, but good quality ECG recordings could be obtained from only two.
ElectrocardiographicrecordingTso. obtain the recordings, a IO-cmdiameter suction electrode was placed just behind the left pectoral fin and served as a unipolar lead. The optimal location for the placement of rhe suction cup elcctrode on the humpback whale was selected by determining from autopsy the position of the heart in the thorax of one whale found dead in the area. The indifferentelectrode was placed in (sea) water. Through long coaxial cables, the eleWod6 were connected to a portable ECG recorder and a Halter monitor. In both whalesfrom whichadequate recordings were possible, about 20 min of recording was obtained. The signals on the Holter tape were transferred to TEACR-7I format.

singlebeats. Signal-averagingtechniques were required. The recordings were analyz.ed by means of 250digitalconversion and the software program (Asystawt)on a personal computer.
The RR interval histograms, and thus average were obtained by measuring only those intervals between two clearly identified QRST corn es that were relatively free from artifact so that the presence of more complexes within the intervals could be excluded. Therefore, the actual number of QRS-T omplexes on the tapes was greater than rhe number of R intervals used for the histograms.
From P-QRST complexes previously obtained from killer whales (Orckus ma) in sea aquaria in Vancouver, Canada, Mexico City, Mexico and Orlando, Florida, we had learned that the average amplitude of the P wave in these mammals is approximately 10%of that of the R wave. Estimating that approximately 100comple*4whale would be available for the averaging process, resulting in an expected IO-fold reduction in noise level, only those complexes surrounded by artifact and noise with an amplitude 40% of the R wave amplitude were used for averaging. These P-QRST complexes were selected by visual inspection. in the averaging process, R waves served as the central reference. This procedure resulted in one average P-QRST complex from which the variables could be measured in each whale (Fig. 3).
From the estimated length of both whales (approximately IOm each), their weightcould be estimated (13b).According to Slijper(14),for the humpback whale it isjustified to apply the rule of thumb of approximately 1 ton/foot. However, according to Evans (13b),the actual ratio may be closer to 1.5 tons/foot bringingthe whale’s body weight, at a conservative approximation, to 30,000kg and its heart weight to 140 to 180kg. The size of the whale heart, and thus the length of the His-Purkinjesystem, is aQQrOXimated as the third root of

The results are revealing because these observations demonstrate that in the hearts of these two whales, the PR interval and QRS duration are of the same order of magnitude as those in much smaller mammals such as horses and cattle (15).Kawamura(16)studied the length of the AV node in mammalian hearts of different sizes and found an almost linear relation between length and size. These data imply that the AV node in the humpback whales we studied must have been considerably longer and larger than that of a horse or cow, for example. The data confirm those of Clark (3)and our own hypotheses (6) regarding the apparent mismatch between AV transmission times and heart size in many species.

.tode contribution to AV transmission time seems to diminish as hearts get bigger, the protective function of the AV node against a rapid ventricular response to atrial tachycardia, flutter and fibrillationshould be maintained (24).Thus, after a certain body mass is reached, AV transmission time is no longera scaled physiologicvariable;that is, it does not vary systematically with body size (25). If there were no discontinuity in AV junctional function as expressed in Figure4, the PR interval in largewhaleswould easily exceed 1 to I .5 s. This increased value would almost certainly result in unwanted hemodynamic consequences (26). In other words, in large hearts, a proportionate increase in the PR interval would not further enhance the contribution of atrial systole to ventricular filling. Thus, in large mammals, rhc main task of the AV node, in addition to protective function
ainst atrialarrhythmias, seems to bc the finetuning of AV delay to create an optimal efficacyof the circulation under varying physiologicconditions.
Possible explanations for the observations presented here, and previous data demonstrating the constancy of AV transmissiontimes in species of widelydifferingsize, include the concept that the AV node does not “conduct” in the classic sense (23). Alternative electrophysiologic mechanisms may be involved (28-30)or conduction velocity must increase markedly by as yet unexplained mechanisms without affectingthe protective function of the AVjunction.
Ventricular excitation. The narrow QRS complexes in hearts as large as these whale hearts seem to point to an otherwise unlikely high conduction velocity in the HisPurkinje system (20).This could at least in part also contribute to the short PR interval. Hnwever, whales probably have a very dense Purkinje network (2l), as found in hoofed animals by Meylingand Ter Borg (311,an observation that may explain the limited QRS duration as a separate mechanism from the short PR interval.
Atrioventricular nude function. We present these data as a hitherto missingpiece in the knowledgeof comparative AV node function in mammals. In 1927,Clark (3) came to the conclusion that “The delay at the a.+. junction therefore varies relativelylittle in different species of Mammals,” We may add to this that an increase in AV node area is almost certainlynut accompaniedby an increasedtransmission time through this structure, the mechanismsfor which are as yet unclear.
The intriguingphenomena of a short PR interval and QRS duration in large mammals deserve further study and eventually an electrophysiologic, morphologic and biochemical explanation because, indeed, the rules governing the electrophysiolo.& functioning of the human heart should be applicablein the interpretation of comparative ECG findings and vice wmi (1). At present, this does not seem to be the case.
Conclusions. The PR interval (AVtransmissiontime) and QRS dudm (ventricular excitation) in a humpback whale ar\: extremely short in relation to its cardiac dimensions and the estimated length of th? AV and His-Purkinje system.

This findingcannot be satisfactorilyexplained on the basis of currently accepted electrophysiologic conduction theories. Alternative electrophysiologicand other mechanisms should be explored. Moreover, insight into AV node function is vital to our understanding of ventricular rate and rhythm in supraventricular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation
(32).
