Quantitative Probe of Beat-to-Beat Cardiovascular Control

Abstract.Power spectrumanalysis of heartratetuctuations providesa (quantitativenoninvasivemeansof assessing thefunctioningof theshort-termcardiovascular control'systems. We show that sympathetic,and parasympatheticnervouszactivity makefrequency-specificcontributionsto the heart rate power spectrum,and that renin-angiotensinsystem activity stronglymodulatesthe amplitudeof the spectral peak located at 0.04 hertz.

sis. This beat-to-beat variability was documentedby StephenHales (I) in the 18thcenturywhenhe performedthe first
quantitative measurements of arterial
bloodpressure.He notedthe correlation between the respiratory cycle, blood pressure level, and interbeat interval. Althoughphysicians have long considered the beat-to-beatvariationin heart rateor "thenormalsinusarrhythmia"as a salutarycardiovascularsign, its direct clinical importance was perhaps first demonstratedin the area of fetal monitoring(2). The diminutionof the beat-tobeat variationin the fetal heartrate dur-
ing labor signifiesfetal distress and the needforrapiddelivery.Despitethe longstandingrecognitionof beat-to-beatvariation in hemodynamicparametersand the establishedclinicalrelevanceof this variation, there have been remarkably few effortsto characterizemathematically the physiologicmechanismsthat generate these fluctuations.
It is currently believed that beat-tobeat fluctuations in hemodynamic parametersreflectthe dynamicresponseof the cardiovascularcontrol systems to a
host of naturallyoccurringphysiological perturbationsF. or example,centralarterialandvenous bloodpressuresare continuallyperturbedas a result of the cyclic variation in intrathoracicpressure associated with respirationand also by

also periodic fluctuations in heart rate occurringat lower frequencies.Accordingly, the power spectrum(see Fig. la) of the heartrate fluctuationscontainnot only a peak centered at the respiratory frequency but also peaks at two lower frequencies,typically 0.04 and 0.12 Hz. The work of Hyndman and Kitney (6) suggests that the low-frequencypeak is relatedto cyclic fluctuationsin peripheral vasomotortone associated with ther¢loregulation,whereas the mid-frequency peak is related to the frequency response of the baroreceptorreflex.
To study the frequency-specificcontributionsof each of the principalcardiovascular control systems to the genesis of the heart rate fluctuations,we have ¢leasured the power spectrum of these fluctuations in trained, conscious, unanesthetizeddogs. In these experiments the differentcardiovascularcontrol systems were selectively blocked by means of specific pharmacologicagents: glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg, administeredas an intravenousbolus)to block muscarinic parasympathetictransmission; propranolol(0.1 mg/kg, intravenousbolus) to block the sympathetic -adrenergic receptors; and nonapeptide converting enzyme inhibitor (0.3 mg/kg, intravenous bolus followed by infusion, 0.003 ¢lg/kg per minute) to block the reninangiotensinsystem. Adequacyof blockade was demonstratedby abolition of response to administrationof, respectively, acetylcholine, isoproterenol, or angiotensinI.
Arterialand venous indwellingcatheters were implantedin the traineddogs. During each experiment the arterial blood pressure, surface electrocardiogram (ECG), and respiratory activity were continuously monitored and recordedon a Hewlett-Packard3968AFM rnagnetictape recorder. An electronic device was used to detect the R waves from the recorded ECG and then to automaticallymeasure and digitize the RRintervalsequence;a NOVA computer was used to computethe power spectrumof the heart rate fluctuationsfrom the RR interval sequence. Typically, S minutesof real-timestationarydatawere used to computethe power spectrumin the band from 0.02 to 1.0 Hz. Prior to each pharmacologic intervention, 20 minutesof baseline data were obtained. To confirmthe stationarityof the data, and the reproducibilityof the measure¢lents, we examined multiple consecu-
tive 300-second blocks of data under both controlandpostinterventionconditions. We found that the spectral peak areas varied by no more than S to 10 percent. Multipleexperimentswere per-

The heart rate power spectrumin the dogcontainsthe threepeaksdescribedin the humanby Sayers(4) (Fig. la). In any given spectrumone or more of the three peaks may not be evident because of low amplitudeor overlap. Furthermore,the high-frequencypeak will not be present if the respiratoryrate exceeds the mean heartrate. Figurelb illustratesthe effect of parasympatheticblockadewith glycopyrrolate;the mid- and high-frequency peaksare abolished,while the amplitude of the low-frequency peak is reduced. Combined-sympathetic and parasympatheticblockadeabolishesall heartrate fluctuationsleadingto a metronome-like heartbeat(Fig. lb). Sympatheticblockade alone tends to reduce the low-frequencypeak's amplitude,but this effect is not consistentbecause of the low tonic level of sympatheticactivity in the resting dog. To better characterizethe effects of autonomic activity on the lowfrequencypeak, we varied the levels of autonomicnervous activity reflexogenically by varyingarterialblood pressure. Arterial pressure was manipulated by continuousintravenousinfusionof either the vasodilatorsodium nitroprussideor the vasoconstrictor methoxamine. Under conditions of -sympathetic blockade, increasingarterialpressure which reflexively increases parasympathetic activity increases the area under the low-frequency peak. Under conditions of parasympatheticblockade,decreasing arterialpressure which reflexively increases -sympathetic activity-also increasesthe areaunderthe low-frequency peak (Fig. lc). Thus, increasingthe activity of either the sympatheticor parasympathetic nervous system augments

the area underthe low-frequencypeak. Therefore,ourdataindicatethatthe parasympathetic nervous system mediates heart rate fluctuationsat frequencies correspondingto the mid- and high-frequency peaks of the power spectrum, whereasboth the sympatheticand parasympathetic systems may mediate the low-frequencyfluctuations.
Finally, we tested the effect of selective blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. In three of fouranimalsso studied we observed a 2- to 4.5-fold increase in the areaunderthe low-frequencypeak (Fig. ld). In the fourthdog, whichwas at autopsyfound to have heartworms,this response was not noted.
Inthe restingdog on a normalsaltdiet, blockadeof the renin-angiotensinsystem leads to littleor no changein meanheart rateor meanarterialpressure.However, the data presented here clearly indicate thatsuchblockadecanleadto a dramatic alteration in low-frequency heart rate fluctuations.We believe that this noninvasive analysis provides the first direct evidence that the renin-angiotensinsystem plays a significantrole in short-term cardiovascularregulation.
The physiologic basis for our results can be understoodin terms of a simple block diagram(Fig. 2). The sympathetic and parasympatheticnervous systems are directly responsible for modulating heartrate in response to fluctuationsin sensed variables such as arterialblood pressure.However, the responsetime of the parasympatheticnervous system is muchshorterthanthatof the sympathetic nervous system (7). Therefore, only the parasympatheticnervous system reacts rapidly enough to mediate highfrequencyfluctuationsin heartrate correspondingto the mid-andhigh-frequency peaks of the spectrum.Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are capableof mediatingheartrate fluctuationsin the rangeof the low-frequency peak. Thusthe changein power spectrumof heartratefluctuationswith autonomic blockade can be understoodsimply in terms of the band-passproperties of these systems.
To understandthe effect of converting enzymeinhibitor,we note thatthe origin of the low-frequencypeak in the heart ratepower spectrumprobablyoriginates fromfluctuationin peripheralvasomotor tone, leadingto perturbationsin central venous and arterial pressures (6). Our datasuggestthe possibilitythatthe tonic activity of the renin-angiotensinsystem normallydamps the amplitudeof these fluctuations in peripheral vasomotor tone;blockingthe renin-angiotensinsystem leads to a large increase in the

amplitudeof these fluctuationsin vasomotortone and thus the perturbationto sensed blood pressures. These larger
perturbations,occurring at frequencies of about 0.04 Hz, are in turn translated into heart rate fluctuationsat these frequencies through the mediation of the autonomicnervous system (8). Ourdata stronglysuggestthat the renin-angiotensin system indeed plays an important role in maintainingthe short-termstability of the cardiovascularsystem under

key, E. K. Potter, J. Physiol. (London) 294, 69 (1978)] have shown that angiotensin II inhibits vagal parasympathetic outflow through a central nervous mechanism. Thus blockade of the re-
nin-angiotensin system might be expected to increase vagal activity, which should increase all peaks in the power spectrum. Our data show a dramatic selective effect on the low-frequency peak, which cannot be attributed therefore merely to an increase in overall vagal activity. We believe this frequency-specific effect is probably due to changes in the amplitude of the fluctuations of the peripheral resistance upon blockade of the renin-angiotensin systems. 9.
