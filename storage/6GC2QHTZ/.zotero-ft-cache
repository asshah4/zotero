Abstract 
 
Nocardia, a gram-positive bacillus with the microscopic appearance of branching hyphae, can produce considerable disease in the appropriate host. The taxonomy of Nocardia continues to evolve; more than 50 species have been described. Early recognition and effective therapy are imperative to achieve successful outcomes. Although nocardiosis typically occurs in patients with cell-mediated immunosuppressive conditions, infection may occasionally develop in immunocompetent patients as well. This review addresses the microbiology of Nocardia , risk factors for infection, clinical presentations, and management strategies.

The genus Nocardia is a ubiquitous group of environmental bacteria that usually manifest as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised hosts. Nocardia can be found in soil, decomposing vegetation, and other organic matter, as well as in fresh and salt water. Both Nocardia and Rhodococcus are members of the family Nocardiaceae, which belongs to a suborder of “aerobic actinomycetes” that also includes Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium, Gordona, and Tsukamurella . 
 
The taxonomy of Nocardia has been challenging because numerous revisions have been made with the identification of more than 50 species. What was originally referred to as Nocardia asteroides was later found to be a group of bacteria with a heterozygous pattern of antimicrobial drug susceptibilities. 1 x 1 Wallace, R.J. Jr, Steele, L.C., Sumter, G., and Smith, J.M. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Nocardia asteroides . Antimicrob Agents Chemother . 1988 ; 32 : 1776–1779 
 
Crossref | PubMed See all References 1 Subsequently named N asteroides complex, this group of bacteria is responsible for most clinical human nocardial infections. N asteroides complex was later separated and reorganized into different species on the basis of drug susceptibility patterns: Nocardia abscessus, Nocardia brevicatena-paucivorans complex, Nocardia nova complex (which includes N nova, Nocardia veterana, Nocardia africana, Nocardia kruczakiae ), Nocardia transvalensis complex , Nocardia farcinica, and N asteroides. 2 Nocardia cyriacigeorgica was recently differentiated from N asteroides and is becoming a more frequently identified clinically relevant pathogen. 3 x 3 Schlaberg, R., Huard, R.C., and Della-Latta, P. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica , an emerging pathogen in the United States. J Clin Microbiol . 2008 ; 46 : 265–273

Nocardia is a gram-positive bacterium that grows aerobically. Unlike other gram-positive bacteria, Nocardia appears as a filamentous bacterium with hyphaelike branching on direct microscopy. Nocardia exhibits varying degrees of acid-fastness, depending on the mycolic acid composition in the cell wall and type of stain used. 2 x 2 Brown-Elliott, B.A., Brown, J.M., Conville, P.S., and Wallace, R.J. Jr. Clinical and laboratory features of the Nocardia spp. based on current molecular taxonomy. Clin Microbiol Rev . 2006 ; 19 : 259–282 
 
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (398) See all References 2 The modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain uses 1% sulfuric acid as a decolorizer (instead of the more potent hydrochloric acid used in the decoloration step in the Ziehl-Neelsen staining procedure), which enhances the ability of Nocardia to retain the colored fuchsin. 4 x 4 McNeil, M.M. and Brown, J.M.

PubMed See all References 4 Unlike mycobacteria, Nocardia has a “beaded” acid-fast appearance on microscopy. Nocardia can resemble Actinomyces species on Gram stain; however, Actinomyces species are not acid-fast and grow under anaerobic conditions. 
Risk Factors for Infection 
 
Nocardia usually is an “opportunistic pathogen,” with the majority of infections occurring in patients with immunosuppressive conditions. Up to one-third of patients with nocardiosis, however, are immunocompetent. 5 x 5 Beaman, B.L., Burnside, J., Edwards, B., and Causey, W. Nocardial infections in the United States, 1972-1974. J Infect Dis . 1976 ; 134 : 286–289 
 
Crossref | PubMed See all References 5 Irrespective of a patient's immunologic status, the isolation of Nocardia from the respiratory tract or other body source should not be regarded as a contaminant or commensal organism. Patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity especially are at high risk for infection, including those with lymphoma, other selected malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and solid-organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant and those receiving long-term treatment with steroids or other medications that suppress cell-mediated immunity. 6 x 6 Young, L.S. and Rubin, R.H.

Clinical Presentations 
 
Pulmonary nocardiosis is the most common clinical presentation of infection because inhalation is the primary route of bacterial exposure. The onset of symptoms may be subacute to more chronic and can include productive or nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and progressive fatigue. The chest radiograph can be variable, displaying focal or multifocal disease with nodular and/or consolidation infiltrate as well as cavitary lesions. 18 x 18 Beaman, B.L. and Beaman, L.

Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (63) See all References Pleural effusions can develop in up to one-third of patients. It can be very difficult clinically and radiographically to differentiate Nocardia from filamentous fungal (eg, aspergillosis, mucormycosis) or mycobacterial disease ( Table 1 Table 1 ). Occasionally, Nocardia may be identified from the respiratory tract in a person without apparent pulmonary infection. Nocardia isolation without apparent pulmonary infection can be encountered in patients with underlying structural lung disease, such as bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis, 2 x 2 Brown-Elliott, B.A., Brown, J.M., Conville, P.S., and Wallace, R.J. Jr. Clinical and laboratory features of the Nocardia spp. based on current molecular taxonomy. Clin Microbiol Rev . 2006 ; 19 : 259–282 
 
Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (398) See all References 2 and should be interpreted cautiously. The identification of Nocardia from an immunocompromised patient should never be ignored, especially if any abnormal clinical or radiologic pulmonary findings are present.

Extrapulmonary nocardiosis is relatively common and can occur through hematogenous dissemination or a contiguous spread of necrotizing pneumonitis into the pleura, pericardium, mediastinum, and vena cava. Abscess formation is characteristic of extrapulmonary nocardiosis and can resemble a pyogenic bacterial process or evolve into a chronic granulomatous or mixed progressive inflammatory mass. The central nervous system (CNS) is the most common extrapulmonary location for nocardiosis (up to 44% in one series). 18 x 18 Beaman, B.L. and Beaman, L.

PubMed See all References Polymicrobial bloodstream infections with Nocardia and gram-negative bacilli have also been identified. Hematogenously disseminated nocardiosis has led to infection in the eyes (keratitis), heart valves, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, thyroid gland, and organ tissues. 
Treatment Considerations 
 
General treatment recommendations for nocardiosis are hindered by the lack of prospective controlled trials. Optimal antimicrobial treatment regimens have not been firmly established. Nocardia displays variable in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and management of nocardial infections must be individualized. 26 x 26 Munoz, J., Mirelis, B., Aragon, L.M. et al.

Crossref | Scopus (30) See all References 28 Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the most commonly used sulfonamide preparation in the United States, although the benefit of the trimethoprim component is unclear. Divided doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg per day of the trimeth-o-prim component (or 25 to 50 mg/kg per day of sulfamethoxazole) are recommended to produce sulfonamide serum concentrations between 100 and 150 μg/mL. Adverse reactions to high-dose TMP-SMX therapy are frequent and include myelosuppression, hepatoxicity, and renal insufficiency. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is active against most Nocardia species ; however, N otitidiscaviarum is commonly resistant to TMP-SMX, and N nova and N farcinica are occasionally resistant. 22 x 22 Lerner, P.I.

Crossref | PubMed See all References For most forms of nocardiosis, initial combination drug therapy is recommended. In patients with CNS disease, therapy should include drugs with favorable CNS penetration (eg, TMP-SMX and ceftriaxone). Patients with severe nocardiosis may benefit from the addition of a third agent, such as linezolid. Combination therapy should continue until clinical patient improvement occurs and Nocardia species identification and antimicrobial drug susceptibility information can be confirmed. Single-drug therapy may suffice thereafter. Duration of treatment is generally prolonged to minimize risk of disease relapse. Immunocompetent patients with pulmonary or multifocal (non-CNS) nocardiosis may be successfully treated with 6 to 12 months of antimicrobial therapy. Immunosuppressed patients and those with CNS disease should receive at least 12 months of antimicrobial therapy with the appropriate clinical monitoring. 
 
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole provides effective prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia and also can decrease the risk of nocardial infections. Daily TMP-SMX prophylaxis most reliably prevents nocardiosis and may also account for the decreased prevalence of nocardiosis in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. 36 x 36 Peterson, P.K., Ferguson, R., Fryd, D.S., Balfour, H.H.

Conclusion 
 
Increases in the number of patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies for solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplants, hematologic and solid tissue cancers, and autoinflammatory conditions, ensure that Nocardia will remain a formidable pathogen. Although this organism is capable of producing serious and metastatic disease in the appropriate host, early recognition and initiation of appropriate treatment can lead to successful outcomes.
