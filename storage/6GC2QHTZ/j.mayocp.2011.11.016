The taxonomy of Nocardia continues to evolve; more than 50 species have been described. Early recognition and effective therapy are imperative to achieve successful outcomes. Although nocardiosis typically occurs in patients with cell-mediated immunosuppressive conditions, infection may occasionally develop in immunocompetent patients as well. This review addresses the microbiology of Nocardia, risk factors for infection, clinical presentations, and management strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":1564015,"pct":77,"higher_than":5562635},"journal":{"count":1808,"mean":18.624233536248,"rank":695,"pct":60,"higher_than":1101},"similar_age_3m":{"count":288996,"mean":6.458580646724,"rank":72926,"pct":74,"higher_than":214305},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":77,"mean":10.198947368421,"rank":32,"pct":55,"higher_than":43}},"type":"article","altmetric_id":1116337,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":1,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":2,"last_updated":1478808170,"score":3.5,"history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.11.016","added_on":1355186410,"published_on":1333584000,"subjects":["medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"readers":{"citeulike":"1","mendeley":"69","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":70,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=4&types=ttttwwww","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=4&types=ttttwwww","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=4&types=ttttwwww"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1116337"})
