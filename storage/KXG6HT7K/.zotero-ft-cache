Introduction
• Sentence prosody encompasses intonation, phrasal rhythmic patterning, and prosodic phrasing.
• Article examines the relations between these aspects of sentence prosody and the relation of sentence prosody to the meaning of the sentence.
• Main claims for English:
• Distribution of pitch accents constrains focus structure of the sentence, which constrains possible meanings
• Distribution of pitch accents constrains rhythmic stress patterns of the sentence
• Intonation—not the phrasal stress pattern—mediates the meaning-sentence prosody relation

The Grammar of Intonation
• Presence of a pitch accent implies that the word is focused: different distributions of pitch accents imply different focus structures.
• A wh- expression focuses a constituent; an appropriate answer focuses the same constituent.
• Focus = “the focus of the sentence”; it introduces a set of alternatives into the discourse
• A constituent that answers a wh- question is F-marked. • The central problem in the characterization of the
prosody-focus relation is focus projection:
• What principles govern the relation between pitch accent and Fmarking?
4

The Grammar of Intonation
• Chomsky and Halle’s Nuclear Stress Rule (NSR):
• Main stress = rightmost word-level stress of a phrase • Pitch accent is on main stress within F-marked constituent • [.....σmain stress.....]F → [….. σmain stress.....]F
|
pitch accent
• NSR does not predict the correct location of pitch accent within a focused constituent.
• Selkirk proposes argument-structure-based account of focus projection.
5
The Grammar of Intonation
• Basic Focus Rule:
• Accent → F-marking
• Focus Projection:
(a) (F-marking of head of phrase → F-marking of phrase) ν (F-marking of head of phrase → ¬F-marking of phrase)
(b) (F-marking of internal argument of head → F-marking of head) ν (F-marking of internal argument of head → ¬F-marking of head)
(c) (F-marking of constituent → F-marking of its trace) ν (F-marking of constituent → ¬F-marking of its trace)
7

The Grammar of Intonation
• Basic Focus Rule:
• An accented word is F-marked.
• Focus Projection:
(a) F-marking of the head of a phrase licenses the F-marking of the phrase.
(b) F-marking of an internal argument of the head licenses the Fmarking of the head.
(c) F-marking of a constituent licenses F-marking of its trace.
• Focus of the sentence (FOC or Focus):
– F-marked constituent not dominated by another F-marked constituent.

The Grammar of Intonation
Examples:
Mary bought a book about [BATS]F.
(What did Mary buy a book about?)
Mary bought a book [about BATS]F.
(What kind of book did Mary buy?)
Mary bought [a book about BATS]F.
(What did Mary buy?)
Mary [bought a book about BATS]F.
(What did Mary do?)
[Mary bought a book about BATS]F.
(What’s been happening?)
8

The Grammar of Intonation
Examples following Selkirk:
Mary bought a book about FOC[[BATS]F]FOC. Mary bought a book FOC[[about]F [[BATS]F]F]FOC. Mary bought FOC[a [book]F [[about]F [[BATS]F]F]F]FOC. Mary FOC[[bought]F [a [book]F [[about]F [[BATS]F]F]F]F]FOC. FOC[Mary [[bought]F [a [book]F [[about]F [[BATS]F]F]F]F]F]FOC.
9
The Grammar of Intonation
• Selkirk’s theory differs from NSR in its ability to account for:
• the relation between accent and the given-new structure of the sentence.
• the lack of focus projection from accents in positions where main phrase stress would be predicted.
• the projection of focus from accents in positions not defined as main phrase stress.
How to interpret Selkirk’s machinery: • F-marked constituents which are not FOC are new. • Constituents without F-marking are given. • The FOC constituent is given or new.
11

The Grammar of Intonation
How to get sentence FOC:
FOC[Mary [[bought]F [a [book]F [[about]F [[BATS]F]F]F]F]F]FOC. (by Focus Projection (a))
10
The Grammar of Intonation
Examples of new and given constituents:
What’s been happening?
FOC[Mary [[bought]F [a [book]F [[about]F [[BATS]F]F]F]F]F]FOC.
→ Mary must be given Who bought a book about bats?
FOC[[MARY]F]FOC bought a book about bats.
→ Mary can be given or new What’s been happening?
FOC[[MARY]F [[bought]F [a [book]F [[about]F [[BATS]F]F]F]F]F]FOC.
→ Mary must be new
12

The Grammar of Intonation
The theory correctly predicts:
The “deaccenting” puzzle: FOC[[[MARY]F]F [[bought]F [a [BOOK]F [[about] [[bats]]]]F]F]FOC. Sentence focus with accented auxiliary: FOC[[Mary] [[DID]F [buy a book about bats]]F]FOC. Adjunt phrases in post-head position don’t project: He only smoked FOC[in the TENT]FOC. *He only FOC[smoked in the TENT]FOC. He only FOC[SMOKED in the TENT]FOC. cf. He only FOC[looked at the GARDEN]FOC. (post verbal PP is argument)
13
The Grammar of Intonation
The theory correctly predicts (cont.):
Sentence focus for individual level vs. stage-level predicate:
Stage level: subject raised from deep structure position within VP
FOC[Your EYES are red]FOC (red is stage-level when predicated of eyes) FOC[Your EYES are RED]FOC
Individual level: surface subject controls VP-internal PRO
*FOC[Your EYES are blue]FOC FOC[Your EYES are BLUE]FOC
15

The Grammar of Intonation
The theory correctly predicts (cont.):
FOC[[[JOHN]F1]F2 VP[[t]F3 [died]F4]F5]FOC. (can be BF) FOC[I heard [[a [CLOCK]F]F VP[[t]F [tick]F]F]F]FOC. (can be BF) FOC[I forced FOC[the [CLOCK]F]FOC to VP[PRO [tick]]]. (cannot be BF)
Sentence focus for event reading vs. generic reading:
Event reading: subject raised from deep structure position within VP
FOC[TRESpassers will be prosecuted]FOC
Generic reading: surface subject controls VP-internal PRO
FOC[TRESpassers will be PROsecuted]FOC
14
Intonational Phrasing
• Phrasing, but not metrical information, is important for a fuller understanding of the relation between sentence prosody, meaning and discourse.
• Phrasing is related to notions of Topic and Focus.
• Examples:
(a) IP(Three mathematicians in ten)IP IP(derive a lemma)IP. (a) *IP(Three mathematicians)IP IP(in ten derive a lemma)IP. (a) IP(Three mathematicians)IP IP(intend to rival Emma)IP.

On the Limits of Focus Projection in English
Carlos Gussenhoven
LING795K Anouschka Bergmann
May 16, 2005
Introduction
• Radical Focus-To-Accent view:
• Bolinger: there is no focus projection beyond the word the pitch accent is placed on.
• Restricted focus projection:
• Schmerling / Fuchs / Gussenhoven / Ladd / Baart: arguments can project focus to adjacent predicates
• Extended focus projection:
• Schmerling / Selkirk / Steedman: allows for focus to project upward to larger constituents and ultimately to the sentence

Introduction
• Gussenhoven’s objections to Selkirk:
• Extended view of focus projection leads to the presence of old information inside the focus constituent. This leads to too much machinery since both focus projection rules and interpretation rules are needed.
• Restricted view of focus projection is conceptually simpler.
• Extended view of focus projection faces empirical difficulties.
20

Restricted View of Focus Projection
• Sentence Accent Assignment Rule (SAAR):
• Every focused argument (A), modifier (M), and predicate (P) is accented, with the exception of a predicate that is adjacent to one of its arguments.
• Accents are abstract placeholders, marking locations that will be filled with a pitch accent if they survive the actions of various deletion rules.
21
Obligatory Prenuclear Pitch Accents
• Gussenhoven disagrees with the belief that a full-focus version of a sentence is always equivalent to a narrow focus version with the focus on the last pitch accented word.
• Instead he suggests:
(a) What’s John tickling Mary with? John’s tickling Mary with a FEATHER.
(b) What’s going on? *John’s tickling Mary with a FEATHER.
(c) What’s John tickling Mary with? JOHN’s tickling MARY with a FEATHER.
(d) What’s going on? JOHN’s tickling MARY with a FEATHER.
23

Restricted View of Focus Projection
• Deletion rules (focus projection rules):
• Deaccent every A, P, and M outside the focus cpnstituent.
• Deaccent a focused P that is adjacent—disregarding any intervening nonfocused A or M—to an accented A.
• Prefocal pitch accents:
• Assign pitch accents to the constituents before the nuclear pitch accent. (Optional)
22

Extended Focus Projection
• Objection to Selkirks’s assumption that FOC should be a constituent:

Example:
• What did she do with the book? [She [[sent]F a book [to [MARY]F]F]F]Foc.

Following to Selkirk, we get:

• Focus:

She sent a book to Mary.

• New:

sent a book to Mary, sent, to Mary, Mary

• Given:

She, a book

• Given or New:

She sent a book to Mary

24

Extended Focus Projection
Other counterexamples:
• [She [[SENT]F a book to Mary]F]Foc. Selkirk’s theory suggests that the VP sent a book to Mary can be interpreted as new. But the context: “What did she do?” is inappropriate.
• What happened? (a) FOC[[[JOHNSON]F]F [[t]F [died]F]F]FOC. (b) MARY bought a book about bats. Selkirk’s theory does not explain why (b) is not a possible reply to “What happened?” Why would (a) have a trace and not (b)?
25
The Restricted View: Discontinuous Focus
Minimal pair of discontinuous focus / multiple foci:
• Was hat das Kind erlebt? KARL hat dem Kind einen FÜLLER geschenkt. [Karl…einen Füller geschenkt]FOC
• Wer hat was hinsichtlich des Kindes getan? KARL hat dem Kind einen FÜLLER geschenkt. [Karl]FOC [einen Füller geschenkt]FOC (cf. Höhle 1982)
(FOC here not Selkirk’s FOC)
27

The Restricted View: Discontinuous Focus
Gussenhoven’s account of previous example:
• What did she do with the book? [She [[sent]F a book [to [MARY]F]F]F]Foc.
• By focus projection rules, either (to) Mary or sent to Mary is [+focus]
• Example shows that focus can be discontinuous. • The notion of discontinuous focus should be
distinguished from the notion of multiple foci.
26
The Restricted View: Discontinuous Focus
• In restricted focus projection theories, the need for a separate set of focus interpretation rules never arises.
• Focus projection principles should in themselves suffice to identify the focused (new) status of the constituents in a sentence.
• Restricted Focus Projection: Pitch Accent distribution ↔ Focus distribution
• Extended Focus Projection: Pitch Accent distribution ↔ Focus distribution ↔ Focus interpretation
28

Two Arguments for Extended Focus Projection Refuted
• Selkirk’s example of sentence focus with accented auxiliary: FOC[[Mary] [[DID]F [buy a book about bats]]F]FOC.
• Gussenhoven suggests that there is no need to assume sentence focus.
• This could be a reply to the implied question: Which of the information contained in NEG,PAST[Mary buy a book about bats] is incorrect?
• NEG is taken as the focus (“counterassertive focus”, which needs to be distinguished from “counterpresuppositional focus”)
29

“Restricted” Focus Projection in Complex Sentences

• What’s going on with him?

(to look OUT)Pred (for a MANiac)Arg

out

1. cycle

(was WARNED)Pred (to look out for a MANiac)Arg warned

2. cycle

He [was warned to look out for a MANiac]FOC.

Output

31

Two Arguments for Extended Focus Projection Refuted
• Selkirk’s example:
I was only thinking that FOC[MARY bought a BOOK about bats]FOC. (only dominates embedded S, therefore S must be focus)
• Counterexamples:
• Were you thinking that they might catch a cold or what? I was only thinking FOC[that they wouldn’t fit into the PHONE booth]FOC.
• Were you perhaps thinking that they wouldn’t fit into the spare bedroom? I was only thinking that they wouldn’t fit FOC[into the PHONE booth]FOC.
30

“Restricted” Focus Projection in Complex Sentences

• Why weren’t you admitted to the Poets’ Club?

(a BIRD)Arg (SING)Pred sing

1. cycle

(to HEAR)Pred (a BIRD sing)Arg hear

2. cycle

(FAILED)Pred (to hear a BIRD sing)Arg failed

3. cycle

I [failed to hear a BIRD sing]FOC.
