Although the occurrence of normal coronary arteriograms in patients with angina1 pain is now recognized as a clinical entity, a large-scale study of such patients has not been reported. Accordingly, the historic aspects, laboratory findings and subsequent clinical course of 200 subjects (101 men and 99 women) with this syndrome were analyzed. Their average age was 47 years. No specific feature in the history could be discerned which separated these patients from those with angina due to coronary heart disease. The frequency of noncardiac sources of chest pain was similar in all patients. The electrocardiogram demonstrated abnormalities in the ST-T waves in slightly over 50 per cent of the patients, and the postexercise electrocardiogram was abnormal in another 20 per cent. Objective evidence for myocardial ischemia (myocardial lactate production) was three times more frequent in women than in men. The frequency of carbohydrate and/or lipid abnormalities was approximately half that in patients with coronary heart disease and did not correlate with the presence of myocardial ischemia. Long-term follow-up of these patients indicated that over half showed gradual improvement without specific therapy, whereas only 8 per cent had an increase in chest pain. Six patients died (four of unknown cause) in an average follow-up period of three years. Mortality, however, as determined by the life table method, was no greater than in a sex-age matched cohort derived from actuarial data. Although the etiology of this syndrome has not yet been demonstrated, its prognosis both in terms of persistence of pain and mortality appears to be benign.

After nearly two centuries of controversy, the classic studies of

Blumgart and others [1,2] seemed to establish coronary ath-

erosclerosis as the underlying pathologic condition in patients

with angina pectoris. Because angina is a syndrome defined by

history, it was inferred that inaccuracy in evaluating the history

accounted for any exceptions that occurred. Yet, scrutiny of

the data of Blumgart et al. reveals that a small percentage of

patients who apparently had classic angina pectoris during life

had no significant coronary atherosclerosis,

aortic valve dis-

ease or evidence of hypertensive vascular disease at postmor-

tem.

raphy re-awakened interest in this apparently set-

tled issue because arteriograms did not always

confirm the angina1 histories. Several centers

have reported normal coronary arteriograms in as

many as 30 per cent of the patients with chest

pain suggestive of ischemic heart disease. Nar-

rowing the issue to patients whose chest pain is

predominantly

related to exertion, approximately

10 per cent are free of major vessel coronary dis-

ease as defined by arteriography [3-61. Both the

etiology and pathophysiology

of this type of chest

pain remain unknown.

Our purpose here is to review a six year experi-

ence with patients who had chest pain but whose

coronary arteriograms were normal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two hundred subjects with chest pain suggestive of

coronary artery disease, who were subsequently found

to have normal coronary arteriograms, were studied at

the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital between January

1964 and January 1970. These subjects comprise the

study population. The group was made up of 101 men

and 99 women ranging in age from 19 to 68 years (av-

erage 47 years). Subjects were admitted to the study

population consecutively.

History and Physical.

A standardized

history was

taken independently by at least two staff members of

the Cardiovascular

Division. This history included gen-

eral characterization

of the pain: precipitation by exer-

tion, emotion and cold weather; occurrence at night

and during or after eating; relief by rest or nitroglycer-

in; and radiation. Each subject had chest pain with

some characteristic

or combination of characteristics

sufficient to suggest the pain of ischemic heart dis-

ease. For purposes of this study patients who had

smoked at least l/2 pack of cigarettes for at least

one year were classified as smokers. A thorough physical examination was performed. Diastolic blood

pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg (or his-

tory of such an elevation) was regarded as evidence

of hypertension. The subjects in the study were sepa-

rated into two groups on the basis of the historic infor-

mation obtained. Those in group 1 (88 subjects) had a

history of chest pain predominantly brought on by

exertion and relieved by rest. Those in group 2 had a

history of chest pain which was not predominantly re-

lated to exertion. The historic evaluation of these two

groups will be discussed further.

Laboratory Data. An intravenous glucose tolerance

test was performed in 114 subjects. In the majority it

was accomplished two days after hospitalization while

they were on a high carbohydrate diet. After an over-

night fast, glucose (0.5 g/kg body weight) was given

intravenously, and blood samples were analyzed for

glucose content at 10 minute intervals for one hour. A

rate constant was determined as K = 70/t l/2 in min.

K values less than or equal to 1.0 were considered to

indicate abnormal glucose tolerance. Fasting blood

samples were drawn on the day of admission and ana-

lyzed for cholesterol (190 subjects) and triglyceride

(155 subjects) content. Cholesterol values in excess

of 300 mg/lOO ml and triglyceride values in excess of

200 mg/lOO ml were considered abnormal. Because

lipoprotein electrophoresis

was not available in pa-

tients studied prior to 1967, this information is not re-

ported herein.

Extracardiac

sources of pain were studied in 155

subjects by means of an x-ray series of the upper gas-

trointestinal tract, a cholecystogram

and x-ray exami-

nation of the cervicodorsal spine. During the series of

x-ray films of the gastrointestinal

tract, the subject

was specifically examined in the Trendelenberg

posi-

tion for hiatus hernia. Nonvisualized gallbladders were

reexamined by administering

a double dose of the

contrast agent. Films were interpreted by the Radiolo-

gy Department of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and

reviewed as well by staff members of the Cardiovas-

cular Division.

Electrocardiography

and Exercise Tests. A standard

12 lead electrocardiogram

was obtained in all 200

subjects at rest. One hundred and twenty subjects

who were not taking digitalis were exercised utilizing

Master’s double 2-step test. The test was performed in

the standard manner, the end point being either chest

pain, undue fatigue or dyspnea, or completion of the

required number of trips. Full 12 lead electrocardio-

grams were obtained immediately and at one, three,

five and eight minutes after exercise. Segmental R-ST

depression of greater than or equal to 0.5 mm occur-

ring in 50 per cent of recorded complexes in any lead

was considered a positive response. T wave changes

alone were not considered as positive responses.

Postexercise S-T segment elevation, conduction de-

fects or sustained arrhythmias were not observed.

Catheterization

Data. All subjects underwent right

and left heart catheterization

with selective coronary

tine arteriography and left ventriculography.

Hemody-

namic parameters were measured in a standard man-

ner using Statham P23DB strain gauges and a Sanborn 530 photographic recorder. To exclude clearly identifiable cardiomyopathy with chest pain, patients whose left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was greater than 15 mm Hg, or who had an abnormally large left ventricle (end-diastolic volume greater than 120 ml/m’) or a reduced ejection fraction (less than 0.50) were not included.
Arteriography was performed by the Sones technic utilizing either GE or Siemens x-ray image intensification systems (9 to 6 inch dual field) and recording on 16 mm film. Multiple projections of both coronary arteries were obtained. At least two members of the staff reviewed these films and agreed as to the normality of the coronary circulation. Isolated, minor (less than or equal to 10 per cent of lumen) irregularities in the vessel lumen were no cause for exclusion.
A left ventriculogram was obtained in the right anterior oblique projection (30 degrees) in all subjects. Coronary Circulatory Studies. A catheter was placed in the coronary sinus, and paired arterial-coronary sinus blood samples were analyzed for lactate concentration in 100 subjects. In all subjects samples were obtained at rest and during isoproterenol infusion (2 to 6 pg/min, 88 subjects) or during atrial pacing up to rates of 150 beats/min (12 subjects). Lactate concentrations were determined in duplicate by a slight modification of the method of Horn and Bruns previously reported from this laboratory [i’]. An extraction coefficient (F) was calculated

preted as an ischemic response. Coronary blood flow

was measured by the inert radioactive gas technic uti-

lizing either *5Kr or ‘33Xe [8]. Flows were obtained in

18 subjects at rest and in six subjects during isopro-

terenol infusion (2 to 6 pg/min). Paired arterial-coro-

nary sinus blood samples obtained simultaneously

were analyzed for oxygen content by the manometric

technic. Oxygen extraction (F) was calculated

Follow-up Data. Subjects who failed to respond to mailed questionnaires were interviewed by telephone. When patients or their immediate families could not be contacted, follow-up data were sought from their referring physicians. In addition, these physicians were contacted to establish causes of death or to verify reports of prolonged hospitalization for chest pain.

cent of the subjects in group 2 also had occasional but unpredictable precipitation of pain by exerd tion. A relatively high proportion had a history of pain at rest without known precipitating cause. Two-thirds of the subjects whose pain was predominantly related to exertion (group 1) obtained rapid relief after taking nitroglycerin sublingually. Thirty-nine per cent of the patients were smokers and 22 per cent had hypertension; there were no significant differences between the groups. Predisposing Metabolic Factors to Coronary Heart Disease (Table II). Carbohydrate intolerance, as defined by an abnormal fasting plasma glucose level or by the intravenous glucose tolerance !est, was present in 23 of 55 subjects tested (42 per cent) in group 1 and in 27 of 59 tested (46 per cent) in group 2. Overt diabetes was present in only one subject. Abnormalities of lipid metabolism, either triglyceride or chblesterol, were present in 56 of 191 subjects tested in both groups. Extracardiac Source of Pain (Table 111). Of the 13 subjects with abnormalities of the gallbladder, two had stones and underwent cholecystectomy. Neither experienced significant relief of pain. Cervical laminectomy in one patient with severe disc disease effected no relief of the pain syndrome. Findings in other patients were not considered severe enough to explain the pain or to justify spe-

cific therapeutic measures. Medical management

wa: applied to all 11 subjects with small slidit7g

hernias, but none was relieved of pain. Other ab-

normal findings, such as duodenal scarring, were

minor in degree.

Electrocardiogram

(Table IV). Some abnormality

in the electrocardiogram

was noted in slightly over

half the subjects, the most frequent being non-

specific changes in the S-T segment and T waves.

Patterns considered diagnostic of prior trans-

mural myocardial infarction were present in four

subjects, two ir! each subgroup. These were even-

ly divided between patterns of anterior and inferior

infarction. No clear differentiation

in the electro-

cardiogram could be made between subjects with

and without pain predominantly

related to exer-

tion. The electrocardiogram

was further analyzed

on the basis of sex; it was normal at rest in 41 of

99 women and in 56 of 101 men. The frequency

of nonspecific S-T segment and T wave abnor-

malities was significantly higher in women than in

men (p less than 0.01).

Postexercise Electrocardiogram

(Table V). Thirty-

one (20 per cent) of 152 Master double 2-step

tests were positive; 10 of 64 in group 1 and’21 of 86

in group 2. The difference between the two groups

was not significantly different. Of the total group

with normal resting electrocardiograms

14 per

cent showed segmental R-ST depression after

exercise.

Analysis of these data on the basis of sex re-

vealed that 11 per cent of the men and 34 per

cent of the women in both groups had a positive

response to exercise. Further, only one man with

a normal control electrocardiogram

had a positive

response to exercise, so that seven of the eight

positive responses in men occurred in the pres-

ence of an abnormal resting electrocardiogram.

This differed from the female patients in whom

nearly half of the positive responses (11 of 23)

occurred in subjects with normal control tracings.

Myocardial Lactate Metabolism (Table VI). Ap-

proximately 20 per cent of the subjects in groups

1 and 2 had metabolic evidence of ischemia dur-

ing stress, without significant difference between

the two groups. Of 51 female patients, 16 (31 per

cent) had an abnormal response. Of 49 male pa-

tients, only 6 (12 per cent) had an abnormal re-

sponse.

Coronary Hemodynamics.

Coronary blood flow at

rest was 101 f 22 ml/100 g/min. In six subjects

receiving isoproterenol

infusion, coronary flow

was 140 f 25 ml/100 g/min. Oxygen extraction

cent during isoproterenol

subjects. Coronary sinus oxygen content was 5.8

f 1.6 volumes per cent at rest. This value was

7.0 f .64 volumes per cent in eight subjects

studied during isoproterenol infusion. These data

do not differ significantly from those found in nor-

mal subjects [9].

Correlative

Data.

We attempted to correlate

predisposing factors to atherosclerosis

with meta-

bolic or electrocardiographic

evidence for myo-

cardial ischemia. Of 200 subjects 50 showed an

abnormality in either the postexercise electrocar-

diogram or in myocardial lactate metabolism.

Eleven of the 47 subjects with an abnormal intra-

venous glucose tolerance test and 12 of 57

subjects with lipid metabolic abnormalities

had

evidence of ischemia. Therefore, no specific rela-

tionship was seen. Of 50 patients with evidence of

ischemia, 7 had a lipid disorder and 11 carbohy-

drate intolerance. These proportions are the same

as the prevalence of the metabolic disorders in

the study groups as a whole.

Effect of Antianginal Agents (Table VII). The his-

tory of the effect of nitroglycerin administration,

which was obtained at the time of admission for

cardiac catheterization,

has been presented ear-

lier for both groups (Table I). The data obtained

by questionnaire at the end of the study period

(summer, 1971) was very similar: slightly more

than 50 per cent reported prompt diminution in

pain after taking nitroglycerin (Table VI I).

Of 50 patients who received propranolol and

were sampled by questionnaire at the end of the

study, 30 (60 per cent) reported some diminution

in the frequency and severity of pain. A somewhat

greater proportion of patients with exertional pain

(group 1) obtained relief as compared to patients

with predominantly

nonexertional

pain (group 2)

(Table VI I). However, when a subgroup of these

patients was subjected to a more rigorous drug-

response evaluation using personal physician in-

terviews and double-blind technics, only 6 of the

26 subjects (23 per cent) were adjudged to have

obtained prolonged improvement.

Methods and

results of this trial, and comparison with subjects

with coronary artery disease have been reported

in detail elsewhere [lo].

Follow-up Data (Table VII). Follow-up data were

obtained on all 200 patients during a six year peri-

od (mean duration three years). About 40 per

cent of the total group had mainly exertional chest

pain at the time of first evaluation. Of the six

deaths, two were due to noncoronary

causes

and four were from unknown causes. One of

these four patients had a history of idiopathic ven-

tricular tachycardia. In anothe) one of the four an

autopsy was performed in a small New England

community hospital. The heart was normal on

both gross and microscopic examination, and the

official cause of death was undetermined.

Life table analysis (Figure 1) indicates that lon-

gevity in these patients is similar to the population

at large [ll]. The benign nature of the disease in

the surviving patients is also illustrated in Table

VII. Less than half the subjects required medica-

tion, and very few patients complained of worsen-

ing symptoms. There were 19 hospitalizations

for

chest pain, none of which culminated in a proved

myocardial infarction. In one patient congestive

heart failure developed and a diagnosis of idio-

pathic cardiomyopathy

was subsequently made.

COMMENTS

A syndrome of ch.est pain in the absence of major

coronary arterial obstruction has been observed

over a six year period. In contrast to other studies

[!!I], this syndrome occurred with equal frequency

in men and women. Coronary heart disease is fre-

quently suspected not only because of the history,

but also because of an abnormal resting electro-

cardiogram. The latter, of course, may be a factor

in the preselection of patients for study, since a

patient with chest pain and an abnormal resting

electrocardiogram

is more likely to be referred for

catheterization

and angiography than is a patient

with a normal electrocardiogram.

When a Mas-

ter’s double 2-step test was performed, 20 per

cent showed an ischemic electrocardiographic

re-

sponse. Metabolic disorders predisposing to ath-

erosclerosis were present, but the prevalence was

much lower than in subjects with proved coronary

heart disease [12]. Because patients with abnor-

mal hemodynamics were excluded, the symptoms

could not be explained on this basis. Coronary

physiology, as determined by measurements

of

coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen ex-

traction were normal. On the other hand, lactate

utilization by the myocardium was abnormal in ap-

proximately

20 per cent of the total group,

suggesting that cellular hypoxia may develop dur-

ing certain stressful states, such as isoproterenol

infusion or pacing induced tachycardia. The oc-

currence of ischemic electrocardiographic

re-

sponses to exercise and lactate production by the

heart during stress strongly support the view that

the pain is of cardiac origin, at least in those pa-

tients who have such abnormalities. No pathologic

correlation is as yet available, however. No spe-

cific historic features [13] or evidence concerning

sources of noncardiac pain [14] could differen-

tiate these patients from patients with coronary

heart disease. Interestingly, objective evidence of

myocardial ischemia was found three times more

frequently in women than in men. The explanation

for this observation is not known. The most accu-

rate diagnostic approach has been a multifactorial

one, as reported recently from this laboratory

[ISI.
Management

of these patients is difficult. Of 87

patients taking nitroglycerin 41 responded prompt-

ly to this drug or to one of the longer acting ni-

trate compounds, and 30 of 50 patients showed a

favorable response to beta adrenergic blocking

agents. When an apparent emotional component

was present, we encouraged patients to be eval-

uated with possible long-term psychotherapy

in

mind. Although hard to analyze objectively, our

impression is that beneficial results have only

rarely been obtained.

Long-term follow-up with or without specific

medical management, however, has been encour-

aging. About half of the patients obtained relief of

pain over several years, and in only 8 per cent did

the pain syndrome worsen. No myocardial infarc-

tions have been documented during the follow-up

period, although four patients had had a clear cut

infarction prior to study.

As noted by others [11,16], and confirmed in

the present study, mortality is not increased over

that of the population at large when matched for

sex and age. Four patients died suddenly; autopsy

in one revealed an essentially normal heart.

The question of the underlying etiology of this

syndrome requires further consideration.

The

major hypotheses are as follows:

(1) Psychosomatic etiology. Some investigators

believe that normal coronary arteriograms associ-

ated with a normal left ventriculogram

and left

ventricular pressures rule out organic heart dis-

ease. They contend that the chest pain in such

patients, therefore, is psychosomatic

in origin.

The occurrence of electrocardiographic

abnor-

malities at rest as well as after exercise, and the

metabolic evidence of ischemia cited and re-

ported by others [17], are, however, left unex-

plained by the psychosomatic theory. At least two

reasons make it difficult to assess this hypothesis:

(1) the obvious difficulty of scientifically quantify-

ing psychiatric disease and (2) the high incidence

740

June 1973 The American Journal of Medicine Volume 54

ANGINAL SYNDROME AND NORMAL CORONARY ARTERIOGRAMS-KEMP

ET AL.

of emotional disorders in patients with chronic

chest pain and proved coronary heart disease.

(2) Misinterpretation

of the arteriogram.

In a

recent editorial it was suggested that the majority

of these patients have coronary atherosclerosis

which has escaped diagnosis by the coronary ar-

teriogram [18]. This possibility has also concerned

us because the undetected lesion could easily ex-

plain the occurrence of electrocardiographic

and

metabolic evidence of ischemia. In addition, one

can postulate such lesions as “flush” occlusions

of secondary branches of the coronary arteries

that would defy proper interpretation even by the

most skillful arteriographer.

The only study direct-

ly bearing on the issue of accuracy suggests that

when coronary arteriograms

are of excellent

roentgenographic

quality, few, if any, errors are

made in interpretation

[19]. This may be partly

due to the nature of the disease process. “Flush”

occlusions of single vessels are rarely found at

necropsy without ample evidence of atherosclero-

sis elsewhere in the coronary circulation or of

local collateral vessels filling a distal segment.

Furthermore, the finding of a single occluded sec-

ondary branch of a coronary artery at postmortem

is only rarely associated with antemortem symp-

toms. Finally, five patients in this study underwent

coronary arteriography at widely separated inter-

vals in time. No lesions of the coronary arteries

were identified at subsequent study.

Coronary atherosclerosis

is usually progressive

relative to morbidity and mortality, and athero-

sclerosis is cumulative as a function of time [20].

The clinical course of this syndrome therefore

virtually excludes the possibility of these patients

having unrecognized

coronary atherosclerosis.

The gradual resolution of the pain syndrome

over several years in the majority of patients and

the benign prognosis speak strongly against this

explanation accounting for anything but a rare pa-

tient. Nevertheless, it must be kept constantly in

mind, particularly when the arteriograms are not

of the highest roentgenographic

quality.

(3) Defect of oxyhemoglobin dissociation. In a

recent report, Eliot and Bratt [21] showed signifi-

cant rightward shifts of oxyhemoglobin

dissocia-

tion curves at rest in 14 of 15 women with find-

ings consistent with myocardial ischemia and nor-

mal coronary arteriograms.

They suggested that

this abnormality may play a causative role in this

condition. This type of defect, however, would

cause oxygen to be more dissociated from hemo-

globin at the same saturation and pH, i.e., hemo-

globin would have a lower affinity for oxygen, thus

releasing it to the tissues more readily. Hemoglo-

bin affinity for oxygen was examined in 19 pa-

tients in this series and was found to be normal

[22]. In addition, this theory is unappealing be-

cause the normal regulatory mechanisms can

augment coronary blood flow many fold to provide

adequate oxygen in states with reduced arterial

oxyhemoglobins

such as anemia and arterial

hypoxemia [23]. Further, if a defect in hemoglobin

oxygen dissociation were the cause of oxygen de-

privation, one would expect to find high resting

coronary blood flow, low oxygen extraction and

high coronary venous oxygen content, whereas

our data indicate that these parameters are nor-

mal. On balance, abnormalities of oxyhemoglobin

dissociation appear to be an unlikely explanation

for this syndrome.

(4) Disease of the small vessels of the myocar-

dium. Attention has been directed recently toward

disease that can occur in coronary arteries that

are between 0.1 and 1.0 mm in diameter [24].

Disease of such small vessels is not readily iden-

tified by the technic of coronary tine arteriogra-

phy. Diffuse obstructive disease at this level could

account for regional ischemia and in every way

simulate obstruction

of the major coronary

branches. Because each individual obstructed ar-

tery supplies relatively little myocardium, the be-

nign nature of the clinical course might be ac-

counted for. James [24] has pointed out, however,

that the clinical course of patients with proved

small vessel disease is characterized by a high in-

cidence of conduction disturbances and arrhyth-

mias. Although a few such abnormalities

were

present in our patients, chest pain and not ar-

rhythmias dominated the clinical picture. In this

study two patients had rheumatoid arthritis, and a

third had arthritis of unknown etiology. Rheuma-

toid arthritis may involve the small vessels of the

myocardium. Three other patients in our series

complained of pain and blanching of the finger

tips on exposure to cold, but none had objective

evidence of tissue necrosis. No supporting data

for scleroderma, lupus erythematosus or polyarte-

ritis could be accrued. Two other instances of

systemic disease occurred in our study group:

fibromuscular hyperplasia of the external iliac ar-

teries bilaterally and ulcerative colitis.

(5) Spasm of the coronary arteries. Soon after

the advent of coronary arteriography,

it was ap-

preciated that intense, localized vasoconstriction

of the major coronary arteries could be seen ei-

ther at the catheter tip or a few centimeters distal

to it, apparently induced mechanically.

Spasm

could be completely relieved by nitroglycerin. The

angiographic picture is quite striking because the

lumen can be almost obliterated. Spasm occurs

most frequently in women and after the injection

of the right coronary artery. The patient is characteristically asymptomatic during the period in which the arterial segment is in spasm. Whether spasm ever occurs in the absence of manipulation of the coronary arteries is unknown. Nevertheless, the ability of the coronary arteries to exhibit a “functional” stenosis of profound degree demands our continued interest.
(6) Heterogeneous etiology. The syndrome may

be caused by any one of the previously mentioned etiologies. In patients who exhibit objective evidence of myocardial ischemia, the etiology might be masked coronary artery obstruction, vasculitis, coronary spasm, cardiomyopathy or an as yet unidentified defect in myocardial metabolism. In patients without ischemic changes, the cause may be either emotional or due to an as yet unidentified extra cardiac factor.
