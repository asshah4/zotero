Abstract: Due to the sparse data on the repeatability of short and ultra-short term heart rate variability (HRV) measures, we measured the repeatability of common HRV measures derived from 10-second, 2-minute, and 6-minute recordings in 63 healthy men and women, aged 45-64, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Three 10-second and 2 six-minute heart rate recordings were obtained during each of 2 visits, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. We partitioned the measurement error into components and computed intraclass correlation coefﬁcients using nested, random effects models. Repeatability improved with the length of recording: intraclass correlation coefﬁcients were greater than 0.7 for 6-minute measures and 2-minute time domain measures and greater than 0.5 for 2-minute frequency domain measures. Repeatability of measures from 10-second records was lower, but improved considerably when the mean from 2 or 3 records was used. Correlations between the same measures from different length recordings were quite high. Our ﬁndings support the use of records of at least 5 minutes in length in epidemiological studies, in accordance with previous guidelines. Researchers using 10-second records should consider taking the mean of several recordings, when possible, or using statistical methods to correct for measurement error. Key words: Autonomic nervous system, heart rate variability, reliability, repeatability.

The measurement of heart rate variability (HRV), the oscillation in the interval between consecutive heart beats, is an established, noninvasive and quantitative method of assessing cardiac autonomic activity. Experiments in animals and humans have characterized many of the physiological phenomena underlying various HRV measures. Epidemiologic studies have described some of the population correlates of these measures and have demonstrated that low HRV predicts post-myocardial infarction mortality (1–5), incident coronary heart disease (6 – 8), incident hypertension (9,10), and all cause mortality (11–13).
Historically, HRV has been measured using both 24-hour Holter recordings and shorter recordings, most commonly between 2- and 15-minutes in

length. While there were initially questions about the accuracy of these shorter recordings, it is now recognized that HRV from records of 2- to 5-minute duration can be used to accurately assess cardiac autonomic activity (14). Furthermore, there has been interest in using ultra-short recordings from the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to capture time domain measures of HRV. These records are ten seconds in duration and much easier to collect in clinical and epidemiologic settings (8,11,12).
However, the ability to make full use of HRV measures derived from both short and ultra-short term recordings is limited by the sparse data on the short-term repeatability of these measures in healthy populations (15–19). To determine the repeatability of common HRV measures derived from 10-second, 2-minute, and 6-minute recordings, we conducted a repeatability study among 63 apparently healthy, middle-aged men and women.
Materials and Methods
Data Collection and Processing
We recruited 63 participants aged 45 to 64 years from the Chapel Hill, North Carolina area. We made efforts to match the age, gender, and racial characteristics of the volunteer group to that of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study cohort at baseline (20), and excluded volunteers if they were or may have been pregnant; if they had diagnosed diabetes, congestive heart failure, or acute or chronic renal disease; if they had a pacemaker; or if they were currently taking type 1A antiarrhythmics (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, or moricizine). All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board.
We examined participants in the General Clinical Research Center at the University of North Carolina Hospitals between July and October 2001. Participants attended 2 visits, each approximately 60 minutes long, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. We asked participants to avoid caffeine, eating, heavy physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake for the 10 hours preceding each clinic visit. We identiﬁed individuals who had not been fasting for 10 hours or who had smoked in the morning, but did not exclude protocol violators from participating in the study.
Four trained and certiﬁed technicians examined

participants following a standardized protocol. Conditions were similar to those in the ARIC study (20 –22). All examinations took place between 7:30 and 11:30 am in examination rooms maintained at a comfortable temperature with limited distractions. We described experimental procedures to participants in advance, and asked them to lie quietly before and during each recording.
After participants rested for 15 minutes in the supine position, we recorded two 10-second, standard twelve-lead resting ECGs using Kendall QTrace 5400 Ag/AgCl electrodes (Ludlow Co., Chicopee, MA) positioned using the E-V6 Halfpoint method (23). We then obtained one 10-second, 12-lead ECG with electrodes in the Mason-Likar position (24), and two 3-lead, 6-minute continuous recordings of R-R intervals, using the V1, V6, and RL electrodes. During the 6-minute recordings, we automatically measured blood pressure every minute using the Critikon Dinamap 8100T vital signs monitor (Critikon, Tampa FL).
We used the MAC PC Personal Cardiograph (Marquette Electronics, Inc., Jupiter, FL) to record digitized twelve-lead ECGs, which were sent via modem to the Epidemiological Cardiology Research (EPICARE) Center (Winston-Salem, NC) where they were computer coded and processed using the most recent version of the Marquette GE program version 12SL to generate the following measures: the mean heart rate across all 12 leads (HR [beats/ min]); mean R-R interval duration (RR [ms]), which was the unit-corrected inverse of the mean heart rate; the standard deviation of all normal-tonormal R-R intervals (SDNN [ms]); and the root mean square of successive differences between all normal-to-normal R-R intervals (rMSSD [ms]). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we limited the analyses of the 10-second records to those collected with the electrodes in the standard position.
While the Marquette GE program could process the 10-second records in a completely automated manner, the program for the collection and processing of the 6-minute records required human identiﬁcation of artifacts. We gave each record an identiﬁcation number so the 2 trained readers could not determine which records came from the same participant. Reader 1 read all 252 records once, and reread a random subset of 126 records. Reader 2 read a random subset of 63 of the 126 records twice.
We used a dedicated desktop computer and software (Arrhythmia Research Technology (ART), Inc., Austin, TX) for continuous detection of R waves at a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz. The R waves were stored in electronic ﬁles and sent to the Ultrasound Reading Center (Winston-Salem, NC)

Repeatability of HRV Measures • Schroeder et al. 165

for data processing. Stored R-R intervals were converted into beat-to-beat heart rate data. At the reading center, readers used a modiﬁed version of the ART software to access, extract, and apply an artifact identiﬁcation and imputation system to the stored ﬁles. The readers used a ﬁlter program that graphically displays a plot of beat-to-beat heart rate over time to identify and ﬂag any visually apparent artifacts in the heart rate record. Data ﬁles were converted to binary format and transferred to a dedicated computer with specialized software (PREDICTOR II HRVECG, Arrhythmia Research Technology, Inc., Austin, TX) for data processing and spectrum analysis. The PREDICTOR II software uses a variance preserving imputation algorithm for estimating power components in the presence of artifacts. After interpolation, heart rate data were converted back to R-R intervals for computation of time domain measures and power spectral analysis, which includes time trend analysis, fast Fourier transformation, smoothing, and computation of frequency and time domain measures.
The 2-minute records were a subset of the 6-minute records, created by truncating the 6-minute records after the ﬁrst 2 minutes. This truncation occurred prior to the artifact identiﬁcation step. The processing of the 2-minute records then continued as described above for the 6-minute records. Further details of the processing of the 2-minute and 6-minute records have been previously published (25,26).
The calculated time domain measures included: RR, HR, SDNN, and rMSSD. For the 2- and 6-minute records, HR was the unit-corrected inverse of the mean R-R interval duration. The frequency domain measures were generated through fast Fourier transformation of the edited R-R interval records, which produces a power spectral density curve, a plot of the frequency of the cyclic components of variation in R-R interval duration against the square of their amplitude. High frequency power (HF [ms2]), deﬁned as the area under the power spectral density curve from 0.15 to 0.50 Hz, is regulated by the parasympathetic system (14). Low frequency power (LF [ms2]), deﬁned as the area under the power spectral density curve from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz, is regulated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems (14). In addition, we normalized high frequency and low frequency power as follows: HFnuϭ100% ϫ HF/(HFϩLF) and LFnuϭ100% ϫ LF/(HFϩLF). Use of HFnu and LFnu minimizes the effect of changes in total power on the HF and LF values (14).
The results from 10 readings (8 two-minute readings and 2 six-minute readings, corresponding to 4

different recordings) were excluded either because of extreme noise or because the proportion of acceptable R-R intervals was less than 0.80. All remaining 2- and 6-minute records had at least 30 acceptable R-R intervals and at least 60 seconds of usable recording.
All the 10-second records had signal-to-noise ratios above a pre-speciﬁed threshold. Nine records with a Minnesota Code of 8.1 (frequent premature beats), less than ﬁve acceptable R-R intervals, or the proportion of acceptable R-R intervals less than 0.50 were excluded. According to the Minnesota Codes, no records met the criteria for second or third degree atrioventricular block, Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome, an artiﬁcial pacemaker, or atrial ﬁbrillation/ﬂutter. There were also two missing ten-second records due to temporary equipment problems.
Statistical Analysis
We used nested random effects models to estimate the between-person variance, between-visit variance, and the between- and within-reader variance (27). Details are given in Appendix A. We were primarily interested in the interclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC), which is the proportion of the between-person variance over the total variance (ICC ϭ ␴B2P/␴T2, where ␴B2P is the betweenperson variance and ␴T2 is the total variance). The ICC can also be interpreted as the correlation between different measures on the same individual, where the measures are made at different visits and read by different readers. Other correlations can be similarly deﬁned: between repeat readings by the same reader on the same recording; between repeat readings by different readers on the same recording. These correlation coefﬁcients may be expressed by RV ϭ (␴T2 Ϫ ␴V2)/␴T2, where ␴V2 is the sum of the variance components related to the type of repeatability being considered. The ICC is a special case of RV where ␴V2 ϭ ␴T2 Ϫ ␴B2P. We present the proportion of the variance due to each source of variation. The variance due to each source of variation can be calculated by multiplying each proportion by the total variance. The coefﬁcient of variation for each source can be calculated by dividing the square root of the variance associated with that source (ie, the standard deviation) by the mean of the heart rate variability measure.
Because the multiple recordings at a given visit on a given person were done by the same technician, models including a term for between-technician variance were, in general, unstable. Conse-

quently, we present models that do not include a term for the between-technician variance. All available evidence, however, indicated that the between-technician variance was negligible.
All models were implemented using the SAS MIXED procedure in SAS Version 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with the restricted maximum likelihood method. The computation of standard errors and conﬁdence intervals depends on the assumption of normal distributions for the heart rate variability measures. Consequently, variables with skewed distributions were log-transformed in order to normalize them. Because the ICC of the variable on the original scale may be of interest to readers, we also present the ICCs on the original scale. The conﬁdence intervals for these estimates, however, should be interpreted cautiously in light of the violation of the normality assumption. In addition to the normality assumption, assumptions of linearity and independence among effects are also required for these models. Similar models were also ﬁt using the mean of measures derived from two or three ten-second ECGs.
We used multivariate repeated measures mixed models to estimate correlation coefﬁcients between heart rate variability measures from different length recordings. Details of these models are given in Appendix B.
For sensitivity analyses, the above models were rerun after excluding different groups of individuals. These exclusions were performed separately, and also in various combinations. The groups included individuals who violated the fasting or smoking components of the protocol, individuals who were taking speciﬁc groups of medications (␤-antagonists, thyroid hormones, ␣- or ␤-agonists, diuretics, anticholinergics, or selective serotonin receptor inhibitors), and individuals with ﬁrst degree atrioventricular blocks (as deﬁned by a PR interval greater than 200 ms) or bundle branch

blocks (as deﬁned by a QRS interval greater than 120 ms).
Results
Of the 63 participants, 31 (49%) were female and 20 (32%) were non-white. The mean age was 52, with a range of 45 to 64 years. The mean body mass index was 27 kg/m2. The mean fasting interval for food was 13 hours and for drink was 12 hours. Six of the participants violated either the fasting or smoking protocol at one or both visits. Participants were taking a variety of medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (nϭ10), anticholinergics (nϭ5), diuretics (nϭ4), ␣- or ␤-agonists (nϭ4), thyroid hormones (nϭ3), and ␤-antagonists (nϭ1).
Arithmetic and geometric means for the heart rate variability measures are shown in Table 1. SDNN, rMSSD, HF, and LF were highly skewed and R-R interval was slightly skewed. The different magnitudes of HF and LF for the 2-minute and 6-minute records are due to a different internal scaling factor that is introduced into records of different lengths by the proprietary ART software. Statistical tests comparing the means of the ﬁrst recordings from the ﬁrst visit, the second recordings from the ﬁrst visit revealed no differences, in accordance with the assumptions underlying the subsequent statistical models.
Because ICCs are changed by logarithmic transformation, Table 2 shows the ICC for both transformed and untransformed measures. For many purposes, it is most appropriate to use the distributions that are the most normally distributed, ie, transformed values for SDNN, rMSSD, HF, and LF and untransformed values for HR, RR, HFnu and LFnu. The log-transformed values tended to have

larger ICCs than the untransformed values for the 10-second records, and smaller ICCs for the 2-minute and 6-minute records.
While the ICCs for HR and RR were greater than 0.80 for the 10-second records, the time domain measures SDNN and rMSSD had substantially lower ICCs (Table 3). For the 2-minute and 6-minute records, the time domain measures had ICCs greater than or equal to 0.70, with little difference between 2-minute and 6-minute records. In contrast, there was substantial improvement in the repeatability of low frequency power from using 6-minute instead of 2-minute records.
Because of the comparatively low ICC values for

some of measures from the 10-second records, we investigated the effect of using the average values from 2 or 3 ten-second recordings, as is frequently done in epidemiologic studies for blood pressure. The ICCs for the time domain measures were substantially improved (Table 3). Using 3 recordings increased the ICC for log-transformed SDNN from 0.46 to 0.65 and for log-transformed rMSSD from 0.57 to 0.74.
For the 2-minute and 6-minute records, the measurement error was partitioned into several components (Table 4). Note that the ﬁrst line in the Table shows the proportion of the total variance that is due to the between-person component,

The variances and the coefﬁcients of variation due to each source of variation can be easily calculated from the information presented here. The variance due to each source of variation is calculated by multiplying each proportion by the total variance. The coefﬁcient of variation is calculated by dividing the square root of the variance associated with that source (ie, the standard deviation) by the mean of the heart rate variability measure (given in Table 1).

which is the ICC. For many of the measures, the between-visit variance component is smaller than the within-visit variance component, which suggests that most of the within-person variance is due to the variability between different recordings. The added variability that comes from comparing 2 recordings from different visits versus comparing two recordings from the same visit is often small. For all of the HRV measures, the between- and within-reader components were quite small.
The correlations between the same measure from different length recordings were generally quite high, with slightly lower correlations seen comparing ten-second SDNN to two-minute, and sixminute SDNN, and for measures involving low frequency power (LF, HFnu, and LFnu) (Table 5).

In general our ﬁndings were not appreciably changed by excluding individuals who violated the fasting or smoking components of the protocol, individuals who were taking speciﬁc groups of medications, or individuals with bundle branch blocks. Excluding 9 individuals with ﬁrst degree atrioventricular blocks, however, decreased the repeatability of most of the measures.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to determine the repeatability of heart rate variability measures from the standard 10-second, 12-lead

ECG. While we found low repeatability, as assessed by the intraclass correlation coefﬁcient, taking the mean values from 3 ten-second recordings from the same recording session resulted in repeatability that compares well with that from longer records. We found that the repeatability of heart rate variability measures derived from records 2- and 6-minutes in duration was quite high, with the possible exception of low frequency power from two-minute records. Thus, records of 2-minute duration appear sufﬁcient to obtain estimates of time domain measures and high frequency power that are repeatable and highly correlated with their 6-minute counterparts.
There has been only one previous study that investigated the measurement error of heart rate variability from ultra-short recordings (16). Our intraclass correlation coefﬁcients for 10-second records are remarkably similar to those found by Dekker for 20-second records (16). Information about the measurement error of short-term (5minute) heart rate variability recordings is also sparse. Previous studies have attempted to study the measurement error of short-term heart rate variability recordings using different measurement protocols and different statistics. Some studies were restricted to special populations, such as patients undergoing knee replacement (28) or patients with chronic heart failure (17,29), or were measured using very different equipment (30 –32) or with controlled breathing (33–35), and thus are not strictly pertinent to this study, in which heart rate variability was measured in a presumably healthy group of middle aged adults under conditions of spontaneous breathing. Three of the 4 studies performed on healthy adults with spontaneous breathing were quite small, with samples sizes between 14 and 18 (15,16,19), while the fourth study included 70 healthy, adult residents of Israeli kibbutzim (18). In general, our intraclass correlation coefﬁcients for 6-minute records tend to be higher than those for 5-minute records as reported by Pitzalis (19) and Dekker (16), and comparable to those found by Ahmed (15) and Sinnreich (18). A recent study computed the repeatability of 3-minute measures using 36 older adults, with a mix of healthy and diabetic subjects, and found lower repeatability than that of our 2-minute measures (36).
In general, the ICC values that we found for 2and 6-minute measures and for the mean of three 10-second measures compares favorably with those found for other commonly used measurements in the ARIC study. For example, unpublished results from 190 ARIC participants with repeat measurements 1 to 2 weeks apart gave ICCs of 0.75 for

systolic blood pressure and 0.62 for diastolic blood pressure when using the average of the second and third blood pressure measurements.
The correlation coefﬁcients that we report between 10-second and 6-minute measures are very similar to the Spearman correlation coefﬁcients that Dekker computed between 20-second and 5-minute records (0.96 for HR, 0.48 for SDNN, and 0.73 for rMSSD) (16). Our correlations between 2and 6-minute measures are similar to those that Marks reported for 2.5- and 5-minute records under controlled breathing (0.99 for HR, 0.98-0.99 for RR, 0.99 for SDNN, 0.53-0.67 for LF, and 0.71-0.72 for HF) (34).
This study also partitioned the measurement variance into several different components, thus shedding light on potentially important sources of error. It must be noted that this study used very standardized collection and processing procedures which minimize measurement error. We were able to recruit a middle-aged study population that was approximately half female and half minority, which should facilitate extrapolation to other population groups. However, about half of our sample had mean heart rates less than 60 beats/min, which may limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings. Furthermore, caution should be used when extrapolating these results to hospitalized or patient populations, or to clinical settings in which similar attention is not given to minimizing measurement error.
Because of the design of the study, it was impossible to fully separate the inter-technician variance component, although available evidence suggests that this variance component was quite negligible. The durations that we studied, 10-seconds, 2-minutes, and 6-minutes, correspond to the duration of extant records from the ARIC study, and were chosen in order to permit application of these estimates to the ARIC study. Due to resource constraints, we were unable to examine 5-minute records, which is the standard currently recommended by the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (14). Based on the data we have presented for 2-minute and 6-minute records; however, it should be possible to approximate values for 5-minute records.
The information we present on the repeatability of heart rate variability measures derived from short and ultra-short term records should be of value to researchers planning future studies of heart rate variability. We recommend using records at least 5-minutes in duration, when possible, in accordance with the previous guidelines (14). In

large scale epidemiologic studies where longer records are unavailable, it may be possible to use time domain measures derived from a single 10second recording. However, researchers using 10second records should consider taking the mean of several recordings. If only a single recording is available, researchers should strongly consider statistical methods to adjust for the considerable measurement error (37–39).

Appendix A

We applied the following random effects model to the two-minute and six-minute heart rate variability measures (27):

Yijklm ϭ ␮ ϩ PERSONi ϩ VISITj͑PERSONi͒
ϩ RECORDk͑PERSONi, VISITj͒
ϩ READERl͑PERSONi, VISITj, RECORDk͒
ϩ ERRORijklm
where Yijklm ϭ heart rate variability measures and ␮ is the intercept. The terms in the model are assumed independent. From this model one can write the total variance as:

Var͑Yijklm͒

ϭ

␴2 TOTAL(T)

ϭ ␴B2P ϩ ␴B2 V ϩ ␴W 2 V ϩ ␴B2 R ϩ ␴W2 R
␴B2P is the between-person variation and ␴B2V is the between-visit variation. ␴W 2 V is the within-visit variation, which comes from different recordings taken
at the same visit on the same person by the same technician. ␴B2R is the between-reader variation and ␴W 2 R is the within-reader variation, from the error term. Thus ␴T2 Ϫ ␴B2P is the total measurement variance, where ␴T2 is the total of all the variance components.
Because the reading process is completely auto-
mated for the ten-second records, a simpler model was used: Yijk ϭ ␮ ϩ PERSONi ϩ VISITj(PERSONi) ϩ ERRORijk. The total variance for the ten-second records is thus: Var(Yijk) ϭ ␴T2OTAL(T) ϭ ␴B2P ϩ ␴B2V ϩ ␴W 2 V.

Appendix B
A multivariate repeated measures model was used to compute correlations between different heart rate variability measures, assuming distinct means and variances for measurements from different length recordings. To compute the correlation coefﬁcient between a heart rate variability measure from a 10-second recording and the same measure from a 6-minute recording, we used a vector of 8 measurements, in the following order: ﬁrst 10second recording from the ﬁrst visit, second 10second recording from the ﬁrst visit, ﬁrst 10-second recording from the second visit, second 10-second recording from the second visit, ﬁrst 6-minute recording from the ﬁrst visit, second 6-minute recording from the ﬁrst visit, ﬁrst 6-minute record-

ing from the second visit, and the second 6-minute recording from the second visit. This vector was assumed to have a covariance matrix ⌺, with the following structure:

This covariance matrix has 8 parameters, and
contains the following assumptions: the variance of
all the 10-second measures is the same, and equals ␴12 ; the variance of all the 6-minute measures is the same, and equals ␴22 ; the covariance between the 2 different 10-second measures at a given visit is ␴21; the covariance between the 2 different 6-minute measures at a given visit is ␴43; the covariance between any given 10-second measure and any

given 6-minute measure at the same visit is ␴31; the covariance between any given 10-second measure at one visit and any given 10-second measure at the other visit is ␴51; the covariance between any given 6-minute measure at one visit and any given 6-minute measure at the other visit is ␴73; and the covariance between any given 10-second measure at 1 visit and any given 6-minute measure at the other visit is ␴71. Analogous models were used to compare measurements from 10-second and 2-minute recordings, and from 2-minute and 6-minute recordings.
An important assumption for the above model is that the means of the measures do not vary by visit and by order within visit. In order to test this assumption, repeated measures mixed models were ﬁt with a ﬁxed effect term for the visit, recording combination (with 4 levels). The F test for the ﬁxed effect term was used to test for inequality of means. In all cases, the P value was extremely high, and did not support the hypothesis that any of the means are unequal.
