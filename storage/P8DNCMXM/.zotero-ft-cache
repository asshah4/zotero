Language is a uniquely human trait likely to have been a prerequisite for the development of human culture. The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as ﬁne control of the larynx and mouth1, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the ﬁrst gene relevant to the human ability to develop language2. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difﬁculties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment3. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspeciﬁc variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in aminoacid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.
FOXP2 (forkhead box P2) is located on human chromosome 7q31, and its major splice form encodes a protein of 715 amino acids belonging to the forkhead class of transcription factors2. It contains a glutamine-rich region consisting of two adjacent polyglutamine tracts, encoded by mixtures of CAG and CAA repeats. Such repeats are known to have elevated mutation rates. In the case of FOXP2, the lengths of the polyglutamine stretches differed for all taxa studied. Variation in the second polyglutamine tract has been observed in a small family affected with speech and language impairment, but this did not co-segregate with disorder, suggesting that minor changes in length may not signiﬁcantly alter the function of the protein4. If the polyglutamine stretches are disregarded, the human FOXP2 protein differs at only three amino-acid positions from its orthologue in the mouse (Fig. 1). When compared with a collection of 1,880 human–rodent gene pairs5, FOXP2 is among the 5% most-conserved proteins. The chimpanzee, gorilla and rhesus macaque FOXP2 proteins are all identical to each other and carry only one difference from the mouse and two differences from the human protein, whereas the orang-utan carries two differences from the mouse and three from humans (Fig. 1). Thus, although the FOXP2 protein is highly conserved, two of the three amino-acid differences between humans and mice occurred on the human lineage after the separation from the common ancestor with the chimpanzee. These two amino-acid differences are both found in exon 7 of the FOXP2 gene and are a threonine-to-asparagine and an asparagine-to-serine change at positions 303 and 325, respectively. Figure 2 shows the amino-acid changes, as well as the silent changes, mapped to a phylogeny of the relevant primates.

Once the print version (identical to the AOP) is published, the citation becomes “Author(s) Nature volume, page (year); advance online publication, 14 August 2002 (doi:10.1038/nature01025)”.

We compared the FOXP2 protein structures predicted by a variety of methods6 for humans, chimpanzees, orang-utans and mice. Whereas the chimpanzee and mouse structures were essentially identical and the orang-utan showed only a minor change in secondary structure, the human-speciﬁc change at position 325 creates a potential target site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C together with a minor change in predicted secondary structure. Several studies have shown that phosphorylation of forkhead transcription factors can be an important mechanism mediating transcriptional regulation7,8. Thus, although the FOXP2 protein is extremely conserved among mammals, it acquired two amino-acid changes on the human lineage, at least one of which may have functional consequences. This is an intriguing ﬁnding, because FOXP2 is the ﬁrst gene known to be involved in the development of speech and language.
To investigate whether the amino acids encoded in exon 7 are polymorphic in humans, we sequenced this exon from 44 human chromosomes originating from all major continents. In no case was any amino-acid polymorphism found. Further, a study that analysed the complete coding region of FOXP2 in 91 unrelated individuals of mainly European descent found no amino-acid replacements except for one case of an insertion of two glutamine codons in the second polyglutamine stretch4. Because the two amino-acid variants speciﬁc to humans occur in 226 human chromosomes, this suggests that they are ﬁxed among humans.
The evolutionary lineages leading to humans and mice diverged about 70 million years (Myr) ago9,10. Thus, during the roughly 130 Myr of evolution that separate the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees from the mouse, a single amino-acid change occurred in the FOXP2 protein. By contrast, since the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged about 4.6–6.2 Myr ago11, two ﬁxed amino-acid changes occurred on the human lineage whereas none occurred on the chimpanzee and the other primate lineages, except for one change on the orang-utan lineage. We used a likelihood ratio12 to test for constancy of the ratio of amino-acid replacements over nucleotide changes that do not cause amino-acid changes among the evolutionary lineages in Fig. 2. Whereas a signiﬁcant increase in this ratio was observed on the human lineage (P , 0.001), no such increase was seen on any other lineage. This ﬁnding is consistent with the action of positive selection on aminoacid changes in the human lineage. However, the alternative hypothesis of a relaxation of constraints on FOXP2 speciﬁc to the human lineage cannot be excluded on the basis of these data alone.
If these two changes in amino-acid encoding (or some other feature of the human FOXP2 gene) were positively selected recently during human evolution, traces of a selective sweep should be detectable in the pattern of variation found among humans13,14. To investigate this possibility, we sequenced a segment of 14,063 base pairs (bp) covering introns 4, 5 and 6 of the FOXP2 gene in seven individuals from Africa, four from Europe, one from South America, ﬁve from mainland Asia and three from Australia and Papua

New Guinea. In addition, we sequenced the same segment in a chimpanzee from central Africa, a chimpanzee from western Africa and an orang-utan (Table 1). One hallmark of a recent selective sweep is that more low-frequency alleles should be observed than expected under a neutral model of a random-mating population of constant size. To test this prediction, we calculated Tajima’s D statistic15. The value is 22.20 for our sample, indicating a sharp excess of rare alleles. Under the standard neutral model outlined above, the probability of such an excess by chance is 0.002. Population growth can also lead to negative D values throughout the genome. However, the value of D at FOXP2 is unusually low compared with other loci. For example, among 313 human genes16 sequenced in a sample of 164 chromosomes, only one has a more negative value (22.25). A second prediction for a selective sweep at a recombining locus is that more derived (that is, non-ancestral) alleles at high frequency are expected than under the standard neutral model, a feature reﬂected in a negative H value17. To estimate H, we inferred the ancestral states of variable positions seen among the humans by using the chimpanzee and orang-utan DNA sequences. The H value of 212.24 deviates signiﬁcantly from the neutral expectation of zero (P ¼ 0.042) and would be even less likely by chance under a model with population growth13. The strongly negative D and H reﬂect an extreme skew in the frequency spectrum of allelic variants at FOXP2 towards rare and high-frequency alleles. Because we considered a worldwide sample of humans, population structure might contribute to the negative D value. However, this

type of sampling scheme is highly unlikely to produce a signiﬁcantly negative H value. In contrast to demographic explanations, a selective sweep affecting the FOXP2 gene can account for both aspects of the frequency spectrum. We do not observe a reduced diversity at human FOXP2 relative to its divergence from the chimpanzee, as expected under a simple selective-sweep model. However, the magnitude of the reduction in variability expected after a selective sweep depends crucially on the rate of recombination. Estimates of recombination between intronic polymorphisms taken from a study of FOXP2 (ref. 4) suggest that this region of the gene experiences rates of genetic exchange roughly ﬁve times the genome-wide average. If we assume that a selective sweep at a linked site does account for the patterns of variability recovered at FOXP2, it is noteworthy that the next gene is located 286 kilobases (kb) away from the sequenced segment. A selective sweep is not expected to lead to an excess of high-frequency derived alleles at sites that are 286 kb distant from the target of selection13,17. Thus, the best candidates for the selected sites are the two amino-acid substitutions speciﬁc to humans in exon 7.
Individuals with disruption of FOXP2 have multiple difﬁculties with both expressive and receptive aspects of language and grammar, and the nature of the core deﬁcit remains a matter of debate18– 20. Nevertheless, a predominant feature of the phenotype of affected individuals is an impairment of selection and sequencing of ﬁne orofacial movements18, an ability that is typical of humans and not present in the great apes. We speculate that some human-speciﬁc

feature of FOXP2, perhaps one or both of the amino-acid substi-

tutions in exon 7, affect a person’s ability to control orofacial

movements and thus to develop proﬁcient spoken language. If

this speculation is true, then the time when such a FOXP2 variant

became ﬁxed in the human population may be pertinent with

regard to the evolution of human language. We estimated this

time point using a likelihood approach. Under a model of a

randomly mating population of constant size, the most likely date

since the ﬁxation of the beneﬁcial allele is 0, with approximate 95%

conﬁdence intervals of 0 and 120,000 years. Our point-estimate of 0

reﬂects the fact that high-frequency alleles rapidly drift to ﬁxation,

so an excess is most likely immediately after a selective sweep.

However, if population growth soon succeeds the ﬁxation of the

advantageous allele, the rate of drift will be decreased and high-

frequency alleles may persist longer in the population. Thus, the

inclusion of population growth may push this time estimate back by

at most the time since the onset of human population growth, some

10,000–100,000 years ago21. In any case, our method suggests that

the ﬁxation occurred during the last 200,000 years of human history,

that is, concomitant with or subsequent to the emergence of

anatomically modern humans22. This is compatible with a model

in which the expansion of modern humans was driven by the

appearance of a more-proﬁcient spoken language22. However, to

establish whether FOXP2 is indeed involved in basic aspects of

human culture, the normal functions of both the human and the

chimpanzee FOXP2 proteins need to be clariﬁed.

A

Methods
Isolation of cDNA sequences For all analysed species, we ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced overlapping fragments of the FOXP2 coding region from ﬁrst-strand cDNA. Details are available in Supplementary Information.
Genomic sequencing Full details are available in Supplementary Information. In brief, we designed primers from a human bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC) sequence (accession number AC020606), PCR-ampliﬁed fragments of 6–14 kb, re-ampliﬁed 2.2-kb fragments from these products that were then sequenced with internal primers. For each individual, each nucleotide position was read from both strands. Sequence traces were manually analysed for polymorphic positions using the program Seqman of the DNAStar package (see also Supplementary Information).
Data analysis We aligned sequences with the help of the program ClustalW23 and calculated most statistics with DnaSP 3.51 (ref. 24). P values for D and H were obtained by coalescent simulations implemented for a ﬁxed number of segregating sites, and assuming no recombination. If we take into account recombination within the 14 kb, the P values decrease (for example, P , 0.01 for H and P , 1024 for D if one assumes an effective population size of 104 and a recombination rate of 5 centimorgans (cM) per Mb). Because the chimpanzee and orang-utan do not differ at any polymorphic position compared with humans, we assumed no back mutations when estimating the P value for H. The likelihood ratio tests for non-silent and silent substitutions were performed using the PAML package12 as described25 (see Supplementary Information). We predicted the structure of human, chimpanzee, mouse and orang-utan FOXP2 using the program PredictProtein (http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein/predictprotein.html)6, which includes prediction of sites of protein kinase C phosphorylation by PROSITE26. The orang-utan-

speciﬁc alanine-to-valine change at position 6 results in the prediction of a b-sheet at positions 8–10 in the orang-utan, and the human-speciﬁc change at position 325 results in the prediction of a b-sheet in positions 323–326. However, these are not reliable and may not be relevant. We used the University of California at Santa Cruz Human Genome Project Working Draft, 22 December 2001 assembly (http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu), to estimate distances to the closest genes. The middle of the sequenced region is 220 kb away from the known 5 0 end and 54 kb away from the 3 0 end of FOXP2, respectively. The next gene (supported by the cDNA sequence with GenBank accession number AF054589) is located 286 kb distant in the 3 0 direction.
Modelling the selective sweep
A summary likelihood method (compare with ref. 27) was used to estimate the time, T, since the ﬁxation of the beneﬁcial allele in the population. The polymorphism data was summarized as v H (ref. 17) and p (ref. 28). We then ran coalescent simulations of a selective sweep with recombination as in ref. 13. These simulations assume that we have polymorphism data for a neutral locus, at some distance from a selected site, and that selection acted on a newly arising variant. The likelihood of T is estimated as the proportion of n simulated data sets, where jvHobs 2 vHsimj , 1 and jpobs 2 psimj , 1 (here, n ¼ 3 £ 106 and 1 ¼ 0.2). The likelihood of T was evaluated over a grid of points spaced every 1,000 generations. We then chose the T value that maximizes the probability of obtaining the observed (v H, p) values. In addition to T, several additional parameters are in this selective sweep model: the distance to the selected site, the effective population size of humans, the strength of selection, the mutation rate and the recombination rate. It is not computationally feasible to co-estimate all of these parameters, and we proceeded by assuming that the values of most nuisance parameters are known exactly. We hypothesized that one of the substitutions on the human lineage was the selected site and used a point estimate of the population mutation rate (assuming 5 Myr to the common ancestor of a human and chimpanzee DNA sequence). We modelled uncertainty in the recombination rate per megabase by choosing the rate for each simulation from a g distribution with parameters (5, 1); the mean was set to the recombination rate estimated from two polymorphic markers in introns 2 and 16, respectively, of the FOXP2 gene4. The effective population size was taken to be 104, on the basis of estimates for other loci29. We tried three different values for the selection coefﬁcient: s ¼ 5%, 1% and 0.5%. For these parameters, an s of 1% resulted in the highest likelihoods, so we reported the results for s ¼ 1%. If we use the chi-squared approximation with one degree of freedom for the log-likelihood ratio statistic 2lnðLikðT^ Þ=LikðTÞÞ, we obtain an approximate 95% conﬁdence interval for T of [0, 4,000 generations]. However, this approximation may not be appropriate in this context. Thus, we also ran 100 simulations to examine the distribution of Tˆ when the true T is equal to our maximum likelihood estimate of T ¼ 0 (here, n ¼ 5 £ 105 and 1 ¼ 0.2). These simulations suggested an approximate 95% conﬁdence interval of [0, 6,000 generations]. We assumed a generation time of 20 years for converting T into years.
