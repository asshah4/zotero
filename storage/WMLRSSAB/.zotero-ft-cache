Bradycardia is common in critical care units. It may be transient, asymptomatic and of little consequence, or life-threatening. Bradycardia may result from abnormalities of the sinus node, atrioventricular node, or the His-Purkinje system. It may also be precipitated by drug effects or enhanced vagal tone. Proper

diagnosis is pivotal to determining prognosis and management. Temporary and permanent pacing is now readily available, markedly improving the morbidity and mortality associated with bradyarrhythmias. (Crit Care Med 2000; 28[Suppl.]:N121–N128)

B radyarrhythmias are frequently encountered in the critical care setting. They can present as incidental ﬁndings or potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Proper identiﬁcation is key to determining prognosis and management. Before the advent of pacemakers, the prognosis of certain bradyarrhythmias was dismal. Fortunately, temporary and permanent pacing is now readily available, markedly improving morbidity and mortality associated with bradyarrhythmias.
Basic Anatomy and Physiology of the Conduction System. The normal heartbeat arises from the sinoatrial (SA) node, located in the right atrium near its junction with the superior vena cava. The SA node serves as the main pacemaker of the heart under normal conditions. The blood supply to the SA node is predominantly via the SA nodal artery, a branch of the right coronary artery in ϳ60% of people and left circumﬂex coronary artery in 40% of people. The electrical impulse travels from the SA node in a radial fashion depolarizing both atria before reaching the atrioventricular (AV) node.
The AV node is located posteriorly in the right atrium adjacent to the tricuspid annulus. The anatomy of the AV junction is complex and is comprised of three regions: the transitional zone, compact AV

node, and the penetrating AV (His) bundle. The blood supply to the AV node is via the AV nodal artery, which arises from the distal right coronary artery in 90% of people and left circumﬂex coronary artery in 10% of people. As electrical impulses travel through the AV node, a normal delay occurs (which accounts for much of the P-R interval) and serves two primary purposes. First, delay within the AV node allows time for atrial contraction to effectively contribute to ventricular ﬁlling. Second, the delay limits very rapid transmission of atrial impulses to the ventricles in cases of supraventricular tachycardia. Indeed, incremental increases in the rate of atrial pacing in the Electrophysiology lab results in progressive AV nodal conduction delay before block occurs (1). This manifests itself on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) by progressive prolongation of the P-R interval before AV block.
The cardiac impulse then travels through the His bundle to the Purkinje system and the ventricular myocardium, allowing ventricular depolarization. Block at the level of the His-Purkinje system generally occurs abruptly (with no progressive AV delay) without P-R interval prolongation.
Both the SA node and AV node are richly innervated by the autonomic nervous system. The relative balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system input accounts for the resting (baseline) autonomic tone. Studies measuring effects of autonomic blockade on the conduction system have shown that, at rest, parasympathetic activity predominates at the SA node. Parasympathetic and sympathetic activity are nearly equally balanced in the AV node (2). As we shall see, an increase in para-

sympathetic output (increased vagal tone) can result in clinically signiﬁcant bradyarrhythmias.
Sinus Node Dysfunction
Bradycardia resulting from sinus node dysfunction can be divided into two broad categories—failure of impulse generation or failure of impulse conduction. Failure of impulse generation refers to an abnormal ability of the SA node to generate an impulse (abnormal automaticity). Failure of conduction occurs when an appropriately generated SA impulse fails to depolarize the atria because of exit block. Common electrocardiographic manifestations of sinus node dysfunction include inappropriate sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, sinus exit block, and chronic atrial ﬁbrillation with a slow ventricular response, and the bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome.
Sinus Bradycardia. The normal heart rate is arbitrarily deﬁned as ranging between 60 and 100 beats/min (bpm). Sinus bradycardia (heart rate Ͻ60 bpm) does not equate with sinus node dysfunction. In fact, heart rates Ͻ40 bpm can be common and asymptomatic in people at rest, particularly in well-trained athletes (3). Sinus bradycardia is considered “inappropriate” and clinically pathologic when symptomatic or when associated with a failure to appropriately increase heart rate during activity or vigorous exercise.
Sinus Pause or Arrest. Sinus pause or sinus arrest occurs when the SA node transiently fails to exhibit normal automaticity. The ECG demonstrates a pause without P waves (Fig. 1). The pause will not be a multiple of the preceding P-P interval. Pauses Ͼ2 secs and Ͻ3 secs are seen in 11% of healthy asymptomatic individuals, whereas pauses Ͼ3 secs during

waking hours are usually because of sinus node dysfunction.
Sinus Exit Block. Sinus exit block also results in a pause. In this case, the SA node ﬁres; however, the impulse is delayed or fails to propagate beyond the sinus node, resulting in failure of atrial depolarization. The ECG again shows a pause without P waves. Type I seconddegree SA exit block demonstrates progressive P-P interval shortening before the pause (duration is less than 2 P-P cycles). In Type II second-degree sinoatrial exit block, the pause duration is theoretically an exact multiple of the previous P-P interval as the SA node continues to ﬁre at its own intrinsic rate. SA node ﬁring is not recorded on the surface ECG (Fig. 2).
Bradycardia-Tachycardia Syndrome. Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome refers to the presence of sinus node dysfunction with both bradycardia and tachycardia (usually demonstrated as paroxysmal atrial ﬁbrillation on surface ECG). Holter monitor studies have demonstrated that clinical symptoms of presyncope or syncope usually arise from the long pauses that accompany termination of the tachycardia (Fig. 3).
Conduction Disturbances Involving the Atrioventricular Node/His Bundle
Abnormalities of the AV node and His bundle are primarily manifested as disturbances in impulse conduction. Clinically, it is important to distinguish between block within the AV node and block within or below the His bundle (infranodal AV block), as both prognosis and appropriate treatment depend on this distinction. The surface ECG can be valuable (but not infallible) in providing clues to help assist in making this differentiation. First, as discussed earlier, prolongation of the P-R interval before block (Wenckebach pattern) is strongly suggestive of AV nodal block, whereas sudden block without prolongation of the P-R interval is very suggestive of infranodal block.

Figure 2. First-degree sinoatrial exit block is characterized by intranodal delay and is not visible on surface electrocardiogram. C, in sinoatrial Wenckebach P-P shortening precedes a pause. B, in Type II second-degree sinoatrial block, the pause is a multiple of the intrinsic P-P interval.

Second, the escape rate in the setting of complete AV block is higher (40 – 60 bpm) in AV nodal block, as the escape pacemaker is usually in the His/proximal Purkinje system. Infranodal block results in a less reliable, more distal (often ventricular) escape rhythm (heart rate Ͻ40 bpm). Third, the width of the QRS complex is helpful for similar reasons. The QRS duration in the setting of AV nodal block is generally relatively narrow (Ͻ120 msecs) whereas the QRS duration in the infranodal block is relatively wide.
First-Degree AV Block. In ﬁrst-degree AV block, each atrial impulse is successfully conducted to the ventricle but with a delay. Thus, each P wave is followed by a QRS but with prolongation in the P-R interval. A P-R interval Ն210 msecs is diagnostic. This delay can theoretically occur anywhere along the conduction system; however, it occurs predominantly within the AV node or above. When the QRS complex is narrow (most common), the level of conduction delay is within the AV node in Ͼ90% of cases (1). However, ﬁrst-degree AV block with a bundle-

branch block/wide QRS may represent infranodal conduction delay in up to 45% of patients (1).
Second-Degree AV Block–Mobitz Type I (Wenckebach). In all types of seconddegree heart block, only some atrial impulses reach the ventricle. It follows that the surface ECG demonstrates some P waves that are not followed by a QRS complex. In typical Mobitz type I block, there is progressive prolongation of the P-R interval with shortening of the R-R intervals before the blocked cycle. Atypical R-R responses are common. Additionally, there is an associated shortening of the P-R interval in the ﬁrst conducted cycle after the block (Fig. 4). Again, Wenckebach block is almost always a result of block in the AV node particularly when associated with a narrow QRS complex.
Second-Degree AV Block–Mobitz Type II. Like second-degree–Type I block, some P waves are not conducted to the ventricles and fail to produce a QRS. However, unlike Type I block, Type II block occurs without prolongation in the

After direct current cardioversion (arrow), there is atrial and ventricular asystole (middle tracing) lasting ϳ6 secs before resumption of sinus rhythm (bottom tracing).

preceding P-R intervals. There is no change in the ﬁrst conducted P-R interval after the blocked P wave (Fig. 5). The level of block is usually infranodal, and thus potentially very dangerous because electrical activation of the ventricles may depend on more unstable and unreliable distal automaticity.
2:1 AV Block. In this special case, every other P wave is followed by a QRS, making it impossible to tell if P-R prolongs before the nonconducted P waves (Fig. 6). In addition to the QRS duration,

certain maneuvers based on the normal conduction properties of the AV node and His-Purkinje System can be performed in a critical care unit to help distinguish the site of block (Table 1).
Third-Degree AV Block. Complete heart block occurs when no atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricles resulting in electrocardiographic ﬁndings of complete atrioventricular disassociation (Fig. 7). The level of block can be either in the AV node or infranodal; however, acquired causes (which predomi-

nate in a critical care setting) are often infranodal and potentially life-threatening. A common exception to this can occur in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI) and is discussed later. Digitalis toxicity is a common cause of reversible AV block. Again, the width and rate of the QRS escape rhythm are very helpful in determining the site of block (4).

function secondary to autonomic instability. Such neurally mediated causes of bradycardia include carotid sinus hypersensitivity and neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope. Although carotid sinus hypersensitivity and typical vasovagal syncope are relatively uncommon in the critical care setting, vagally medicated bradycardia may be very common (Table 2). These bradyarrhythmias may be because of several types of stimuli resulting in increased vagal output. The ECG characteristically shows sinus slowing (which is often irregular) with or without AV block. Typically, no treatment is required because of the transient nature; however, if necessary, these bradyarrhythmias respond to atropine.
Diagnostic Work-Up/Evaluation. Bradyarrhythmias can be caused by either intrinsic disease of the conduction sys-

tem or by extrinsic factors acting on the conduction system. In the critical care setting, extrinsic causes are responsible for the majority of bradyarrhythmias. Clinical attention should focus on identifying and correcting reversible causes. Medications, electrolyte disturbances, and increased vagal tone are common causes (Tables 3 and 4).
Documenting a relationship between symptoms and the observed bradycardia is less problematic in the critical care setting (compared with the ambulatory setting) given the universal use of telemetry monitoring.
Electrophysiologic testing may be indicated to determine the site of AV block if further information is needed for clinical decision making. Tilt table and/or electrophysiologic studies may be required if symptoms of presyncope/syncope

are thought to be secondary to bradycardia and clinical documentation is unavailable.
Bradyarrhythmias Associated with Acute Myocardial Infarction. Bradycardia is observed in 4% to 5% of patients presenting with acute MI (1), and therefore warrants a more detailed discussion. An acute MI can cause bradyarrhythmias by several mechanisms. Sinus node dysfunction may manifest as sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, or sinus arrest and is most common with inferior MI. The mechanism can be either a direct affect on the SA node blood supply (from the right coronary artery), or stimulation of certain receptors in the inferior left ventricle resulting in increased vagal tone (BezoldJarisch reﬂex).
Varying degrees of AV block can also be seen in the setting of an acute MI.

N124

Crit Care Med 2000 Vol. 28, No. 10 (Suppl.)

Prognosis and management depend on the location of the MI, degree of AV block, and hemodynamic stability. During inferior infarction, the site of block is known to be in the AV node because the mechanism of AV block is primarily disruption of blood supply to the AV nodal artery, a branch of the RCA. First-degree, second-

degree (Mobitz Type 1), and even thirddegree AV block are usually transient and asymptomatic. However, they are also associated with more ventricular tachycardia/ ventricular ﬁbrillation, more hypotension, and a higher in-hospital mortality (5). AV block caused by an anterior MI usually occurs below the AV node; the

area is dependent on blood supply from the LAD. Infranodal block results in second-degree (Mobitz Type II) or thirddegree AV block that is often symptomatic and irreversible.
Medical Treatment. Medical therapy has a limited role in the management of bradyarrhythmias. It is useful in emergent situations (requiring immediate intervention) until pacing can be initiated. Atropine and isoproterenol are the most commonly used medications. Both drugs are useful in increasing the activity of the sinus node and improving block within the AV node. Isoproterenol may also improve infranodal block. Isoproterenol should be used with caution in patients

Pacemakers. Pacemakers are the mainstay of therapy for clinically signiﬁcant bradyarrhythmias. In general, the primary indication for pacing is symptomatic bradycardia causing symptoms of central nervous system hypoperfusion (such as presyncope, syncope, confusion) or hemodynamic compromise. Temporary pacemakers are available for emergent use to stabilize patients with symp-

Transcutaneous Pacing. Transcutaneous pacing, ﬁrst introduced by Zoll (6) in 1952 is the oldest form of pacing. Pacing

is achieved by stimulation through electrodes placed on the chest wall. Limitations of this procedure include pain with impulse delivery, skeletal muscle stimulation, and decreased ability to capture the ventricle compared with other methods. The role of transcutaneous pacing is currently limited to emergency situations

requiring rapid initiation of pacing (cardiac arrest attributable to bradycardia or asystole as incorporated in the current ACLS protocol).
Epicardial Pacing. Epicardial pacing is frequently encountered in the critical care setting after cardiac surgery. Typically, leads are placed on the epicardium

during surgery and can readily be removed at anytime. Epicardial pacing wires serve dual diagnostic and therapeutic functions. Diagnosis of arrhythmias is aided, as these wires record atrial and/or ventricular electrical activity. For instance, supraventricular tachycardia is a common postcardiac surgery arrhythmia.

Recording atrial activity with the epicardial wires during supraventricular tachycardia assists in diagnosing the precise arrhythmia mechanism and helps guide therapy. Ventriculoatrial dissociation or block recorded during wide QRS tachycardia conﬁrms that it is ventricular in origin. Epicardial wires can also be used therapeutically to treat or terminate certain atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias by overdrive pacing as well as improving hemodynamic status in selected patients by increasing heart rate (and cardiac output) with pacing.
Transvenous Pacing. Transvenous pacing is the current method of choice for temporary pacing. A pacing catheter is inserted into the heart, directly stimulating the right ventricular myocardium. A percutaneous entry site is chosen, typically either the right internal jugular vein or left subclavian vein as a result of their direct route to the heart. Pacing catheters may be balloon-tipped for easy ﬂoatation to the desired site. The usual desired site of pacing is apex of the right ventricle. Special J-shaped wires are also available to allow atrial pacing. If permanent pacing is anticipated, the side opposite the planned permanent pacemaker site should be used to prevent venous thrombosis and reduce the risk of infection of subsequently implanted permanent pacing leads.
Advantages of transvenous pacing include patient comfort and relative ease, speed, and safety of insertion by experienced personnel. Complications have been reported in 4% to 20% of patients and are usually observed during prolonged use. These include pneumothorax, myocardial perforation, infection, bleeding, ventricular ectopy/nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or (rarely) thromboembolism resulting in a pulmonary embolism. A prosthetic tricuspid valve is a contraindication to placement of a transvenous pacer.
Permanent Pacemakers. Permanent pacemakers are placed for persistent, nonreversible symptomatic bradycardia. These pacemakers are placed transvenously, usually via the left subclavian or cephalic vein. Dual-chamber pacemakers (allowing preservation of AV synchrony) with rate-adaptive features, are preferred over single-chamber devices.
In sinus node dysfunction, dualchamber or atrial pacing is preferred over ventricular pacing (7). Data from Benditt et al. (8) in 1990 suggested atrial or dual chamber pacing as the preferred methods

of pacing, thereby decreasing the incidence of developing atrial ﬁbrillation and thromboembolic events.
Sgarbossa and colleagues (9) subsequently studied the development of chronic atrial ﬁbrillation and stroke in 507 paced patients with sick sinus syndrome. Dual-chamber or atrial pacemakers were used in 395 patients. Stroke and chronic atrial ﬁbrillation were strongly determined by clinical variables and secondarily by a ventricular pacing modality. Ventricular pacing predicted chronic atrial ﬁbrillation only in patients with preimplant paroxysmal atrial ﬁbrillation.
They also found that single-chamber pacing increased the risk of both cardiovascular and total mortality; however, the difference was of borderline statistical signiﬁcance (10). Ventricular pacing was not associated with an increased incidence of congestive heart failure (11).
A more recent multicenter trial compared quality-of-life beneﬁts in ventricular and dual-chamber pacing. Patients with sinus node dysfunction, but not those with AV block, had moderately better cardiovascular functional status and quality of life with dual-chamber pacing (12).
Atrial demand pacing is adequate when there is no other evidence of AV nodal conduction disease (1), whereas ventricular demand pacing is indicated in patients with chronic atrial ﬁbrillation with a normal chronotropic response and infrequent bradycardic episodes (1). Dualchamber pacemakers are still preferred in paroxysmal atrial ﬁbrillation. By programming mode switching within these devices, an automatic shift from DDD to DDI or VVI (nontracking) modes during supraventricular arrhythmias helps to avoid ventricular tracking and pacing of rapid atrial rates.
Indications for Pacing. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force has presented a set of guidelines outlining indications for permanent cardiac pacing. Their recommendations are organized into classes based on clinical and investigational data (Table 5). Tables 6 through 10 contain a selected partial list of the task force recommendations (13).

There are no clinical data to support the efﬁcacy of permanent pacing in patients with asymptomatic sinus node dysfunction (14 –16). In general, pacing in sinus node dysfunction is recommended in patients when symptoms can be attributed to bradycardia (Table 6). Indications for pacing in acquired AV block are outlined in Table 7.
As discussed previously, both sinus node dysfunction and AV block can occur in the acute MI setting. Pacing is rarely needed in sinus node dysfunction related to ischemia or infarct. If pacing is required for symptomatic bradycardia, temporary pacing is preferred, as most cases will resolve over time.
In cases of ischemia or infarction resulting in AV block, the level of block is determined by the location of the MI. Temporary pacing is preferred for inferior MI with symptomatic bradycardia, as most conduction disturbances are transient. Permanent pacing is very rarely needed. Acute anterior MI complicated by symptomatic AV block may require temporary pacing for initial stabilization and commonly requires permanent pacing (see Table 8 for pacing indications after acute MI).
Indications for pacing in chronic bifascicular and trifascicular block are outlined in Table 9. Pacing for hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome and neurally mediated syndromes is outlined in Table 10.
