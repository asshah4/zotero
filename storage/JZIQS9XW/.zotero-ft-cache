Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are aﬀected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of aﬀected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research eﬀorts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.

Introduction
Pulmonary hypertension is deﬁned by a mean pulmonary artery pressure at rest of 25 mm Hg or more, measured by right heart catheterisation.1 According to pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), pulmonary hypertension can be subclassiﬁed as precapillary (PAWP ≤15 mm Hg) or postcapillary (PAWP >15 mm Hg). Based on pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic considerations, pulmonary hypertension is divided into ﬁve groups: pulmonary arterial hypertension; pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart disease; pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease or hypoxia; chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; and pulmonary hypertension with unclear or multifactorial mechanisms (ﬁgure 1).
Although pulmonary hypertension has long been recognised to complicate many common diseases, especially left-sided heart disease and lung disease, most
Key messages
• Pulmonary hypertension is becoming an increasingly common global health issue
• Pulmonary arterial hypertension, especially the idiopathic form, although still a rare disease with an incidence of 2–5 per million adults, is increasingly being diagnosed in elderly people
• Globally, left-sided heart failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, is becoming a leading cause of pulmonary hypertension, probably aﬀecting 5–10% of individuals aged 65 years or older
• Lung disease, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is another leading cause of pulmonary hypertension in all parts of the world
• Schistosomiasis, HIV infection, post-streptococcal rheumatic heart disease, and sickle cell disease are frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension in countries where these diseases are still endemic
• The development of pulmonary hypertension is almost invariably associated with worsening symptoms and increased mortality, independent of the underlying disease

researchers, clinicians, and the pharmaceutical industry have focused on certain forms of pulmonary hypertension, mainly pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Both entities are rare, leading to the belief that pulmonary hypertension in general is a rare condition. More recently, evidence suggests that pulmonary hypertension complicates various common diseases in which the development of pulmonary hypertension is almost invariably associated with aggravation of clinical symptoms and increased mortality. Additionally, the increasing age of populations worldwide is leading to a marked change in the distribution and phenotypes of patients presenting with pulmonary hypertension. A population-based study3 of 3381 participants in Rotterdam, Netherlands, reported echocardiographic signs suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in 2·6% of the overall population. The prevalence of echocardiographic signs of possible pulmonary hypertension was higher in older individuals (8·3% in those older than 85 years compared with 0·8% in those aged between 65 years and 70 years). We summarise the global incidence and prevalence of pulmonary hypertension and derive implications for health-care providers, policy makers, and future research strategies.
Group 1—pulmonary arterial hypertension
The pulmonary arterial hypertension group (ﬁgure 1) comprises patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension due to distinct underlying disorders who share a similar pulmonary angioproliferative vasculopathy that predominantly aﬀects the precapillary arterioles.4 The ensuing rise in the pulmonary vascular resistance leads to increased right ventricular afterload. Without eﬀective therapeutic interventions, patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension eventually die from right heart failure.5
Idiopathic, heritable, or drug-induced, and associated with connective tissue disease or associated with portal pulmonary arterial hypertension Most contemporary pulmonary arterial hypertension registries (table 1) have been established in Europe and

the USA. At least for idiopathic or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, global variation is small between ethnicities and environmental factors such as urbanisation and exposure to drugs or toxins. Genetic causes of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension have been identiﬁed worldwide, germline mutations in the gene coding for bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) cause up to 80% of cases of familiar disease and 20% of cases of sporadic disease.27
The reported incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the developed world is 1·1–7·6 per million adults per year; the prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension is 6·6–26·0 per million adults.10,12,18 Pulmonary arterial hypertension has generally been thought to aﬀect predominantly younger individuals, mostly females.6 This consideration is particularly true for heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, which aﬀects twice as many females as males before the age of 50 years.28 Moreover, female sex is a risk factor for pulmonary arterial hypertension, yet females have better survival than males.29
Since pulmonary arterial hypertension has been deemed to be a disease aﬀecting mostly young people, some registries restrict inclusion to patients 65–70 years or younger.10,11 More recent data from the USA and Europe suggest,17,21,23,30 however, that pulmonary arterial hypertension is now frequently diagnosed in older patients, ie, those 65 years and older, who often present with cardiovascular comorbidities. In the 2014 UK National Audit on Pulmonary Hypertension, the median age at the time of diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension was 60 years and 29% of the patients were 70 years or older.22 In Germany in 2014, the mean age of

patients newly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension was 65 years.21 Older age has been identiﬁed as an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.19,31,30 In developing countries, the average age of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is younger than 40 years.23,24,32 These discrepancies are probably due to several factors, including diﬀerences in the overall population age between developed countries and developing countries, and presumably higher disease awareness as well as easier access to experienced diagnostic facilities in developed countries.
In most pulmonary arterial hypertension registries from the USA and Europe, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension was the most common subtype (50–60% of all cases), followed by pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease, and pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with portal hypertension (portopulmonary hypertension).12,14,18,33 In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective disease, systemic lupus erythematosus is the most common subtype in southeast Asia,24,34 whereas systemic sclerosis is the predominant underlying disease in the rest of the world.8,10,12,14,35 Portopulmonary hypertension is rare, even in areas where viral hepatitis is endemic.36–38
The crude estimate for the global incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (including only idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease, and portopulmonary hypertension) is about 5 million adults per year and a prevalence of about

15 per million adults. Hence, these disorders might aﬀect about 35 000–100 000 individuals worldwide. Of note, these numbers do not include pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease, schistosomiasis, and HIV infection, which play a prominent part in some areas of the world.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease Congenital heart disease aﬀects 0·8% of newborns, with some geographical variation.39 With increasing survival, the prevalence of congenital heart disease is now about 0·5 per 1000 adults, and 4–6% of these patients develop pulmonary arterial hypertension.40,41 On the basis of these numbers, the estimated global prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart disease is about 25 people per million in the general population. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease tend to have a better survival than patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.15 However, compared with patients with congenital heart disease without pulmonary arterial hypertension, patients with

congenital heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension are more symptomatic and have at least a doubled mortality risk.42,43
Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with infectious diseases Present estimates suggest that more than 200 million people worldwide are infected with species of Schistosoma.44 More than 85% of these patients live in Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence of infected individuals can exceed 50% in local populations.45,46 In Brazil, about 20–30% of patients treated in pulmonary hypertension clinics are infected with Schistosoma mansoni.25,47 Pulmonary arterial hypertension develops predominantly in patients with the hepatosplenic manifestation of the disease, which occurs in 4–8% of the patients with chronic schistosomiasis.44,48 A study from Brazil47 reported a prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension of 4·6% in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Mortality in patients with schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension is similar to mortality in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.49 More

than 270 000 people have been estimated to be aﬀected by schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension worldwide.47,50,51 This number might grossly overestimate the true prevalence of schistosomiasisassociated pulmonary arterial hypertension because reliable data are not available for Africa (predominantly Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium species) and southeast Asia (predominantly Schistosoma japonicum species). In these parts of the world, schistosomiasis might be much less frequently associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension than in Brazil but robust evidence is absent.52
The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients living with HIV infection is about 0·5% in Switzerland and France.53,54 In Europe and the Americas, HIV is a rare cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension, accounting for less than 10% of the patients enrolled in contemporary pulmonary arterial hypertension registries.12,14,18,25 Worldwide, about 30 million individuals are infected with HIV.55 If 0·5% of these patients develop pulmonary arterial hypertension, the global prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension due to HIV infection would be about 150 000 cases, possibly making HIV the most common infectious cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The greatest burden of HIV lies in subSaharan Africa where more than 20 million people were aﬀected in 2013, and HIV prevalence exceeded 10% in some areas.55 Here, the prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension due to HIV might be up to 0·5 per 1000 individuals—ie, 20–50 times higher than the prevalence of all pulmonary arterial hypertension subtypes together in the developed world. However, these numbers are hypothetical and are not yet supported by published data.

physician awareness of the disease, especially with respect to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.57,63,65
Postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, either isolated or combined with a precapillary component,2,66 is a frequent complication of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or with reduced ejection fraction, aﬀecting at least 50% of these patients (table 2). In both populations, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with right ventricular dysfunction and at least a doubled mortality risk (table 2).59,60,67,71,77
The pandemic of left-sided heart disease is not conﬁned to high-income countries but has already reached most parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.78,79 Recent studies from sub-Saharan Africa80–85 showed that patients admitted to the hospital for treatment of heart failure were younger than patients in the developed world but risk factors and underlying diseases were becoming similar, with hypertension being the most frequent underlying cause. Data from the Heart of Soweto Cohort86 suggest that pulmonary hypertension might be common in Africans living in an urban environment. From 5328 de-novo presentations to a single tertiary referral centre in South Africa, 2505 cases presented with heart failure and 697 (28%) were noted to have echocardiographic signs suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.86 Apart from concurrent left-sided heart disease (213 [31%] of 697 cases), several contributors to pulmonary hypertension were noted, including 179 (26%) cases of tuberculosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 141 cases (20%) of suspected pulmonary arterial hypertension. In these cohorts, the presence of echocardiographic signs suggestive of pulmonary hypertension was a strong and independent predictor of mortality.80,87

Group 2—pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart disease
In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease Study reported 61·7 million cases of heart failure worldwide, which represented almost a doubling since 1990.56 The leading causes of heart failure were ischaemic heart disease and hypertensive heart disease, followed by myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, and rheumatic heart disease.56
On the basis of estimates from the Framingham Heart Study,57 the lifetime risk of heart failure is about 20% in men and women living in the USA. Both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction aﬀect predominantly elderly people.58–60 In Europe and the USA, more than 80% of patients with heart failure are 65 years of age and older.61 Over the past 30 years, survival has improved for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction but not for patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.58,62–64 The number of elderly patients diagnosed with heart failure is steadily growing, which is due not only to the rapid global rise in the number of people older than 65 years, but also due to the increasing

Aortic stenosis The prevalence of aortic stenosis increases with age. In a population-based study from Norway,88 the prevalence of aortic stenosis was 1·3% in individuals aged 60–69 years and 9·8% in those who were 80–90 years old. The prevalence of severe aortic stenosis needing surgery was about 2% in the 80–90 year olds.88 Based on Medicare data,89 the adjusted incidence rates of patients 75–84 years old undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery increased from 125 per 100 000 in 1999 to 168 per 100 000 in 2011; the respective adjusted incidence rates of patients 85 years or older undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery increased from 48 per 100 000 in 1999 to 91 per 100 000 in 2011, indicating aortic stenosis is becoming an increasingly relevant problem, particularly in ageing populations.
Several studies indicate that 50–70% of patients with severe aortic stenosis develop pulmonary hypertension and that the presence of pulmonary hypertension is associated with about a doubled increase in mortality risk (table 2).70,72–76
Overall, the left-sided heart diseases described previously aﬀect mainly elderly people with a lifetime risk in ageing populations of 20% or higher. Based on the

Review

Rheumatic heart disease Post-streptococcal rheumatic fever has become rare in developed countries but remains a leading cause of heart disease in the developing world, estimated to aﬀect about 15 million individuals worldwide.91 The Global Rheumatic Heart Disease Registry,92 a prospective, international, multicentre, hospital-based study of characteristics, management, and outcome of rheumatic heart disease that enrolled 3323 participants from low-income and middle-income countries, showed that rheumatic heart disease aﬀects predominantly young women, causes multivalvular disease and is associated with high rates of complications, such has heart failure. Echocardiographic signs suggestive of pulmonary hypertension were reported in 28·8% of these patients.92
In a study from southern India, the age-adjusted prevalence of rheumatic heart disease was 9·7 per 1000 and the mean age of the aﬀected patients was 33 years.93 Echocardiographic signs suggestive of pulmonary hypertension were noted in 52% of these patients.93 Similar numbers were reported from Africa, where 53% of patients with newly diagnosed rheumatic heart disease presented with echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension.94 Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure have independent, incremental prognostic value and frequently exclude candidacy for surgery in patients with advanced rheumatic heart valve disease.95 Additionally, pulmonary hypertension complicates pregnancy in women with operated or not operated rheumatic heart disease contributing to increased maternal and fetal mortality.96
These data indicate that rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of pulmonary hypertension in some parts of the world, probably aﬀecting between 3 million and 4 million individuals worldwide. However, these numbers need to be interpreted with caution because they are based almost entirely on echocardiographic assessments.
Group 3—pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease or hypoxia
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is the most common non-infectious lung disease worldwide.97 According to the Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease Initiative,98 the global prevalence of COPD GOLD stage II or higher is about 10% in adults 40 years or older and about 20% in adults 70 years or older. 99 Similar numbers have been reported from other studies implemented in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.100–103 A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of COPD published between 1990 and 2004 calculated a global pooled COPD prevalence in adults 40 years and older of 9–10% (GOLD ≥stage II, 5·5%), which increased to 14·2% in individuals aged 65 years or more.104
The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with COPD is diﬃcult to estimate as most right heart catheter-based data come from highly

selected populations of patients with advanced disease referred for evaluation of lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplantation. In these patient populations, the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension ranged from 30% to 50% (table 3).106,111,112,116 Some of the available population-based studies were completed more than 10 years ago and deﬁned pulmonary hypertension as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 20 mm Hg.105,106,113–115 The reported estimates of pulmonary hypertension prevalence (deﬁned by a mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mm Hg) in patients with COPD has ranged from 18% to 50% (table 3).107–110,111,112,116 Pulmonary hypertension is usually mild in this patient population. The proportion of patients with COPD and more severe pulmonary hypertension indicated by a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 35 mm Hg or more, ranges from 2% to 14% (table 3).106,108,110,112–114,116 Severe pulmonary hypertension in patients with COPD is often associated with other potential causes, such as left-sided heart disease or chronic thromboembolic disease.113
Irrespective of the populations under study, the presence of pulmonary hypertension was associated with more severe symptoms, reduced exercise capacity, and more frequent hospital admissions than in patients without pulmonary hypertension. Mortality was about twice as high in patients with COPD and pulmonary hypertension as in patients with COPD and normal pulmonary artery pressure, even when adjusted for other variables known to aﬀect outcome, such as lung function variables, blood gases, or age (table 3).105,113,115,116
Assuming a global COPD prevalence (disease severity stage II or higher) of 10% in the 2·5 billion adults that are 40 years or older and estimating a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of 10% in these patients,117 about 25 million individuals aged 40 years or older might be aﬀected worldwide by pulmonary hypertension due to COPD. Again, these numbers have to be interpreted with caution as they are based on assumptions rather than population-based studies.
Interstitial lung disease Among the interstitial lung diseases, idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis is by far the most widely studied, including idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis with the presence of pulmonary hypertension. The reported prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis ranges from 2·9 per 100 000 in Japan to 500 per 100 000 in the USA.118–120 Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis occurs predominantly in individuals older than 60 years and the global prevalence is increasing.120–122
Estimating the global prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis is hampered by similar restrictions to patients with COPD. Most catheter-based studied have been done in patients with advanced disease referred for evaluation of lung transplantation. In these studies, the prevalence

Table 3: Right heart catheter-based studies on pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

of pulmonary hypertension in patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis ranged from 29% to 77% (table 4).123,125,126,127 In two cohorts of patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis from Japan,128,129 the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension was 8% and 15%. In a clinical trial with ambrisentan in patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis with mild or moderate lung volume restriction, the prevalence of precapillary pulmonary hypertension was 14% and 5% of patients had postcapillary pulmonary hypertension.131
Cross-sectional studies might, however, underestimate the true lifetime risk of pulmonary hypertension in this

patient population. This theory is supported by the work of Nathan and colleagues127 who completed a longitudinal assessment of pulmonary hypertension in patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis listed for lung transplantation. At the time of admission to the waiting list, 39% of the patients had pulmonary hypertension. An average of 8 months later, at the time of transplant, this ﬁgure had risen to 86%.127 By contrast, no signiﬁcant change was noted in the mean pulmonary artery pressure after 12 months in the clinical trial with ambrisentan in patients with mild or moderate lung volume restriction.131

Table 4: Right heart catheter-based studies on pulmonary hypertension in patients with interstitial lung disease

Assuming an idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis prevalence of 500 per 100 000 individuals 65 years or older, as suggested by Raghu and colleagues,120 and a conservative estimate of pulmonary hypertension of 10% among these patients, the global ﬁgure of patients aﬀected by pulmonary hypertension due to idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis would be about 300 000 individuals older than 65 years. These assumptions do not include other forms of interstitial lung disease, which might also be complicated by the development of pulmonary hypertension.
The eﬀect of pulmonary hypertension on the survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis is substantial.

Several studies have shown that the mortality risk was about three times higher in patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis and pulmonary hypertension compared with patients with idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis without pulmonary hypertension.123,128,129
Pulmonary hypertension due to high altitude More than 140 million people live above 2500 m from sea level and are exposed to chronic hypoxia, particularly in the Andes and Himalayas.134 Some of these individuals develop symptomatic pulmonary hypertension,135,136 but because of the scarcity of systematic studies, the

prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in people living at high altitude is diﬃcult to estimate. The same is true for the clinical implications because pulmonary hypertension is a physiological result of exposure to chronic hypoxia, at least to some extent.137,138 Pulmonary hypertension proportional to hypoxaemia and haematocrit is a complication of chronic mountain sickness.137 High altitude pulmonary hypertension might aﬀect a substantial number of individuals but insuﬃcient data are available to estimate its clinical burden.
Group 4—chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
In a detailed review on chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension,139 the incidence and prevalence of this disease are largely unknown. Studies in patients who survived an episode of acute pulmonary embolism have reported that 1·0–8·8% of them eventually developed chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.140–143 The higher estimates are likely to be an over-representation. In the USA, the annual incidence of acute pulmonary embolism is about 100 in 100 000 adults, increasing with age.144 Individuals aged 25–35 years have a pulmonary embolism incidence of 30 per 100 000 per year, whereas the respective rates in individuals aged 70–79 years are 300–500 per 100 000 per year.144 If 1% of these patients develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, the expected annual incidence would be at least one in 100 000 adults. In the USA, this number would result in about 2500 new cases per year. By contrast, the number of patients undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy (the preferred treatment for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) in the USA is about ten times lower.145
Estimates of the prevalence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension are further restricted by the fact that about 25% of these patients have no history of acute pulmonary embolism.146 Two pulmonary hypertension registries, one from Spain and one from the UK,18,147 have assessed the incidence of patients with an established diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic

pulmonary hypertension. These registries reported annual chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension incidence rates of 0·9 per million in Spain and 1·75 per million in the UK—ie, about a tenth of that expected from the assumptions made previously in this Review (table 5).18,147 Recent data from Germany reported an annual chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension incidence of 4·0 per million adults per year (Hoeper MM, unpublished data). The global prevalence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is diﬃcult to calculate as many of these patients undergo pulmonary endarterectomy surgery (at least in developed countries), which is curative in many cases.145,146,148
Group 5—pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms
Group 5 comprises various diseases that are often accompanied by pulmonary hypertension, which is characterised by unclear and multifactorial underlying mechanisms. One example is chronic renal failure, in which pulmonary hypertension is being increasingly recognised as an important medical issue. Echocardiography-based estimates of pulmonary hypertension prevalence in patients with end-stage renal disease range from 20% to 50%.149–151 The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension in these patients is complex. Most patients with end-stage renal disease have various comorbidities, including a high rate of systolic or diastolic heart failure. Anaemia, ﬂuid overload, and arteriovenous ﬁstulae might be additional factors contributing to the development of pulmonary hypertension.149,150
Pulmonary hypertension is also identiﬁed in patients with systemic disorders such as sarcoidosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and neuroﬁbromatosis, as well as in metabolic disorders such as Gaucher’s disease or glycogen storage disease, and in patients with haemaglobinopathies.152–159 Although pulmonary hypertension is common in some of these diseases, most of them do not contribute substantially to the

global burden of pulmonary hypertension because of their rarity. An important exception is pulmonary hypertension associated with haemoglobinopathies.
Pulmonary hypertension associated with haemoglobinopathies According to WHO estimates, 20–25 million individuals worldwide are aﬀected by homozygous sickle cell disease, most of them living in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and India.160–163 Echocardiographic signs suggestive of pulmonary hypertension are reported in 20–40% of these patients.160,164,165 These numbers need to be interpreted with great caution as several studies reported that the positive predictive value of echocardiography is particularly low in this patient population.165–167 The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease conﬁrmed by right heart catheterisation was 6–10%,165–167 resulting in an estimated 1·0–2·5 million individuals aﬀected by pulmonary hypertension due to sickle cell disease worldwide. Most of these patients show a unique haemodynamic proﬁle with mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressures, elevated right-sided and left-sided ﬁlling pressures, high cardiac output, and a normal or mildly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.165,168 Hence, pulmonary hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease most often presents in a state of high cardiac output failure rather than a state of low cardiac output as

usually encountered in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension,169 although a few patients do have low cardiac output.
The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease increases with age and is associated with more pronounced anaemia, haemolysis, and renal dysfunction.164,165,167 Additionally, the presence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease is associated with impaired functional capacity and an increased risk of death, which was reported to be at least twice as high as in patients with sickle cell disease without pulmonary hypertension.164–168,170
Thalassaemia and spherocytosis are common haemoglobinopathies, but the associated risk of pulmonary hypertension is unclear. Echocardiographic signs suggestive of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in 10–79% of patients with β-thalassaemia,171,172 but the catheter-based pulmonary hypertension prevalence based on a multicentre cross-sectional study was 2·1%.173 Some reports suggest that pulmonary hypertension is more common in patients with thalassaemia intermedia,173–175 although pulmonary hypertension seems rare in well transfused patients with thalassaemia major.176,177 Pulmonary hypertension seems to be rare in patients with spherocytosis and seems to be linked to splenectomy and subsequent pulmonary arterial hypertension or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension rather than to the underlying disease.178,179

Figure 2: Estimated global distribution of the most prevalent forms of (A) pulmonary hypertension and (B) pulmonary arterial hypertension Interpretation should be done with caution as most of the underlying evidence has been derived from populations at risk for pulmonary hypertension and echocardiography data rather than from population-based studies involving right heart catheterisation. Data from the developing world are particularly sparse. Additionally, variations exist within the world regions. In Latin America, for instance, schistosomiasis highly prevalent in Brazil, Venezuela, and the Caribbean, but not in other countries. Schistosomiasis is also prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, but there is almost no data on the association between schistosomiasis and pulmonary arterial hypertension from these areas. HIV is not evenly distributed in Africa and is particularly frequent in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa.

Limitations of studies of pulmonary hypertension
The epidemiology of pulmonary hypertension is much more diﬃcult to study than the epidemiology of systemic hypertension because a reliable diagnosis requires right heart catheterisation, which is an invasive procedure. Therefore, large-scale population-based studies have to rely on echocardiography because invasive tests for epidemiological studies would be neither ethical nor

feasible. The interpretation of these data must take into account that echocardiography is not a reliable method to diagnose pulmonary hypertension.
Several catheter-based studies have been done in patients at risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension and in patients with left-sided heart disease and chronic lung disease. The results of these studies have been largely consistent, therefore conﬁrming each other and also to a large extent, conﬁrming studies on the basis of echocardiography,

indicating some reliability and reproducibility of the available data (tables 2–4). Patients assessed by right heart catheterisation represent those with symptoms or some indication for evaluation, so that there are very few true screening studies of pulmonary hypertension. Most studies come from academic centres oﬀering advanced treatments, such as transplantation, so that the characteristics of the patients under study might not be generalisable to the population at large. Additionally, almost all studies on the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension were cross-sectional by design. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess the true lifetime risk of various disorders associated with pulmonary hypertension.
More uncertainties come from those types of pulmonary hypertension that occur predominantly in lesser-developed parts of the world, such as those reported in patients with schistosomiasis, HIV infection, rheumatic fever, or sickle cell disease. Any estimates of the incidence, prevalence, and eﬀect of these forms of pulmonary hypertension have to be interpreted with great caution. The same is true for prevalence estimates of major diseases, such as left-sided heart failure and lung disease in the developing world, which are often based on clinical symptoms alone rather than on validated diagnostic tests.
Despite these uncertainties, a consistent ﬁnding of almost all studies was the observation that the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with worsening symptoms and shortened survival, independent of the underlying disease. The causes and mechanisms leading to death are enigmatic. Whether pulmonary hypertension is causative for adverse outcomes in most heart and lung disease is not clear; attempts to treat pulmonary hypertension in these disorders have not resulted in clinical beneﬁt. Therefore, patients might die with pulmonary hypertension rather than as a result of the disorder. In most of the diseases discussed in this Review, to what extent pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure contribute to excess mortality is unclear. Importantly, present pulmonary hypertension guidelines state that the use of pulmonary arterial hypertension approved treatments is not recommended in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart disease or lung disease.2,66
Public health implications and conclusions
Pulmonary hypertension is an under-recognised global health issue and is by no means rare. In economically developed countries, left-sided heart disease and lung disease are by far the most common causes of pulmonary hypertension (table 6, ﬁgure 2). About 80% of patients with pulmonary hypertension live in the developing world, where heart disease and lung disease have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension, but other disorders such as schistosomiasis, rheumatic heart disease, HIV, or sickle cell disease continue to play an important part (table 6, ﬁgure 2). Hence, in industrialised countries, pulmonary hypertension aﬀects

Relevant articles were identiﬁed by MMH and JSRG. These articles were retrieved in full and were reviewed for content. Additional relevant references cited in those articles were added, as were relevant references provided by the other authors. Articles published in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and German were considered. All searches and data analyses were restricted to studies of adults. We focused primarily on studies with right heart catheterisation for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension but also considered studies in which the presence of pulmonary hypertension was estimated by echocardiography, especially in areas where a paucity of right heart catheterisation data was available and whenever large populations of more than 100 patients were studied.
mainly elderly people whereas mostly young people are diagnosed in the developing world. Preventive strategies and eﬀective treatments have been or are being implemented for HIV infection, schistosomiasis, and rheumatic fever, which will aﬀect the incidence of pulmonary hypertension associated with these disorders.
At the same time, an increase in the global prevalence of left-sided heart disease and lung disease will continue, and pulmonary hypertension associated with these disorders will be mainly driven by a worldwide increase in life expectancy. In 2015, about 600 million people globally were 65 years or older with a projected number of 700 million for 2020 and 1·6 billion for 2050.180 For 2015, we estimate that up to 50–70 million individuals—almost 1% of all people—were aﬀected by pulmonary hypertension worldwide. This ﬁgure is expected to rise continuously over the next few decades as the global population enlarges and ages. With increasing life expectancy, individuals who reach the age of 40 might have a lifetime risk of one in ten of developing pulmonary hypertension. This risk is similar to the one in ten lifetime risk of developing COPD,104 or to the one in eight remaining lifetime risk for breast cancer in women of the same age.181
Globally, prevention strategies aimed at reducing smoking, particulate matter and household air pollution, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity will have a major role in reducing heart failure and lung disease, which might eventually contribute to reducing the prevalence of some forms of pulmonary hypertension.
Eﬀective treatments have been developed for some of the rare forms of pulmonary hypertension, especially pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.139,182 No treatments directed at the pulmonary circulation have yet proven eﬃcacious for most of the remaining much more frequent forms of pulmonary hypertension in which treatment is that of the underlying disease. Hence, clinical studies and registries are needed to further

elucidate the eﬀect of pulmonary hypertension in the various conditions discussed in this Review and to establish whether preventive strategies and treatments targeting pulmonary hypertension will aﬀect the morbidity and mortality that accompany this disorder.
