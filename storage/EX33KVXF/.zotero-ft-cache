Abstract 
Patients with first-rank symptoms (FRS) of schizophrenia do not experience all of their actions and personal states as their own. FRS may be associated with an impaired ability to correctly attribute an action to its origin. In the present study, we examined regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography during an action-attribution task in a group of patients with FRS. We used a device previously used with healthy subjects that allows the experimenter to modulate the subject's degree of movement control (and thus action attribution) of a virtual hand presented on a screen. In healthy subjects, the activity of the right angular gyrus and the insula cortex appeared to be modulated by the subject's degree of movement control of the virtual hand. In the present study, the schizophrenic patients did not show this pattern. We found an aberrant relationship between the subject's degree of control of the movements and rCBF in the right angular gyrus and no modulation in the insular cortex. The implications of these results for understanding pathological conditions such as schizophrenia are discussed.

Abstract 
Summary 
This chapter discusses the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in identifying the functional anatomy underlying the generation and control of goal-directed arm movements during the action of reaching and grasping objects. PET allows non-invasive measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes elicited by stimulation or activation of neurological or behavioural functions and therefore provides a new and powerful investigative tool. Focal increases in rCBF have been demonstrated when subjects perform simple motor tasks and these changes have provided new insights into the functional organization of voluntary movements. Recently the question of the selection of movements has been addressed as well as the identification of the neural pathways involved in visually guided movements. The findings are concordant with clinical reports of patients with brain lesions and physiological evidence that identify a distributed network for performing visually guided movement. Current research focuses on the anatomical basis of pragmatic cortical representation and semantic cortical representation for objects.

Abstract 
The presence of an “internal clock” in the brain has been assumed to underlie the information processing related to time. This clock plays a critical role in time keeping and time perception, which are closely associated with integrated functions in the brain. To identify the brain areas recruited for time keeping and time perception, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) studies with rhesus monkeys to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as an index of neural activity during time discrimination tasks of different durations ranging from 400 to 1500 ms. Changes in rCBF that covaried significantly with the durations of the target being perceived by subjects were found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the posterior part of the inferior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, and posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, a loss of neuronal function in the DLPFC caused by a local application of bicuculline resulted in the selective reduction of performance in time discrimination tasks. The results indicate that a neural network composed of the posterior inferior parietal cortex to the DLPFC plays a crucial role in the temporal monitoring process in time perception.

Abstract 
This article describes the basic principles underlying positron emission tomography, the tracers available to image various physiological and biochemical processes, and their application to the study of the normal human brain as well as pathological conditions affecting the brain. The processing of sensory and cognitive information in the normal brain and the effects of normal aging on the brain are examined. The physiological and biochemical alteration in the brain due to various pathological conditions are presented. These conditions include cerebrovascular disease, cerebral tumors, movement disorders, psychiatric disorders, dementia, epilepsy, and gene therapy.
