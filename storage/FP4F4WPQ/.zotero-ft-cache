Preliminary data were collected on how emotional qualities of the voice (sad, happy, angry) influence the acoustic underpinnings of neutral sentences varying in location of intra-sentential focus (initial, final, no) and utterance "modality" (statement, question). Short (six syllable) and long (ten syllable) utterances exhibiting varying combinations of emotion, focus, and modality characteristics were analyzed for eight elderly speakers following administration of a controlled elicitation paradigm (story completion) and a speaker evaluation procedure. Duration and fundamental frequency ( f 0) parameters of recordings were scrutinized for "keyword" vowels within each token and for whole utterances. Results generally re-affirmed past accounts of how duration and f 0 are encoded on key content words to mark linguistic focus in affectively neutral statements and questions for English. Acoustic data on three "global" parameters of the stimuli (speech rate, mean f 0, f 0 range) were also largely supportive of previous descriptions of how happy, sad, angry, and neutral utterances are differentiated in the speech signal. Important interactions between emotional and linguistic properties of the utterances emerged which were predominantly (although not exclusively) tied to the modulation of f 0; speakers were notably constrained in conditions which required them to manipulate f 0 parameters to express emotional and nonemotional intentions conjointly. Sentence length also had a meaningful impact on some of the measures gathered. © 2001 Acoustical Society of America.
