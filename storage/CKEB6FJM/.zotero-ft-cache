SUMMARY
Objective To determine whether older primary care patients with a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have lower heart rate variability (HRV) compared to non-depressed patients. HRV is a measure of cardiac autonomic functioning. Method A cross-sectional comparison of 136 elderly persons with MDD and 136 non-depressed controls (matched for age and gender) recruited in family practices in the Netherlands. Depression was determined according to the DSM–IV criteria using the PRIME–MD. HRV was measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG) during a 5-minute supine rest. Results Multivariate analyses showed statistically signiﬁcant decrease in HRV in MDD patients compared with controls. Conclusion Older primary care patients with MDD have a reduced HRV. This may explain why depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Depressive disorders are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Wulsin and Singal, 2003). One of the explanations is that depressive disorders cause a deregulation in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS modulates the electrical and contractile activity of the myocardium through the collaboration of sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) outﬂow. ANS deregulation consists of increased sympathetic activity and reduced vagal activity, which are strongly involved in the pathophysiology of arrhythmogenesis, sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and diabetic neuropathy (Stein and Kleiger, 1999). Measurement of HRV represents a non-invasive and

highly sensitive procedure for investigating cardiac ANS function (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). Reduced HRV points to a disturbed balance between the sympathetic and vagal branches of the ANS. In population studies, decreased HRV is predictive for cardiac events and cardiac mortality among healthy adults (Dekker et al., 2000).
Studies on depression and HRV, mostly performed in psychiatric inpatients, have revealed conﬂicting results. Several studies reported a reduction of HRV (Dalack and Roose, 1990; Rechlin et al., 1994; Guinjoan et al., 1995; Tulen et al., 1996; Stein et al., 2000; Agelink et al., 2002; Nahshoni et al., 2004;) where other studies reported no HRV difference (Yeragani et al., 1991; Moser et al., 1998; Bar et al., 2004) in depressed patients compared with non-depressed controls. This inconsistency may be due to methodological or population differences. It is unknown whether a reduced HRV is present in depressed primary care patients, who constitute the majority of all major depressive disorder (MDD)

patients. In this study we compared the HRV between elderly primary care patients with and without a MDD.
METHODS
In this case-control study we recruited older (55 years and over) patients in waiting rooms of 14 family practices in the Netherlands. Six thousand seven hundred and nineteen persons were screened for depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale 15item questionnaire (GDS-15) (Burke et al., 1991). All persons who scored 5 points or more were asked to participate in a diagnostic interview by a trained interviewer, using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) (Spitzer et al., 1994). Exclusion criteria were antidepressant treatment (drugs or psychotherapy) in the last six months, alcohol dependence, psychosis or cognitive impairment. The participating MDD patients were matched on sex and age to a person with a negative GDS-15 score. All participants gave their written informed consent prior to inclusion for the study. The ethical committee of the VU University Medical Center approved the study. One week prior to the physical examination the severity of the depressive symptoms was measured with the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979). Controls who scored 10 or higher (n ¼ 11) on the MADRS and MDD patients who scored under 10 (n ¼ 8) were excluded from the comparison.
Measurements of HRV using ECG took place at the VU University medical research centers in Amsterdam and Hoorn. All examinations took place in the morning between 8.00 and 11.00 am. The subjects were asked not to drink caffeine or smoke before the examination. During the ﬁve-minute supine rest a 12-lead ECG and software of CardioPerfect# were used. The following ECG variables were calculated as indicators of ANS function. Time domain variables including: (a) the Standard Deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN) as an estimate of overall HRV and (b) the Root Mean Square Successive Differences of NN intervals (rMSSD), which indicate mostly parasympathic activity (Kleiger et al., 1992). Power spectral analysis was done by a Fast-Fourier transformation, whereby three frequency bands were automatically separated: (c) High Frequency band (HF; 0.15– 0.4 Hz); (d) Low Frequency band (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz); (e) Very Low Frequency band (VLF; 0.003–0.04 Hz), The short 5-min analysis period precludes a conclusive interpretation of the VLF. The LF-band is asso-

ciated with both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, while the HF-band reﬂects the respiratory sinus rhythm resulting from centrally mediated cardiac vagal control (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996).
Blood pressure was measured manually using a cuff ﬁxed on the left arm. Height and weight were measured to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale for Anxiety (HADS-A) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) was used to measure co-morbid anxiety symptoms.
The HRV measures were log transformed to produce normal distributions. Univariate regression analyses were used to determine whether the HRV measures differed between the MDD and the control group. We explored potential confounding and effectmodiﬁcation on the relation between depression and HRV. No confounding and effect-modiﬁcation was found. In a multivariate analysis we adjusted for age, sex, smoking, diabetes and heart medicine (beta blocking agents and calcium channel blockers). These variables have previously been associated with HRV measures and depression (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Carney et al., 2001). Associations were expressed in regression coefﬁcients (B) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI).
RESULTS
The screening revealed 187 eligible patients of which 63% participated in our study. The non-participants had a comparable gender distribution (66.7% vs 64.0% female), but were older (71.55 vs 67.59 years), and had on average a lower PRIME-MD score (5.86 vs 6.37) with the participating patients. Table 1 shows the characteristics of 124 of 136 eligible MDD participants that were matched with a control because 12 male patients dropped-out before the physical examination. The MDD patients had a higher anxiety score on the HADS-A (t ¼ À12.52, df ¼ 256, p < 0.01), had more self-reported cardiovascular diseases (2 ¼ 5.41, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.02), were more often diabetic (2 ¼ 5.82, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.02), had more chronic diseases (t ¼ À2.59, df ¼ 258, p ¼ 0.01) and used more prescription medications (2 ¼ 5.82, df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.02). Women with MDD had a higher mean BMI. Other general characteristics of the depressed group and the controls did not differ signiﬁcantly.
Univariate analyses of HRV characteristics show that MDD patients had signiﬁcantly lower SDNN

Table 2 shows the regression coefﬁcient (B) of depression for the univariate and multivariate analysis. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes and heart medication (beta blocking agents and calcium channel blockers), the log transformed HRV measures; SDNN (B ¼ À0.09, 95% CI ¼ À0.15–0.02) rMSSD (B ¼ À0.10, 95% CI ¼ À0.18–0.01) LF power (B ¼ À0.16, 95% CI ¼ À0.31–0.02) and HF power (B ¼ À0.18, 95% CI ¼ À0.36–0.01) remained significantly lower for the MDD group compared with the control group. The severity of depression, expressed by the MADRS score, did not add to difference in the HRV measures between the MDD patients and the control group in multivariate analysis. The

HADS-A score was highly correlated with the MADRS score (r ¼ 0.63, p < 0.01). Anxiety, demographic or medical variables did not display interaction between depression and HRV measures.
DISCUSSION
Our study showed an impaired HRV among older primary care patients with MDD. MDD patients had a reduced overall HRV (SDNN) and an inhibited vagal tone (rMSSD, HF-power). This is the ﬁrst HRV study among a large group of older depressed patients in primary care, who were diagnosed using an established diagnostic instrument and for whom it was possible to adjust for potential confounders and modiﬁers. The study supports the hypothesis that deregulation of cardiac ANS control is a mechanism

that links depression to an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as found in epidemiological cohort studies (Rugulies, 2002; Wulsin and Singal, 2003). So far HRV differences have been reported only among psychiatric inpatients with MDD compared to healthy controls (Tulen et al., 1996; Agelink et al., 2002; Nahshoni et al., 2004).
The cross-sectional design of our study limited the insight in the dynamics of the relation between depression and HRV. Future research should investigate if changes in depression over time result in HRV alterations. Another fruitful area for future research would be to test whether integrating cardiovascular and affective treatment strategies would help to reduce the cardiovascular sequel of affective disorders in older patients.
