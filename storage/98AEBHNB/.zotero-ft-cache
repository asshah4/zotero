Abstract
While the interplay between heart failure (HF) and atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) has been extensively studied, little is known regarding HF and atrial ﬂutter (AFL), which may be managed differently. We reviewed the incidence, prevalence, and predictors of HF in AFL and vice versa, and the outcomes of treatment of AFL in HF. A systematic literature review of PubMed/Medline and EMBASE yielded 65 studies for inclusion and qualitative synthesis. No study described the incidence or prevalence of AFL in unselected patients with HF. Most cohorts enrolled patients with AF/AFL as interchangeable diagnoses, or highly selected patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of HF in AFL ranged from 6% to 56%. However, the phenotype of HF was never deﬁned by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). No studies reported the predictors, phenotype, and prognostic implications of AFL in HF. There was signiﬁcant variation in treatments studied, including the proportion that underwent ablation. When systolic dysfunction was tachycardia-mediated, catheter ablation demonstrated LVEF normalization in up to 88%, as well as reduced cardiovascular mortality. In summary, AFL and HF often coexist but are understudied, with no randomized trial data to inform care. Further research is warranted to deﬁne the epidemiology and establish optimal management.

Introduction
Atrial ﬂutter (AFL) is an atrial macro-rentrant tachyarrhythmia,1 further subcategorized as cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent and non-CTI-dependent atypical ﬂutter.2 Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) and AFL often coexist due to shared risk factors and precipitants. Both rhythms may be a cause or consequence of heart failure (HF) and are associated with stroke and increased mortality.3–6 Treatment options for both rhythms include pharmacologic rate control7,8 and rhythm control (anti-arrhythmic drugs,8,9 cardioversion,9,10 and catheter ablation11–13).
Most studies treat AFL and AF as interchangeable diagnoses.5,14 However, more than 70% of patients with AFL do not experience AF, and less than 10% with AF are also diagnosed with AFL.15,16 Furthermore, the distinction

between AF, typical, and atypical AFL is important, as the
risks and success of catheter ablation are markedly
different. For AF, long-term freedom from all recurrent
atrial arrhythmias exceeds 50% with a single procedure, and approximately 70–80% with multiple procedures, acknowledging selected cohorts and expertise.17 In small
randomized trials, AF ablation reduced the composite of
death and hospitalization in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction.10,11 By contrast, single-procedure ablation success rates exceed 90% for typical and atypical AFL,2 with associated acute complication rates of 3–11%.12,13 Ablation of AFL in unselected patients is associated with decreased
hospitalizations, emergency department visits, development of subsequent AF,18 and improved quality of life.1,19 Guidelines therefore recommend it as ﬁrst-line therapy.20 However, few studies included patients with HF, and there

are no randomized controlled trials in patients with AFL and HF.
We therefore conducted a systematic review to deﬁne the following: (i) incidence, prevalence, and predictors of HF in AFL; (ii) incidence, prevalence, predictors, and phenotype of AFL in HF; (iii) overlap of AFL with AF in HF; (iv) prognosis of patients with HF and AFL compared with HF and no AFL; and (v) evidence for treatments of AFL in HF.

were reviewed for additional citations. English language studies fulﬁlling the participant, outcome, and study design criteria were included. Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion, and full texts reviewed by the primary author (M.J.D.), with conﬁrmation by the supervising author (N.M.H.). Articles were excluded during full-text review if they did not report on HF patients, were narrative review articles, did not report either clinical outcomes or epidemiological estimates, or duplicated previously published data. Results are synthesized qualitatively due to heterogeneity in objectives, design, and results.

Search strategy
PubMed and EMBASE were searched without date restriction, limited to adult humans and English language, excluding case studies, reviews, and conference abstracts. The search strategy combined Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords in title and abstract to identify HF and AFL (Supporting Information). Reference lists of included articles

Results
The search identiﬁed 1404 articles in PubMed, 101 unique articles in EMBASE, and 4 articles added via bibliography review, totalling 1509 records (Figure 1). Of these, 65 met inclusion criteria. Only 10 studies included patients exclusively with AFL. The remaining 55 studies included both AF and

AFL, of which 21 studies reported the proportion with AFL separately. No study speciﬁcally described atypical AFL, and so all further discussion of AFL relates to either the typical phenotype or undifferentiated AFL only.
Heart failure in atrial ﬂutter: epidemiology overview
Twenty-ﬁve studies reported the epidemiology of HF in patients with AFL alone (n = 16) or AFL/AF as a combined diagnosis (n = 9) (Tables 1 and S1). In all 25 studies, HF was deﬁned clinically based on the development of typical symptoms and signs, an existing clinical diagnosis, or administrative database coding. No study deﬁnition speciﬁed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The prevalence of HF in hospital or ambulatory populations with AFL ranged from 8% to 56%. The prevalence of HF was higher in patients with established AFL (14% to 56%) compared with newly diagnosed AFL (6% to 28%) (Table 1 and Figure 2). The incidence rate was between 0.9 and 3.6 per 100 person-years. Potential factors contributing to the diverse estimates include differences in arrhythmia duration, setting (inpatient vs. outpatient), study design (e.g. retrospective vs. prospective), cohort inclusion criteria, case ascertainment methods, coding, and indication bias among patients referred for catheter ablation. Nine studies (Table S1) combined AF and AFL diagnoses without disclosing the proportion of patients with AFL, and are not discussed further.5,14,33–39

deﬁned using inpatient, outpatient, and electrocardiogram records.28,32 A similar prevalence of comorbid HF (23%) was observed in 121 patients developing AFL in the Framingham Heart Study.30 However, another Framingham study using a nested case-control design reported a lower prevalence of 8% in 112 individuals, the reason for the discrepancy being unclear.4 Finally, a large Taiwanese national study (n = 6121) and Canadian provincial registry (n = 9339) of incident AFL cases identiﬁed using administrative records reported lower rates of HF at 13% and 6%, respectively.15,16
Heart failure in atrial ﬂutter: incidence and prevalence of heart failure in atrial ﬂutter compared with atrial ﬁbrillation
Eight studies reported prevalent HF in AFL and AF separately but within the same cohort and provide insights to their comparative frequency (Table 1). The prevalence of HF was similar in AFL compared with AF in ﬁve studies, and notably higher in three studies (45% vs. 35%,24 14% vs. 6%,23 and 28% vs. 17%28). The two studies from Wisconsin conﬁrmed the higher prevalence of HF in AFL vs. AF, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.87 to 3.5.28,32 By contrast, in three studies reporting long-term outcomes, AFL had similar4 or even lower16,31 adjusted risk of incident HF or HF hospitalization compared with AF. However, the latter two studies used administrative data to deﬁne the cohort and outcomes in Taiwan.

Heart failure in established atrial ﬂutter

Heart failure in atrial ﬂutter: phenotype and predictors

Only three studies examined HF patients solely with AFL.12,21,22 In a large contemporary US cohort with AFL undergoing ablation (n = 5552), 31% had concurrent HF deﬁned using administrative data.12 The prevalence of HF in AFL was
even higher in two small historic cohorts: 40% in 110 patients undergoing ablation (1994–1997) and 56% in 71 patients hospitalized in Atlanta (1966–1970).21,22
Twelve studies included patients with both AF and AFL but
separately reported characteristics of patients with AFL. The
largest study reported HF in 30% of patients with AFL (n = 20 298), deﬁning the cohort and comorbidities using International Classiﬁcation of Disease (ICD) 9 codes in the US MarketScan claims database.26

Only one study characterized the phenotype of HF in patients with AFL. In a small post-ablation cohort from Boston (n = 36), patients who developed ‘symptomatic HF’ had slightly lower mean LVEF at baseline (43 vs. 55%, P = 0.071).23 No study examined independent predictors of HF in AFL.
Atrial ﬂutter in heart failure: incidence and prevalence
No study described the incidence or prevalence of AFL in unselected patients with HF (Table 2), including any of the major HF registries.

Heart failure in newly diagnosed atrial ﬂutter
In patients with newly diagnosed AFL, a higher prevalence of HF (22% and 28%) was reported in two studies (n = 76 and n = 181) from the Marshﬁeld Epidemiologic Study Area in Wisconsin, a comprehensive population-based cohort

Atrial ﬂutter in heart failure: phenotype and predictors

Heart failure and atrial ﬂutter

4489

Area general population study, 22% of whom had HF,
90% had electrocardiograms consistent with typical CTI-dependent AFL.32 Similarly, 84% of 1269 patients referred
to a French centre for AFL ablation, 15% of which had prior HF, presented with ‘counter-clockwise’ AFL.40

of AFL in HF relative to either sinus rhythm or AF have never been investigated (Table 3; additional details in Table S2).
Atrial ﬂutter in heart failure: treatment

Atrial ﬂutter in heart failure: concomitant diagnosis and subsequent development of atrial ﬁbrillation
The overlap between AFL and AF in HF is poorly described. Without speciﬁc studies in unselected patients with HF, several indirect observations merit consideration. In a US national outpatient database derived from insurance claims (n = 484 537), isolated AFL was least common (0.03%), dual diagnosis AF/AFL more frequent (0.1%), and lone AF most common (1.4%).26 However, only a minority of patients in each group (28–30%) had concurrent HF, deﬁned by ICD-9 codes.
In four studies of highly selected patients with HF/ left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and AFL referred for ablation, 33% overall (range 25% to 57%) had concurrent AF (Table 2).22,43,44,61 Following AFL ablation, AF developed in 17–30% of patients over 350 days to 2 years.22,61 De novo AF was strongly associated with LVSD following AFL ablation:: 43% vs. 14% comparing LVEF < 50% vs. >50%, and 31% vs. 7% for LVEF < 35% vs. 36–55% in two US single-centre cohorts.22,61 In the remaining cohort and case series studying tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, the small sample sizes limit meaningful conclusions regarding the overlap.43,44
Atrial ﬂutter in heart failure: prognosis
While 13 studies examined mortality and/or rehospitalization in AF/AFL as a combined diagnosis, the prognostic implications

Thirty-one studies described treatment of patients with AF or AFL, some or all having pre-existing HF or LVSD (Table 4). From these, 14 studies described the management separately for AF and AFL patients, of which 5 described electrical cardioversion, 10 catheter ablation,8,22,40–45,61,68 and 9 drug therapy.8,21,24,41,42,65,68,69
For cardioversion, among 19 825 US inpatients with AFL (16% with existing HF), concurrent HF was associated with an increased odds of receiving electrical cardioversion during hospitalization.8 Potential explanations include that decompensated HF prompted cardioversion, anti-arrhythmic drug options are limited in HF, and greater cardiology specialist involvement in care. Across all studies, early and long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion ranged from 89% to 96% and 42% to 90%, respectively.36,65,69 The highest long-term success rate was achieved in 50 Dutch patients, of whom 16% had ‘cardiomyopathy’ not otherwise deﬁned, using cardioversion and progressive anti-arrhythmic drugs with repeat cardioversion if needed.69 Cardioversion had similar short-term success (96%) among New Zealand patients admitted with HF and LVEF ≤ 40%, of whom 46 of 77 had concurrent AFL.68 This was the only study reporting outcomes after cardioversion or pharmacologic treatment of AFL in unselected HF patients, with a 1 year all-cause mortality or rehospitalization rate of 23% following cardioversion. Only four other studies reported outcomes after cardioversion or pharmacologic treatment in subgroups with AFL, although only 16% to 56% had concurrent HF (Table 4).8,21,24,69
In the 10 catheter ablation studies, immediate procedural success ranged from 87% to 100%, with AFL recurrence of

5–30% up to 2.3 years.22,45,68 Only the aforementioned nonrandomized New Zealand study described clinical outcomes
in unselected HF patients undergoing ablation, with lower
1 year all-cause mortality or rehospitalization than patients undergoing cardioversion (8 vs. 23%, P = 0.57).68
Seven studies speciﬁcally reported outcomes after treatment in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (with or without ablation or LVSD control groups) — ﬁve after catheter ablation,40–44 and two with pharmacologic rate or rhythm control (Table 4).43,44 Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy was typically deﬁned as LVEF < 40–50% with concurrent tachyarrhythmia, no alternate aetiology identiﬁed, and subsequent improvement with arrhythmia control.75 The rates of
LVEF improvement (57% to 100%) or normalization (33% to
88%) appear greater than in unselected patients with HF, with improvement variably deﬁned as LVEF increase of 5% to 15%, or to above 40% (Table 4). Factors associated with failed LVEF recovery included age,40 ischaemic heart disease,40 prior anti-arrhythmic use,40 lack of heart rate reduction,41,43 and increasing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter.44 AFL-related
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy was associated with
lower cardiovascular mortality compared with LVSD unrelated
to AFL among French patients undergoing catheter ablation;
this was the only study that described survival after treatment of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.40

Discussion
This systematic review has several key ﬁndings. First, the incidence and prevalence of HF in patients with AFL is high. Second, in unselected patients with HF, remarkably little is known about AFL—the incidence, prevalence, predictors, phenotype, overlap with AF, role of imaging, prognostic implications, and pharmacological treatment have not been described. Finally, ablation has mainly been studied in selected cohorts with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, so the effectiveness in patients with AFL and HF due to other aetiologies is unknown. Figure 3 provides a summary of key ﬁndings.
Heart failure in atrial ﬂutter
The incidence and prevalence of HF in AFL was high, particularly in patients with prevalent AFL (28% to 56% in six studies). Because many studies enrolled patients undergoing catheter ablation, the most generalizable estimate of HF prevalence in patients with established AFL was 28% observed in the US MarketScan claims database.26 The prevalence of HF in newly diagnosed AFL is likely lower, reported to be 6–13% in large contemporary cohorts.15,16

How much of this high prevalence relates to tachyarrhythmia vs. shared risk factors is unclear. The phenotype of HF including LVEF and aetiology is also uncertain. The ﬁnding of similar or higher risk of developing HF in AFL relative to AF requires further conﬁrmation. Yet, if the prevalence of LVSD in AFL is high, then routine assessment of cardiac function may be appropriate to ensure timely initiation of guideline-directed medical therapies. The diagnostic yield and cost effectiveness of such a strategy would require evaluation. Additionally, if AFL conveys signiﬁcantly increased risk of HF, and this risk is modiﬁable, then earlier and more aggressive intervention may be warranted. Therapeutic strategies that could be compared include electrical cardioversion or AFL ablation.
Atrial ﬂutter in heart failure
In the general population, the prevalence of both HF and AF/ AFL is increasing.14,76,77 AFL concurrent with HF will accordingly increase. The implications for health systems need deﬁning, starting with the burden of disease and associated healthcare utilization including ambulatory and hospital care. If the prognostic implications of AFL are similar to AF/AFL considered as a combined diagnosis, then HF hospitalization may be a marker of further adverse events, and an opportune time to intervene. Whether arrhythmia is an indicator of risk, such as a consequence of increasing ﬁlling pressures leading to atrial remodelling and subsequent AFL, or a target for speciﬁc interventions, warrants investigation. It also remains unclear whether typical AFL may be a consequence of right-sided HF. While the studies included in this review do not report phenotype of HF nor right-sided involvement, studies examining atrial arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with predominant right ventricular involvement may provide further insight. Among four studies of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients (n = 36 to 294),78–81 2– 11% had documented AFL compared with 8–11% with AF, and 2–19% with both AF and AFL. Atrial arrhythmias were associated with either right-sided or left-sided ventricular dysfunction or chamber enlargement, but analyses among patients speciﬁcally with AFL were never reported.
There is insufﬁcient evidence to comment on speciﬁc elements of a rate control strategy. However, the early success of cardioversion was high, as was longer term rhythm control using anti-arrhythmic drugs in selected studies. Whether the beneﬁts of ablation in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy extend to HF due to alternate aetiologies also merits study. This is particularly relevant given the high success rates and reduction in de novo AF resulting from CTI ablation,18 as well as the accruing evidence to suggest prognostic beneﬁt from PVI ablation for concurrent AF and HF.10,11,82 The CAMERA-MRI trial demonstrated greater improvement in ventricular function after PVI ablation in the absence of ventricular

ﬁbrosis on cardiac MRI.83 Similar studies are warranted in patients with AFL to develop more personalized treatment pathways.
Overlap of atrial ﬁbrillation with atrial ﬂutter
The intersection between AF and AFL has two distinct perspectives: (i) the prevalence of AFL in patients with AF and (ii) the prevalence of AF in patients with AFL. Because AF is approximately 10-fold more common than AFL in the general population,26 if even a small proportion of patients with AF have concurrent AFL (e.g. 10%), then a large proportion of patients with AFL have concurrent AF. The trials of AF in HF offer another potential view of the overlap between AF and AFL.82 However, only one study described the proportion of patients with concomitant AFL (9%).84
The overlap between AFL and AF also merits consideration when planning ablation for AFL in patients with LVSD, as up to 43% of whom subsequently develop AF.22 Concurrent PVI and CTI ablation could be considered without documented AF in those deemed high risk for future AF. Alternatively, pulmonary vein triggers for both arrhythmias could be targeted, as currently being studied in the CRAFT trial.85 However, randomized controlled trials are needed to examine these strategies in patients with HF before adoption into clinical practice. Further, in those with multiple arrhythmias amenable to ablation, personalized ablation strategies chosen from a combination of presenting arrhythmias, clinical and treatment history, imaging, and mapping may ultimately yield the best clinical outcomes.
Limitations
Several limitations merit consideration and highlight areas for further research. Many studies considered AF and AFL as an interchangeable diagnosis, reﬂecting the limited accuracy of ICD coding to distinguish AFL in administrative databases.86 Many HF trials require elevated natriuretic peptide levels for inclusion, so these patients may be distinct from patients with AF/AFL enrolled in community-based cohorts or registries. The signiﬁcant heterogeneity in study design, populations, and outcomes prevented quantitative synthesis.
Conclusion
There is limited evidence in all aspects of the intersection between AFL and HF. Outcomes for these patients are unknown, and the treatments and processes of care provided are poorly deﬁned. While previous efforts have largely focused on AF and HF, future studies need to characterize the burden of disease and contemporary management of AFL
