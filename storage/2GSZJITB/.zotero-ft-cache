Abstract 
Abstract 
Pharmacotherapy in ALS has been developed to block several steps of presumed cell death process involved with motor neuron degeneration. To counteract glutamate excitotoxicity, branched-chain amino acids and NMDA-receptor antagonists were tested but ineffective. Riluzole that mainly inhibits presynaptic glutamate release is found to prolong the survival and perhaps slow the disease process. It has become the first approved drug for ALS in the USA. An oral AMPA-receptor antagonist is soon to be tested. The discovery of mutated superoxide dismutase (SOD) in a familial ALS triggered great interests in using SOD for ALS treatment, but it is controversial. Anti-oxidants or free radical scavengers may be an important neuroprotective therapy. Acetyl cysteine appears to be promising but requiring further study. Selegiline and vitamins E & C are not effective. Neurotrophic factors, that may prevent apoptosis and enhance axonal regeneration, have been extensively tested as potential therapy. Ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment turned out to be ineffective. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, although negative, seems to suggest a need for further investigations. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) slows motor dysfunction and deterioration of psychological domain of quality of life. IGF-I is now being evaluated for the second approved drug for ALS. For these trophic factors, new delivery routes have been devised. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor is tested by intraventricular route. An oral drug stimulating endogenous neurotrophic factors is an important alternative approach. If a monotherapy is only modest in treating ALS, a combination treatment is a logical next step. Pharmacotherapy in ALS has entered its exciting stage.

Abstract 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease in adults. It affects motor neurons in the central nervous system. The discovery of novel mutations in the gene encoding SOD1 that cause familial ALS has led to the development of genetically engineered animal models that have substantially enhanced our understanding of this disease. In nearly 98% of ALS cases, the cause for the disease is unknown. There are several proposed mechanisms which may produce the clinical phenotype of ALS. This article reviews the various aspects of ALS, including clinical features, pathology, epidemiology, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical management, and potential therapies.

Abstract 
The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/parkinsonism–dementia complex is a long latency disease of three Pacific isolates, and its diverse immunopathology is expressed as classical ALS, parkinsonism, and dementia. In Guam during the past 40 years, its incidence has declined, its age of onset has increased, and its predominant phenotype has altered from ALS to dementia.

Experimental Rationale for the Therapeutic Use of Neurotrophins in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Abstract 
 
Current therapeutic efforts to treat chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease include, for the first time, attempts to regenerate affected nervous tissue using neurotrophic factors. The rationale for using trophic factors includes the understanding that they support neuronal survival and regrowth processes. The potential benefits of trophic factor therapy will be no more realized in the near future than in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is pathologically characterized by the selective degeneration of specific populations of cranial and spinal motoneurons. Evidence for the existence of factors that support motoneurons has come from studies demonstrating that motoneurons receive trophic influences from various tissues, both central and peripheral, within their local environment. Although the identity of these putative tissue-derived factors has remained enigmatic, recent studies have demonstrated that several previously characterized trophic factors exhibit trophic influences on motoneurons. Among these are several members of the neurotrophin family, most notably brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These neurotrophins meet most of the criteria to be considered motoneuron trophic factors: they are locally available to motoneurons in vivo ; motoneurons express specific receptors for these factors; and exogenous application of these factors mimicks the effects of the uncharacterized endogenous agents. The clinical use of these factors for the treatment of ALS, therefore, appears to be scientifically justified.
