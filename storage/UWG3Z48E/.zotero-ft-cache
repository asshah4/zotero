Vagal Neuromodulation for Atrial Arrhythmias*
Kalyanam Shivkumar, MD, PHD,a,b Jeffrey L. Ardell, PHDa,b

A trial arrhythmias following cardiac surgery is a well-recognized problem that prolongs hospitalization and increases health care expenses. Post-operative atrial ﬁbrillation (POAF) reﬂects the dynamic interplay between the underlying cardiac electrical substrate and its modulation by the cardiac nervous system, both of which can be altered by the surgical procedures, especially by local reactive inﬂammatory processes (1). Standard care using antiarrhythmic pharmacological therapy for POAF has had limited efﬁcacy (2). Autonomic regulation therapy is an emerging therapeutic option that leverages control of autonomic activities to impact organ function, in this case the heart.
Autonomic control of the heart reﬂects the delicate interplay between intrathoracic, spinal cord, brainstem, and higher center reﬂexes (3,4). Intrathoracic reﬂexes comprise the intrinsic cardiac and intrathoracic (stellate/middle cervical/mediastinal) ganglia and are primarily associated with cardiocentric control on a beat-to-beat basis (3,4). Central reﬂexes involve sensory inputs conveyed by nodose, dorsal root, and petrosal ganglia to various regions of the

central nervous system (spinal cord, nucleus of the solitary tract, hypothalamus, and so forth) with primary control of whole-body homeostasis (3,4). Imbalances within and between these layers of reﬂex neural control, either inherent or acquired, can be arrhythmogenic and therefore can also serve as targets for bioelectronic modulation.

The paper by Stavrakis et al. (5) in this issue of JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology evaluates the effects of lowlevel vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), applied extrapericardially but just rostral to the heart, where the intrathoracic vagosympathetic trunk runs between the superior vena cava and ascending aorta. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft and/or value surgery, were selected for this study. In a randomized design, half of the patients received VNS at a level that was 50% of the bradycardiac threshold as determine at 20 Hz and 0.1-ms duration and maintained until discharge from the intensive care unit (w61 h of treatment). The remaining patients had electrode implant but with no stimulation. The authors reported a signiﬁcant drop in POAF in the treatment group (12% vs. 36%) and a corresponding decrease in serum levels of tumor necrosis
factor-a and interleukin-6. The data are consistent
with the conclusions that low-level VNS can reduce the arrhythmia potential and mitigate inﬂammation.
Bioelectronic neuromodulation engages various levels of autonomic control, depending on the characteristics of stimulation and the site to which it is applied. The site leveraged in the Stavrakis et al. (5) study is a location where there are mixed nerves containing afferent (thoracic and visceral) and efferent (parasympathetic and sympathetic) projections (6). The inability of a subset of selected patients to respond to even the highest intensity levels of nerve stimulation may reﬂect the fact that many of the parasympathetic efferent projections to atrial tissues may

have exited the vagosympathetic trunk rostral to the chosen stimulation site (7,8), the selection of a pulse
width of 100 ms (9), and/or opposing effects on para-
sympathetic activity evoked from afferent versus efferent axon activation (9,10). It should also be recognized that the area being stimulated is anatomically close to the posterior atrial ganglionic plexus (11), a region that regulates major sympathetic-

parasympathetic interactions for control of atrial function (12,13) (Figure 1). As appropriately pointed by Stravakis et al. (5), although effective in this implementation for POAF control neither the stimulation site for VNS nor the stimulation protocols have been optimized. It is also likely that stimulation protocol optimization for 1 target effect (e.g., POAF) is different from another target (e.g., anti-inﬂammatory inﬂuences).

Low-Level Vagal Stimulation Attenuates Post-Operative AF

Memory function as it relates to VNS, both for POAF and the anti-inﬂammatory effects, is another important aspect brought forth in the Stravakis et al. (5) study. For POAF, even though VNS was only maintained for w61 h, the efﬁcacy against atrial ﬁbrillation was maintained throughout the 1-month follow-up period. With regards to the antiarrhythmic effects to short-duration (3 min) VNS for atrial ﬁbrillation, that effect lasts for w26 min (14). The memory function to more prolonged VNS may be correspondingly greater. Alternatively, it should also be considered that major changes in intrinsic cardiac network excitability occur within the ﬁrst 4 days after a major cardiac perturbation (15) and the presence of VNS may downregulate excitability in this critical time of remodeling (16) to help maintain atrial electrical stability. The anti-inﬂammatory effects associated with VNS reported in are consistent with previous data (17) and it is remarkable that even short-duration VNS daily can exert long-lived inﬂuences. This memory function can have important

implications for clinical implementation of multiple forms of autonomic regulation therapy (3,4).
Understanding the dynamics between neurohumoral control mechanisms of the heart in health and the adaptation to stress can provide new clues for treatment. Some of these stresses, such as ischemia, can be catastrophic (18,19); other types produce slower transitions to compromised cardiac function (20,21). With increased understanding of the structure/function organization for cardiac control, bioelectronic approaches and neuropharmacological approaches can be applied to manage these problems (22,23). Eventually “closed-loop” modes of treatment can be developed to help preserve cardiac electrical and mechanical function, even in the setting of structural heart disease.
