ABSTRACT
Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) occurs when the effective oriﬁce area (EOA) of the prosthetic valve is too small in relation to a patient’s body size, thus resulting in high residual postoperative pressure gradients across the prosthesis. Severe PPM occurs in 2% to 20% of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is associated with 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in the risk of mortality and heart failure rehospitalization. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of the role of multimodality imaging in the assessment, prediction, prevention, and management of PPM following AVR. The risk of PPM can be anticipated at the time of AVR by calculating the predicted indexed from the normal reference value of EOA of the selected prosthesis and patient’s body surface area. The strategies to prevent PPM at the time of surgical AVR include: 1) implanting a newer generation of prosthetic valve with better hemodynamic; 2) enlarging the aortic root or annulus to accommodate a larger prosthetic valve; or 3) performing TAVR rather than surgical AVR. The identiﬁcation and quantitation of PPM as well as its distinction versus prosthetic valve stenosis is primarily based on transthoracic echocardiography, but important information may be obtained from other imaging modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography. PPM is characterized by high transprosthetic velocity and gradients, normal EOA, small indexed EOA, and normal leaﬂet morphology and mobility. Transesophageal echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography are particularly helpful to assess prosthetic valve leaﬂet morphology and mobility, which is a cornerstone of the differential diagnosis between PPM and pathologic valve obstruction. Severe symptomatic PPM following AVR with a bioprosthetic valve may be treated by redo surgery or the transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure with fracturing of the surgical valve stent.

A pproximately 300,000 prosthetic heart valves are implanted each year worldwide and with aging of the population, this number is estimated to triple to over 850,000 by 2050 (1). Despite major improvements in valve implantation techniques, hemodynamics, durability, and thrombogenicity, prosthetic valves are still subject

to inherent complications. These may include structural valve dysfunction, deﬁned as permanent changes intrinsic to the prosthetic valve (i.e., wear and tear, leaﬂet disruption or calciﬁc degeneration), or nonstructural valve dysfunction from abnormalities not intrinsic to the prosthesis (i.e., paravalvular regurgitation [PVR] or malpositioning) (2).

Imaging for Predicting and Assessing PPM

Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) is considered nonstructural because it is not an intrinsic dysfunction of the prosthesis, per se. This problem indeed occurs when the size of a normally functioning prosthetic valve is too small in relation to the patient’s body size and thus to the patient’s cardiac output requirements, resulting in abnormally high transprosthetic gradients (3,4).
The prevalence of moderate PPM ranges from 20% to 70% and that of severe PPM from 2% to 20% following aortic valve replacement (AVR) (3,5–9). Transcatheter AVR (TAVR) is associated with a lower prevalence of PPM, especially severe PPM, compared with SAVR (5,9–15). Among transcatheter valves, self-expanding valves with supra-annular design are generally associated with a lower prevalence of PPM compared with balloon-expandable valves, but may be associated with somewhat higher rates of permanent pacemaker requirement and signiﬁcant PVR (16,17).
Patients with PPM have worse functional class and exercise capacity, reduced regression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, higher rate of heart failure rehospitalization, and reduced survival after SAVR when compared with patients with no PPM (5–9,18–20). Furthermore, PPM appears to have a more pronounced impact on outcomes in some speciﬁc subsets of patients such as those with pre-existing LV dysfunction or severe LV hypertrophy, concomitant mitral regurgitation, or classical or paradoxical low-ﬂow, low-gradient aortic stenosis as well as in those <65 to 70 years of age (21–23). Meta-analyses report that severe and moderate PPM is associated with a 1.8- and 1.2-fold increase in mortality, respectively (6–9).
PPM is also associated with faster structural degeneration of bioprosthetic valves following SAVR (24,25). Furthermore, recent reports of transcatheter valve implantation in failed biological SAVR (valve-in-valve procedure) suggest that pre-existing severe PPM of the failed surgical bioprosthetic valves is associated with higher incidence of high residual gradient, less recovery of patients’ functional capacity, and increased risk of mortality (26,27).
The identiﬁcation and quantitation of PPM are primarily based on Doppler echocardiography. However, other imaging modalities, such as multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), may provide important complementary information with regard to the prediction and assessment of PPM. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the role of multimodality imaging in the assessment, prediction, prevention, and management of PPM following AVR.

PREDICTION AND PREVENTION OF PPM

ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS

Because PPM results from an imbalance between the effective oriﬁce area (EOA) of the prosthetic valve and the body surface area of the patient, the parameter that is generally used for identifying PPM is the indexed valve EOA (1,2). PPM is considered not clinically signiﬁcant (i.e., absent or mild), moderate, or severe when the indexed EOA is >0.85 cm2/m2, between 0.85 and 0.64 cm2/m2, and #0.65 cm2/m2, respectively. However, the indexed EOA may overestimate the severity of PPM in obese patients (body mass index $30 kg/m2) (22,28) and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 therefore recommend using lower cutpoints of indexed EOA in obese patients (i.e., <0.70 cm2/m2 for moderate PPM and <0.55 cm2/m2 for severe PPM)

AVR = aortic valve replacement
EOA = effective oriﬁce area
LV = left ventricular
LVOT = left ventricular outﬂow tract
MDCT = multidetector computed tomography
PPM = prosthesis-patient mismatch
PVR = paravalvular regurgitation
SAVR = surgical aortic valve replacement
TAVR = transcatheter aortic valve replacement
TEE = transesophageal echocardiography
TTE = transthoracic echocardiography

(Table 1).

Given the signiﬁcant impact of PPM on survival,

functional recovery, heart failure hospitalization, and

valve durability, pre-procedural planning to avoid

PPM is of utmost importance. Severe PPM should

ideally be avoided in every patient undergoing AVR,

whereas moderate PPM should be avoided in

vulnerable subsets such as patients with depressed

LV systolic function; severe LV hypertrophy; low-

ﬂow, low-gradient aortic stenosis; or concomitant

mitral regurgitation. To implement preventive stra-

tegies, it is ﬁrst necessary to predict the required

post-AVR indexed EOA, which minimizes the risk of

clinically signiﬁcant PPM, before prosthesis implan-

tation (Figure 1).

SURGICAL AVR. To obtain the predicted indexed

EOA of surgical prosthetic valves, one needs to:

1) know the model and size of the prosthesis that the

surgeon plans to implant; 2) refer to the tables pub-

lished in the 2016 recommendations of the European

Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (4), which

include the normal EOAs for the different models and

label sizes of surgical prosthetic valves; and 3) divide

the normal EOA by the patient’s body surface area.

This process can be done intraoperatively, once the

debridement and sizing of the aortic annulus are

accomplished or preoperatively by measuring the

aortic annulus dimensions by MDCT or 3-dimensional

transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) (Figure 1).

Few studies have compared pre-procedural MDCT or

2-dimensional echocardiographic measurements to

open surgical annular sizing (29–31). The prediction of

valve size from the aortic annulus size measured by

imaging before SAVR will not take into account the excision of the valve and debridement of the annulus performed by the surgeon at the time of SAVR. Furthermore, despite recent efforts in the standardization of the labeling of prosthetic heart valve size, sizers, and sizing strategies, there are still some important discrepancies in the actual dimensions of the sizers provided by the manufacturers versus the label size of the prostheses. Once the model and size of the prosthesis to be implanted is determined, one can rapidly calculate the predicted indexed EOA and therefore estimate the risk of post-operative PPM. A predicted indexed EOA #0.65 cm2/m2 (or #0.55 cm2/m2 in obese patients) indicates a risk of severe PPM, whereas an indexed EOA #0.85 cm2/m2 (or #0.70 cm2/m2 in obese patients) is consistent with a risk of moderate PPM (Figure 1).
If severe or moderate PPM in vulnerable patients is anticipated from the calculation of the predicted indexed EOA, several preventive strategies can be considered (Figure 1):
1. The surgeon may elect to implant another model of prosthetic valve providing a larger EOA for a given aortic annulus size (e.g., a stentless or sutureless prosthesis vs. a stented prosthesis).

2. The surgeon may perform an enlargement of the aortic root or annulus to accommodate a larger size of the stented bioprosthesis. This more invasive strategy should be contemplated only if the anatomy of the aortic root is favorable and the risk-beneﬁt ratio of this concomitant procedure is considered reasonable.
3. TAVR may be considered in lieu of SAVR. For this strategy, it would be important to attempt prediction of PPM before operation. MDCT or 3-dimensional TEE is essential to identify patients with a small aortic annulus in whom it would be difﬁcult to implant a medium or large size prosthetic valve during SAVR, even with extensive debridement of the annulus (Figure 1). In such patients, TAVR may be considered. A randomized trial is currently ongoing to compare these 2 types of AVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis and a small aortic annulus (NCT03383445).
TRANSCATHETER AVR. In the context of TAVR, the ﬁnal size of the prosthesis is determined by the native annular size and not the transcatheter valve size. Importantly, a single-size transcatheter valve can be implanted in a range of annular sizes and is expanded to ﬁll the annular space (32). Indeed, a given model

This ﬁgure proposes an algorithm for the prediction and the prevention of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM). *The normal reference values of effective oriﬁce area (EOA) can be obtained from Lancellotti et al.

and label size of transcatheter aortic valve provides a larger EOA if fully deployed in a larger annulus than if somewhat underdeployed in a smaller annulus. It is thus preferable to determine the predicted

indexed EOA on the basis of the native aortic annulus size rather than label transcatheter valve size. Hahn et al. (32) recently published the normal values of EOA for the SAPIEN (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine,

If a risk of PPM, and especially severe PPM, is anticipated on the basis of the predicted indexed EOA, the options to prevent or reduce PPM are limited. One may use another model of transcatheter valve providing a larger EOA for a given annulus size, if available. In this regard, some studies suggest that, in a given aortic annulus size, the

self-expanding valves with a supra-annular design provide somewhat larger EOAs than balloonexpandable valves do. A high implant depth may also help to optimize the EOA for both self- and balloon-expandable valves. Intraprocedural balloon post-dilatation has been associated with larger EOA and could be considered (33,34). However, one should carefully weigh in the risk-beneﬁt ratio of the PPM preventive strategies. For the same degree of severity, PPM likely has less impact on outcomes than PVR does. Hence, the prevention of PPM in the context of

regurgitation related to ﬁbrocalciﬁc degeneration of valve leaﬂets. However, patients with high transprosthetic gradients related, in large part, to preexisting PPM have worse outcomes following the valve-in-valve procedure. This context refers to the analogy of the Russian dolls, in which implanting a second valve within a ﬁrst valve that is inherently too small for the patient’s body size (and thus cardiac output requirements) can only worsen the hemodynamic status and thus the clinical status of the patient. Figure 2 presents an illustrative case of such unfortunate scenario in which a symptomatic patient with high mean transprosthetic gradient (25 mm Hg) related to isolated severe PPM was treated by the valve-in-valve procedure. In this patient, the gradient increased to 40 mm Hg following the procedure because the implantation of the transcatheter valve further reduced the EOA of the surgical bioprosthesis with pre-existing severe PPM. It is thus essential to correctly identify and quantify PPM of the failed surgical bioprosthesis in patient candidates for the valve-in-valve procedure. Furthermore, in patients with high transprosthetic gradients, one should determine the etiology of the elevated gradient (i.e., PPM vs. stenosis vs. regurgitation vs. a combination of these etiologies), as discussed subsequently. To assess the presence and severity of pre-existing PPM of the surgical bioprosthesis before the valve-in-valve procedure, one can use a similar strategy as described previously for SAVR, in which the predicted indexed EOA is calculated from the normal value of EOA for the model and size of bioprosthesis implanted in the patient divided by his or her body surface area (4). Other imaging criteria to differentiate a pre-existing PPM versus an acquired stenosis of the bioprosthetic valve are presented in the following section. If a patient candidate for valve-in-valve procedure has

evidence of pre-existing PPM of the surgical bioprosthesis, the proceduralist may consider fracturing the bioprosthesis stent with an oversized noncompliant balloon (Figure 2, Video 1). This concomitant procedure indeed allows implantation a larger transcatheter valve within the surgical bioprosthesis and therefore reduces the risk of severe PPM and high residual gradients after valve-in-valve procedure (35–37). Newer generations of surgical bioprostheses, such as the INSPIRIS Resilia aortic valve (Edwards Lifesciences) with expandable frame might allow the implanter to place a larger transcatheter valve at the time of valve-in-valve procedure without the need of stent fracturing. However, the potential beneﬁt of this new feature of the INSPIRIS bioprosthetic valve frame for future valve-in-valve procedures remains to be demonstrated. The implantation of a transcatheter valve with supra-annular design with a high implant depth (0 to 2 mm below the bioprosthesis stent) may also help to optimize the EOA and minimize residual gradients following the valve-in-valve procedure in patients with pre-existing PPM (27,38,39). The challenges raised by pre-existing PPM in the context of the valve-in-valve procedure also emphasize the importance of preventing PPM at the time of the initial SAVR and therefore providing the largest possible EOA “reserve” for future valve-in-valve procedures.
ASSESSMENT OF PPM AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS WITH PROSTHETIC VALVE STENOSIS
It is relatively frequent to measure a high gradient across a prosthetic aortic valve and the differential diagnosis is much more complex than for native aortic valve stenosis (Central Illustration). There are indeed several potential causes of an elevated

stenosis of the prosthetic valve. However, other imaging modalities such as TEE, MDCT, or cineﬂuoroscopy may provide important complementary information, in particular on valve leaﬂets structural integrity and mobility (Figure 3). Table 1 presents the parameters and criteria that may be used to differentiate normal prosthetic valve function versus PPM versus acquired prosthetic valve stenosis (Central Illustration).
VALVE LEAFLET MORPHOLOGY AND MOBILITY BY TTE, TEE, OR MDCT. To differentiate between PPM versus prosthetic stenosis, imaging of valve leaﬂet morphology and mobility is key (Figure 3). With PPM, the valve structure and leaﬂet morphology and mobility are generally normal, whereas with bioprosthetic valve stenosis, the leaﬂets are thickened with reduced mobility (Table 1, Figure 3, Videos 2, 3, and 4). A leaﬂet thickness >2 mm is considered abnormal. However, visualization of valve leaﬂets is often suboptimal with TTE because of shadowing and reverberations caused by the prosthesis structure. TEE may improve the assessment of the leaﬂets morphology and mobility as well as the identiﬁcation of other abnormalities such as pannus, thrombus, or vegetations that may also cause obstruction of the prosthetic valve. In case of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, the leaﬂets generally harbor a diffuse hypoechogenic thickening, whereas calciﬁc leaﬂet degeneration is often characterized by irregular hyperechogenic thickening (Figure 3, Video 4). With mechanical valves, the identiﬁcation of reduced leaﬂet mobility may be difﬁcult even with TEE, especially when the impairment of mobility is subtle and symmetric (bileaﬂet mechanical valves). Cineﬂuoroscopy is a simple, fast, and low-cost imaging modality to assess the mobility of mechanical valve leaﬂets (Figure 3). The opening and closing angles of the mechanical valve leaﬂets can be measured by cineﬂuoroscopy and compared with normal reference values for the different models of valves (4). Electrocardiography synchronized contrast enhanced MDCT is also clinically useful to: 1) assess the leaﬂet mobility in bioprosthetic or mechanical valves; 2) identify and provide an assessment of the extent of valve thrombus; and 3) allow modest capacity to differentiate thrombus versus pannus (4). Noncontrast MDCT is also increasingly utilized to detect the presence of leaﬂet mineralization a marker for calciﬁc degeneration in bioprosthetic valves (Figure 3) (4,25,40). In a recent study, the presence of even a small amount of calciﬁcation within bioprosthetic valve leaﬂets on noncontrast MDCT was associated with a high risk of valve hemodynamic deterioration,

valve reintervention, and death following SAVR (41). Endocarditis may also cause obstruction of prosthetic valves. It should be noted that the mode of presentation of transcatheter valve endocarditis is often insidious and characterized by an obstructive pattern with heterogeneous thickening of valve leaﬂets, increase in gradients, and decrease in EOA (42). Vegetations and destruction of valve leaﬂets with transvalvular regurgitation are much less prevalent than in the endocarditis of surgical bioprostheses.
DOPPLER ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS. With both PPM and valve stenosis, the peak aortic jet velocity and transprosthetic gradients are elevated, and these Doppler quantitative parameters are thus of limited utility to make the differential diagnosis between these 2 conditions (Figure 3, Central Illustration).
The valve EOA measured by the continuity equation and indexed for body surface area is the key parameter to diagnose and quantitate PPM following AVR. However, it does not allow the cardiologist to differentiate PPM versus valve stenosis given that the indexed EOA is small with both conditions (Table 1). Figure 4 presents the method to measure the prosthetic valve EOA by the continuity equation method. To measure the stroke volume (i.e., numerator of the equation) in surgical and transcatheter valves, the LV outﬂow tract (LVOT) diameter and velocity should be measured just below the apical border of the stent or ring. The LVOT diameter is measured from outer border to outer border of the stent or ring (Figure 4). For measurement of LVOT ﬂow velocity, the pulsedwave Doppler sample should be placed immediately below the apical border of the stent with no valve opening or closing clicks visible. The transprosthetic ﬂow velocity is obtained by continuous-wave Doppler with careful multiwindow interrogation including the apical and right parasternal windows.
The determination of the LVOT area by TTE is challenging and subject to measurement error. To overcome this limitation, one can use the LVOT diameter measured at the end of the AVR procedure by TEE and use this value for all subsequent calculations of the stroke volume and EOA during followup. Three-dimensional imaging using 3-dimensional TEE or contrast MDCT may also be used to directly measure the LVOT area (Figure 4) (43). However, it is important to underline that the “hybrid” EOA calculated using the LVOT area measured by MDCT (before or after AVR) and the ﬂow velocities measured by Doppler yields large values of EOA compared with the echocardiography-derived EOA (43). Hence, larger cutpoint values of indexed EOA should be applied to

identify PPM when hybrid MDCT-Doppler EOA is utilized (43): 0.81 to 1.00 cm2/m2 for moderate PPM and #0.80 cm2/m2 for severe PPM (Table 1). Importantly, hybrid MDCT-Doppler EOA did not allow for better discrimination of downstream clinical risk from PPM in an intermediate risk TAVR population, suggesting that it may not be an incremental measure.
In patients with PPM, the EOA measured by the continuity equation (Figure 4) is within the normal range but the indexed EOA is small, whereas in patients with stenosis, the measured EOA is smaller than the normal reference value (Table 1, Central Illustration). Hence, it is essential to compare the measured EOA to the normal reference value of EOA for the prosthesis model, label size, or patient’s annulus size (see previous section). If the EOA measured in the patient is within Æ0.30 cm2 (or Æ1 SD) of the normal value of EOA, the valve function is considered normal. However, if the EOA is <0.30 cm2 (or 1 SD) from the normal value, one should suspect stenosis. A difference between normal EOA versus measured EOA >0.60 cm2 (or 2 SD) suggests a significant stenosis. A recommendation document from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (4) and Hahn et al. (32) report the normal mean and SD values for the surgical and transcatheter aortic valves, respectively. The Doppler velocity index is the ratio of the velocity time integral of LVOT ﬂow to velocity time integral of transprosthetic ﬂow. In patients with isolated PPM, it is generally >0.30 to 0.35, whereas in those with valve stenosis it is <0.35 (mild or moderate stenosis) or <0.25 (severe stenosis) (Table 1).
Semiquantitative parameters describing the timing of peak transprosthetic velocity may also be useful to assess valve function. In patients with normal prosthetic valve function or PPM, the timing of the peak velocity generally occurs early in systole and the ratio of acceleration time to LV ejection time is <0.32, whereas in patients with prosthetic valve stenosis, the peaking of velocity is delayed in systole and the ratio is increased (Table 1, Central Illustration) (44). The advantage of these indices is that they are independent of Doppler beam angulation in relation to ﬂow direction and they are less subject to measurement errors than EOA is. However, they are inﬂuenced by LV systolic function. For example, a patient with normally functioning aortic prosthesis and concomitant depressed myocardial contractility may nonetheless exhibit a rounded velocity contour with late velocity peaking, as we have also witnessed the same in patients with severe PPM.

CHANGES IN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS DURING FOLLOW-UP. Another key feature of prosthetic valve stenosis is deterioration in valve hemodynamics: the increase in transprosthetic velocity and gradients with concomitant decrease in EOA and Doppler velocity index from baseline (early post-AVR) to follow-up echocardiograms (Table 1, Central Illustration). This is one of the reasons why it is important to assess the baseline valve hemodynamic performance, ideally at 1-month post-AVR. The quality of the pre-discharge echocardiogram is indeed often suboptimal, especially following SAVR. PPM occurs at the time of AVR, whereas stenosis develops after AVR. Hence, in a patient with isolated PPM, the gradient is already elevated at baseline echocardiogram performed early post-AVR and it will remain stable over time. On the other hand, an increase in mean gradient $10 mm Hg with concomitant decrease in EOA (>0.30 cm2) during follow-up suggests prosthetic valve stenosis. An increase in gradient during follow-up associated with stable or increase in EOA and Doppler velocity index is generally related to an improvement in LV ejection fraction and an increase in LV outﬂow and should not be misinterpreted as a prosthetic valve stenosis. An increase in mean gradient $20 mm Hg with marked decrease in EOA (>0.60 cm2 or >50%) and Doppler velocity index (>40%) compared with early post AVR echocardiogram is consistent with severe prosthetic valve stenosis (Table 1, Central Illustration) (4). PPM and prosthetic valve stenosis are not mutually exclusive and many patients with high transprosthetic gradient harbor both PPM and valve stenosis.
MANAGEMENT OF PPM
Patients with evidence of PPM, especially severe PPM, should receive close clinical and imaging follow-up, as they are at higher risk for accelerated structural valve deterioration (bioprosthetic valves), heart failure, and death. Valve reintervention may be considered if: 1) PPM is severe or associated with greater than or equal to moderate valve stenosis; 2) mean transprosthetic gradient is high ($30 to 35 mm Hg); or 3) the patient develops heart failure symptoms or LV systolic dysfunction (45). In patients with surgical prosthetic valves, the following options may be considered for valve reintervention: 1) a redo surgery with replacement of the severely mismatched prosthesis by a new prosthetic valve with larger size or better hemodynamic performance (and thus with larger EOA); or 2) transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure using a self-expanding valve with supra-annular design and fracturing of

the stent of the surgical bioprosthetic valve (Figure 2). In patients with transcatheter valves, PPM is less frequent and less severe and the options to correct PPM are more limited. A “transcatheter valve in transcatheter valve” procedure using a larger valve and overexpansion of the ﬁrst valve may be considered (40), but this approach needs further validation. The transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure is not an option in patients having surgical mechanical prosthetic valves with severe PPM. The only option in such case is a redo surgery, but the risk-beneﬁt ratio of reintervention should be carefully assessed.
CONCLUSIONS
PPM is a frequent sequela of AVR, which is associated with increased risk of structural valve degeneration, heart failure hospitalization, and mortality. PPM is less frequent and less severe following transcatheter versus SAVR. The risk of PPM can be anticipated before AVR by calculating the predicted indexed from the normal reference value of EOA of the prosthesis and patient’s body surface area. The strategies to prevent PPM at the time of SAVR include: 1)

implanting a newer generation of prosthetic valve with better hemodynamic; 2) enlarging the aortic annuls or root to accommodate a larger prosthetic valve; or 3) performing TAVR rather than SAVR. The identiﬁcation and quantitation of PPM as well as its distinction versus prosthetic valve stenosis is primarily based on TTE, but important information may be obtained from other imaging modalities such as TEE and MDCT (Central Illustration). PPM is characterized by high transprosthetic velocity and gradients, normal EOA, small indexed EOA, and normal leaﬂet morphology and mobility. Severe symptomatic PPM following AVR with a bioprosthetic valve may be treated by redo surgery or transcatheter valve-invalve procedure with cracking of the surgical valve stent.
