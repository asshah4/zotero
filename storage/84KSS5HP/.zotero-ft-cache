Does This Patient Have Ascites?

How to Divine Fluid in the Abdomen

CLINICAL SCENARIOS\p=m-\DOTHESE PATIENTS HAVE ASCITES?
In each of the following cases, the
clinician will need to determine whether
the patient has ascites. Case 1: A 44\x=req-\ year-old cirrhotic man is admitted with
fever but has no obvious source of in-
fection. Case 2: A 57-year-old woman
presents with an adnexal mass and re-
cent weight gain but otherwise feels well. Case 3: A 65-year-old man with a history of prior myocardial infarction is admitted for decreased exercise tolerance, increased abdominal girth, and ankle
edema.
WHY IS THIS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ANSWER WITH A CLINICAL EXAMINATION?
Free fluid in the abdominal cavity is
ascites. Ascites is a symptom that may
have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. When clinically detectable, ascites may indicate underlying heart failure, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, or malignancy. In patients with liver disease, ascites has prognostic significance since operative mortality is increased and overall survival is decreased; ascites may also signal metastases in patients with malig¬ nancy.1 Although patients with small amounts of ascites do not generally re¬ quire specific therapy, patients with larger amounts of ascites may require

intervention to relieve symptoms caused by their distended abdomen. Further¬ more, the degree of ascites is useful in monitoring the efficacy of treatment for the underlying condition that caused it (eg, monitoring response to chemother¬ apy for malignancy).
See also pp 2638 and 2650.
The three clinical scenarios are spe¬
cific examples of why ascites detection is clinically important. For example, as¬ cites detection in the first patient may lead to the diagnosis of spontaneous bac¬ terial peritonitis as the source of the patient's fever. If ascites is found by clinical examination, the physician may be able to proceed directly to abdominal paracentesis without pausing for imag¬ ing procedures. In the second patient, the presence of ascites would heighten the clinician's suspicion of ovarian car¬ cinoma with peritoneal metastasis, im¬ plying a more advanced stage and poorer prognosis. In the third patient, the find¬ ing of ascites may trigger the physi¬ cian's consideration of diagnostic possi¬
bilities other than severe left-sided con¬
gestive heart failure, such as a pericardial effusion causing marked signs of right-sided heart failure. Clearly, clini¬
cal determination of the presence or ab¬
sence of ascites has the advantages of speed, convenience, and cost savings on diagnostic imaging.
It is easy to identify large volumes of ascites clinically, but smaller amounts
of ascites are not as obvious. When di¬
agnostic confirmation is necessary, para¬ centesis is the definitive test, although less invasive radiographie procedures are ordinarily used to corroborate the

clinicians' suspicion. Ultrasonography
can detect as little as 100 mL of abdom¬
inal fluid and is considered the gold stan¬ dard for diagnosing ascites.2·3 Abdomi¬ nal computed tomography can also de¬
tect small amounts of fluid but is more
expensive. Unfortunately, there are no general guidelines for correlating small
amounts of ascites seen on ultrasound
examination or computed tomography with pathophysiologic conditions.
The "reference standard" for ascites is fluid aspiration by paracentesis and fluid visualization by ultrasound or computed tomography.
Pathophysiology of Ascites Understanding the pathophysiologic
basis for ascites facilitates assessment
of each patient's risk by alerting the examiner to conditions disrupting nor¬ mal physiology (Table 1). Under phys¬ iologic conditions, intravascular and extravascular hydrostatic and colloid os¬ motic pressures are balanced, prevent¬ ing accumulation of extravascular fluid.4

Any process disrupting this balance may precipitate ascites. For example, fibrotic constriction ofthe hepatic sinusoids sec¬ ondary to alcoholic cirrhosis leads to in¬ creased venous hydrostatic pressure and ultimately to ascites by forcing lymphatic drainage into the abdomen through the hepatic capsule.1 Importantly, cirrhotic patients with ascites show avid renal
retention of sodium and water, which is
an important mechanism for continued ascites formation.5 A second, less im¬ portant mechanism for ascites forma¬
tion is a loss of osmotic pressure due to
inadequate protein synthesis (eg, mal¬ nutrition, liver disease) or protein wast¬ ing (eg, the nephrotic syndrome). As a result of protein loss, transudative fluid
moves from the intravascular space into the abdominal extravascular space to
balance hydrostatic and osmotic forces. Finally, infection or malignancy in the peritoneum may produce inflammatory exudates or malignant effusions in the
abdominal extravascular space faster
than it can be absorbed intravascularly.

How to Elicit the Symptoms and Signs of Ascites
A complete evaluation for ascites in¬ cludes a focused history and physical
examination. The examiner should ask
about recent ankle edema, weight gain, or change in abdominal girth. Other po¬ tentially important items are a history of liver disease or congestive heart fail¬ ure. A focused physical examination for ascites includes (1) inspection for bulg¬ ing flanks, (2) percussion for flank dull¬ ness, (3) a test for shifting dullness, and
(4) a test for a fluid wave.
Bulging flanks occur when the weight
of abdominal free fluid is sufficient to
push the flanks outward (Fig 1). How¬
ever, it is sometimes difficult to distin¬
guish bulging flanks caused by ascites from bulging flanks caused by obesity. One method for discriminating between
the two is to test for flank dullness. With
the patient recumbent, gas-filled loops of bowel will characteristically float on top of ascites, making the percussion note tympanitic at the umbilicus and

dull beyond the fluid meniscus into the flanks (Fig 2). The examiner can con¬ firm this pattern by progressively per¬ cussing the abdomen, beginning at the umbilicus and moving toward the flanks, listening for the transition from tym¬
pany to dullness when the meniscus is
reached.6 Having identified and marked the transition between tympany and dullness, further evidence for ascites can be obtained by testing for shifting dull¬ ness. This is done by rolling the patient away from the examiner and repeating the percussion. With ascites, the area of dullness shifts to the dependent side, and the area of tympany shifts toward the top (Fig 3).
Another potentially useful method for detecting ascites is testing for a fluid wave. The test is performed by having the patient, or an assistant, place the medial edges of both hands firmly down
the midline of the abdomen to block
transmission of a wave through subcu¬ taneous fat (Fig 4). The examiner taps one flank sharply while using the fin-

gertips to feel for an impulse on the opposite flank. When ascites is present, an impulse may be felt in the receiving hand after a barely perceptible lag.
Two additional maneuvers, the pud¬ dle sign and auscultatory percussion, cannot currently be recommended. The puddle sign was initially advocated be¬ cause of its purported high sensitivity.7 However, it is infrequently used now because it is difficult to perform prop¬ erly and has low sensitivity (43% to 55%).8,9 A method of auscultatory per¬ cussion was described by Guarino,10 but its precision and accuracy have not yet been reported. After voiding, the pa¬
tient sits or stands so that free fluid
gravitates to the pelvis, and the exam¬ iner places a stethoscope in the midline, immediately above the pubic crest. Fin¬ ger-flicking percussion is performed along radial spokes from the subcostal margin downward toward the pelvis. The percussion note is initially dull, but changes sharply to a loud note at the border of increased pelvic density. In the absence of ascites, the border is ap¬ proximately 4.5 cm above the pelvic crest (the pelvic baseline). In patients with ascites, free fluid raises the demarcat¬ ing border clearly above the pelvic base¬ line. When the patient is supine, this
clear line of demarcation is obliterated
because the free fluid gravitates to the
flanks.
Although most of the physical exam¬
ination for ascites should focus on the
abdomen, extra-abdominal signs may provide evidence for conditions associ¬ ated with ascites. Physical findings that may be useful by their presence or ab¬
sence include evidence of liver disease
(eg, jaundice, spider angiomas) or heart disease (eg, cardiac gallop).
ACCURACY OF HISTORY AND SYMPTOMS FOR ASCITES
We examined the effect of medical
history items on the probability of as¬ cites in male veteran inpatients (Table 2).8 Medical histories, obtained by in¬ ternal medicine house staff, were com¬ pared with reference standard abdom¬ inal ultrasound findings. Positive histo¬ ries of hepatitis or heart failure gener¬
ated likelihood ratios (LRs) of 3.2 and
2.04, respectively. However, alcoholism (LR+, 1.44) or a history of carcinoma
(LR +, 0.91) had little effect on the odds
of ascites.
Other questions about the patient's present illness may be even more use¬ ful. In this same study, the patient's symptoms ofincreased abdominal girth, weight gain, or ankle edema gave LR+s of 4.16, 3.2, and 2.8, respectively. The absence of increased abdominal girth (LR-, 0.17) or ankle swelling (LR-,

0.10) decreased appreciably the diag¬
nostic likelihood of ascites. For exam¬
ple, in a patient with a low pretest prob¬ ability of ascites (<20%), the absence of recent ankle edema decreases the prob¬ ability of ascites to less than 2.5%! Clearly, the patient's past medical his¬
tory and current symptoms are valu¬ able for at least two reasons. First, cer¬ tain items may suggest the presence or absence of ascites. Second, in patients suspected of having ascites, a focused
physical examination for ascites is needed. The clinical history distin¬ guishes patients with high and low prob¬ abilities for ascites. Ascites is unlikely when patients report no increase in ab¬ dominal girth, and ascites is very un¬ likely in male patients who report no history of recent ankle swelling.
PRECISION OF THE SIGNS FOR ASCITES
Six gastroenterologists examined 50 hospitalized alcoholic patients for the
presence or absence of ascites. Their
overall agreement was good (intraclass correlation, 0.75), and it was excellent

among senior physicians (0.95).u In an¬ other study, 90 veteran inpatients with
evidence of liver disease were examined
by three internists for four signs of as¬ cites. For each sign there was good agreement: presence or absence of ab¬ dominal distention (86%), bulging flanks (79%), shifting dullness (78%), and de¬ tection ofprominent fluid waves (76%).12 There is good agreement among physi¬ cians on the presence or absence of tra¬ ditional signs for ascites.
ACCURACY OF SIGNS FOR ASCITES
Three investigations have compared physical examination findings for ascites with findings from reference standard
abdominal ultrasound examinations.8'9'12
Despite the varied levels of training (in¬ ternal medicine interns to staff gastro¬ enterologists), the results were similar in each study (Table 3). There was no single sign for ascites that was both sen¬ sitive and specific. However, flank dull¬ ness (>80%) and bulging flanks (>72%) were sensitive in all studies. Shifting dullness had a high sensitivity (>83%)

in two investigations. The puddle sign, purported to be the most sensitive test for ascites, performed poorly, yielding at best a sensitivity of 55%. The absence of a fluid wave was the only sign with a high specificity (82% to 92%) across all studies. Shifting dullness was highly spe¬ cific in only one study8; inconsistent re¬
sults may be due to differences in the
study populations (general medical vs patients with liver disease). To date, no investigator has studied how to best use these signs in combination.
The clinician must know the pretest
probability or prevalence of disease to apply sensitivity and specificity data to an individual patient. The likelihood ra¬ tios for the physical examination signs from the three studies are displayed in Table 4. We combined the study results based on the number of unique patients

most difficult clinical scenario. In the
study by Simel et al,8 examiners cate¬ gorized the probability ofascites as high, intermediate, or low. Examiners at all levels of training (intern through chief resident) were accurate when assigning a high probability of ascites (LR + , 37.7
to 83.3) but were less accurate at low
probability of ascites (LR-, 0.77 to 0.87). Apparently a high suspicion of ascites in hospitalized patients was sufficient to make the diagnosis, but a low suspicion was not enough to rule out ascites. This rule may not apply for outpatients.
Following are three guidelines on which symptoms and signs are the most useful in determining whether a patient
has ascites:
1. The most useful findings for ruling out ascites are negative histories of an¬ kle swelling or increased abdominal girth, and the inability to demonstrate bulging flanks, flank dullness, or shift¬ ing dullness.
2. The most powerful findings for making the diagnosis of ascites are a positive fluid wave, shifting dullness, or peripheral edema.
3. The puddle sign is difficult to per¬ form and uncomfortable for patients and
is not sensitive to small amounts of as¬
cites. It should not be performed.
