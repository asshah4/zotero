<h1>The Language Instinct:
<br>The New Science of Language and Mind</h1>

<div class="main">

As the title suggests, Pinker's <em>The Language Instinct</em> supports the
theory that language is innate and that humans have a common "universal
grammar".  This is a major theme of his book.  Another is the
correction of common misconceptions about language and the refutation
of popular "factoids" with no basis in reality.  (A whole chapter is
devoted to refuting the arguments of language "mavens", pedants who
worry more about normative grammatical rules than clear writing or the
realities of human language.)  But <em>The Language Instinct</em> is actually
a fairly comprehensive introduction to linguistics.
<p>

Pinker begins with a quick survey of the most obvious evidence for the
innateness of language &mdash; the growth of <a href="http://dannyreviews.com/h/Pidgins_Creoles.html">creoles from pidgins</a>, the
existence of sign languages, the even distribution of language ability,
and studies of brain-damaged speakers.  He also considers the
relationship between language and thought, arguing against claims for a
strong dependence of the latter on language.  This is followed by three
chapters on the core of linguistics &mdash; one on generative grammar, one
on matters lexical and morphological, and one on phonetics and
phonemics.  Another chapter describes attempts to automate aspects of
language (such as parsing and speech recognition) and the unexpected
difficulties encountered.
</p><p>

If human language is innate, then why is there such a variety of
languages?  Pinker devotes a chapter to exploring the ways in which
languages vary, the ways in which they change with time, and some of
the attempts at reconstruction of human linguistic history (including a
reasonably even-handed appraisal of Greenbergian lumping).  Separate
chapters are devoted to language acquisition by infants, to the
biological (genetic and ontogenetic) underpinnings of language, and to
the evolution of language.  Here Pinker disagrees with Chomsky, seeing
no problems with a selective explanation for the evolution of language.
The final chapter touches on other aspects of the human mind which seem
likely candidates for innate "modules" and examines their relationship
to linguistic competence.
</p><p>

Pinker has a great sense of humour and his tone is almost chatty, with
illustrative examples taken from newspaper headlines, Yiddish jokes,
the Watergate tapes, literary texts, and an assortment of other places.
But his anecdotal bent never obscures his argument and <em>The Language
Instinct</em> provides clear explanations of a number of quite difficult
topics.  Though it is aimed at (and is certainly accessible to) a
general audience, it could also be used as an introductory textbook.
It is simply the best popular work on linguistics around: if you are only
going to read one book on the subject then Pinker's should be the one.
