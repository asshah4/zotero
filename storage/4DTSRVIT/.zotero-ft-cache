Big data analytics to improve cardiovascular care: promise and challenges

John S. Rumsfeld1,2, Karen E. Joynt3,4 and Thomas M. Maddox1,2
Abstract | The potential for big data analytics to improve cardiovascular quality of care and patient outcomes is tremendous. However, the application of big data in health care is at a nascent stage, and the evidence to date demonstrating that big data analytics will improve care and outcomes is scant. This Review provides an overview of the data sources and methods that comprise big data analytics, and describes eight areas of application of big data analytics to improve cardiovascular care, including predictive modelling for risk and resource use, population management, drug and medical device safety surveillance, disease and treatment heterogeneity, precision medicine and clinical decision support, quality of care and performance measurement, and public health and research applications. We also delineate the important challenges for big data applications in cardiovascular care, including the need for evidence of effectiveness and safety, the methodological issues such as data quality and validation, and the critical importance of clinical integration and proof of clinical utility. If big data analytics are shown to improve quality of care and patient outcomes, and can be successfully implemented in cardiovascular practice, big data will fulfil its potential as an important component of a learning health-care system.

Over the past several decades, major advances in thera­ pies for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease have been made. At the same time, the focus on measuring and studying the ‘end results of health care’ — or how cardiovascular treatment and preven­ tion therapies are delivered in clinical practice and their associated patient outcomes and costs — has grown1. Unfortunately, these investigations have consistently demonstrated both gaps in quality of care and high vari­ ation in patient outcomes and costs of care1–4. Neither gaps in quality nor outcome variability are explained by differences in patient case mix, and higher costs of health care do not necessarily correlate with higher q­ uality of care or better patient outcomes3,4.
Efforts to improve these deficiencies have been ­stymied, in part, by inconsistent availability and use of data about how cardiovascular care is delivered and the resultant outcomes. In 2012, the US Institute of Medicine released a report entitled Best Care at Lower Cost, which argued that insights from research are poorly ­managed, the available evidence is poorly used, and the care experi­ence is poorly captured, resulting in missed opportunities, wasted resources, and poten­ tial harm to patients5 (FIG. 1). The report called for the

development of a ‘learning health-care system’ in which evidence informs practice, and practice informs evi­ dence in an iterative, virtuous cycle. However, in order to ­realize an optimal learning health-care system, effective use of data is essential.
The availability of data that could inform a learn­ ing health-care system has increased remarkably. The amount of health-care data in the USA alone is rapidly approaching zetabyte levels (1021 bytes of data)6. This exponential growth in data availability is anticipated to continue as electronic health records and other emerg­ ing data sources, such as patient-­reported outcomes, wear­able devices, data derived from Internet use, and genomic information, expand. In addition, important advances in computational capacity and data science that can support the rapid analysis of large, diverse datasets have accompanied this increase in data availability.
The confluence of increasing data availability, analy­ tical capabilities, and the pressing need to improve health-care quality and patient outcomes have created the ‘big data analytics’ (BDA) era in health care. BDA have been used outside of the health-care setting by companies such as Amazon and Netflix to improve sales and efficiency7,8. This use of big data has raised hope

Key points
• The availability of big data analytical tools for use in cardiovascular practice and research will grow rapidly
• Big data analytical applications, such as predictive models for patient risk and resource use, have great potential to improve cardiovascular quality of care and patient outcomes
• Big data analytical tools in cardiovascular care are still at a nascent stage of development and evaluation, and evidence showing they improve quality of care and patient outcomes is lacking
• Establishing the ‘evidence base’ for big data applications in relation to cardiovascular quality and outcomes of care is critical; big data analytical tools should be evaluated as health-care delivery interventions
• Big data methods are tolerant of poor quality of underlying data; however, big data tools might be more valid and clinically useful in cardiovascular care when based on higher quality data
• Substantial attention and resources will be required to integrate big data analytical applications optimally into cardiovascular practice, and to monitor their effect on care and outcomes

that BDA can be applied successfully in health care, with recog­nition that the targeted outcomes of other indus­ tries are not the same as health-care outcomes. When applied to cardiovascular care, BDA can be generally defined as combining and analysing large amounts of data to identify associations and make predictions that can inform improvements in quality of cardiovascular-­ care delivery and patient outcomes (FIG. 2). BDA appli­ cations have great potential both to improve health-care outcomes and to reduce waste in health-care resources, thereby improving the value of health care. Estimates of the potential savings from the use of BDA applications, such as predictive models, to inform health-care deliv­ ery are in the many billions of dollars per year in the USA alone6.
One oft-cited example of the promise of BDA in health care is the 2009 Nature publication that used Google search queries to predict the spread of influenza9. By applying advanced analytics to Internet search data that reflected health-seeking behaviours, the Google model could predict the spread of influenza in a more rapid and accurate manner than the US Centers for Disease Control model, which was dependent on reports of influenza cases submitted from health clinics and

hospitals. In a manner typical for BDA modelling, the data ‘inputs’ for the Google models were not constrained to specific variables or health-specific data; rather, the statistical models optimized prediction on the basis of all available data9. However, this example also serves as a cautionary tale about the challenges of using BDA in health care. After the initial success of the Google mod­ els, the accuracy of these models in predicting influenza faltered, partly owing to unstable associations between Internet search terms and influenza rates over time10. Furthermore, understanding the reasons behind these unstable associations is difficult because the BDAgenerated associations are correlative and not causal in nature. Finally, no evidence demonstrated that the Google influenza prediction models led to ­interventions that improved health outcomes.
The potential for utilizing BDA to improve cardio­ vascular care is tremendous, but evidence that BDA will translate into better quality of care and patient outcomes is currently lacking. Accordingly, the primary goal of this Review is to describe the main components of BDA and the potential applications of these analyses to improve cardiovascular care delivery. In addition, this Review will delineate the principal challenges facing BDA in health care, including the need for evidence showing that the outputs of BDA can be successfully integrated into cardio­vascular care, and that the use of BDA will not lead to unintended consequences and will improve outcomes.
Big data sources and analytics
A universally accepted definition of what constitutes big data does not exist. However, big data is often defined by the three ‘Vs’, namely the volume, variety, and velo­city of data6,11. Volume is the amount of data in a data set. The volume for big data does not have a standard definition, but most data sets contain at least 1 petabyte (1015 bytes) of data. Variety in big data typically comes from com­ bining data from multiple sources, including diverse data types that can include both structured and unstruc­ tured data. Finally, big data is characterized by the speed of combining and analysing large data sets to yield timely information. Such velocity is essential for real-world applications of big data sets, such as p­ rediction models for patient outcomes.
A general overview of BDA, including examples of data sources and analytical methods, is provided in FIGURE 2 and TABLE 1. In theory, the number or variety of data sources that can be used for BDA is not constrained. At present, major sources of data for big data applica­ tions in cardiovascular medicine — and in health care overall — include administrative databases (for e­ xample, claims for services and pharmaceuticals), clinical regis­ tries, and electronic health record data. Additional data sources are increasingly available, such as bio­metric and other data received directly from patients (for example, derived from wearable or other technologies), patient-reported data (for example, from standardized health surveys), data derived from Internet use such as social media, medical imaging data, and biomarker data, including all the spectrum of ‘omics’ data (that is, genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data).

these sources has strengths and limitations (TABLE 1). These additional sources of data, as well as a variety of other potential data sources, are likely to grow rapidly in the coming years, and will increasingly be incorporated into big data applications in the future12.
Advances in computational capacity and computer science have led to the development of analytical plat­ forms that can accommodate, link, and analyse large, diverse data sets. One example of a BDA platform is Apache Hadoop, an open-source software framework that enables distributed data processing for the organ­ ization, transformation, and analysis of ‘big data’ data sets. Distributed data processing, which harnesses the computing power of multiple machines at once by split­ ting large data sets and analyses into smaller pieces that can be performed in parallel rather than in series, is one among many approaches to making big data function­ ally useful. The details of big data platforms, linkage of diverse data sources, and analytical applications are beyond the scope of this Review, but have been nicely summarized by Raghupathi and Raghupathi6.
Generally, BDA implies the use of data science meth­ ods, such as data mining or machine learning, that are not traditional, hypothesis-driven statistical methods. Some of the commonly used BDA methods include clus­ ter analyses, decision-tree learning, Bayesian networks, natural language processing, graph analytics, and other data visualization approaches. BDA is generally not focused on causal inference, but rather on correlation or on identifying patterns amid complex data. For exam­ ple, BDA predictive modelling places no constraint on variable selection for consideration in modelling.
This movement towards more correlative types of analysis, which seek patterns in data sets while remain­ ing agnostic to specific predictors, can be considered a hallmark of BDA. However, many published studies that are described or labelled as using big data util­ ize more traditional statistical methods (for example, logistic regression) with large data sources, reflecting a

broader definition of health-care analytics. In addition, the superior­ity of using big data methods, such as data ­mining, instead of traditional statistical methods for health-care analytical applications is not established. Therefore, this Review includes examples of both types of studies, and notes where both big data and more tradi­tional statistical approaches were compared in the same study.
Big data applications: the promise The mere presence of large databases and innovative analytical tools does not fulfil the promise of big data to improve cardiovascular practice. Rather, the promise of BDA lies in the insights generated from these data­ bases and analyses, which have the power to inform and improve health-care delivery and patient out­ comes. This improvement is accomplished through BDA applications, or tools, such as predictive models of health-care outcomes, business intelligence outputs, or other reports relevant to health-care operations or quality. The potential uses of BDA tools to improve cardio­vascular care and outcomes traverse the spectrum from individual patient care, such as tailoring speci­ fic therapeutic decisions, to guiding the efficient use of resources in large health-care systems, or to ­public health ­applications (FIG. 2).
Predictive modelling Currently, one of the most common BDA tools in health care is predictive models to identify high-risk or highcost patients7. Identifying these patients accurately and rapidly might facilitate more effective and efficient care. The publications in the medical literature in support of these goals are limited, but a number of studies pub­ lished in the past 5 years exemplify the potential for BDA tools to predict patient risk and resource use to inform cardiovascular practice7,13–27 (TABLE 2). These stud­ ies demonstrate both the potential for, and the nascent literature on, the use of BDA for predictive modelling.

Population management
The published literature on BDA tools for population management, including case-finding applications, is small and preliminary in nature, but population manage­ ment could be a major application for big data in health care. Population management is generally defined as the proactive monitoring of a population of patients that are cared for by a clinical, hospital, or health system. Case

finding is the process of conducting a systematic search for patients or populations at risk of a particular condi­ tion, rather than waiting for the condition to manifest. Such techniques are of increasing relevance in healthcare reforms, particularly with value-based payment models such as the US Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and the proliferation of alternative payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations28.

As examples of BDA tools applied to population manage­ment, methods such as natural language process­ ing, machine-learning, or electronic case-finding algo­ rithms can be applied to electronic health record data to identify patients who are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, have manifest cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus that might or might not yet be diagnosed, or to identify progression of cardio­ vascular risk factors over time29–32. Similarly, case find­ ing for heart failure signs and symptoms or to diagnose heart failure (for example, by Framingham diagnostic criteria) using electronic health record data and applying BDA methods has been demonstrated, at least as proof of concept33,34. The feasibility of evaluating national-level data from intracardiac electrograms from implantable cardioverter–defibrillators to classify and detect types of arrhythmias has also been reported35.
Early detection of undiagnosed, untreated, or pro­ gressive cardiovascular risks or disease can inform earlier diagnosis and intervention. In turn, this early detection might improve patient outcomes and cost-­ effectiveness of care. However, evidence demonstrating this potential influence is currently lacking.
Drug and medical device surveillance
Another promising use of BDA tools is drug and med­ ical device surveillance36–39. Big data offers the potential to evaluate large volumes of electronic health record,

medical device, clinical registry, social media, and patient-reported data for drug or device safety sig­ nals40. Cardiovascular therapeutics will probably be a major focus of BDA surveillance applications, given the large number of medications and devices (for example, implanted pacemakers and defibrillators, and coronary stents) used to treat cardiovascular disease.
Disease and treatment heterogeneity
Cardiovascular diseases are heterogeneous in nature. A diagnosis of heart failure, for example, belies the wide range of phenotypes of the disease and comorbid condi­ tions that manifest in individual patients41. By evaluating large amounts of diverse data, such as electronic health record, imaging, and ‘omics’ data, BDA might reveal distinct disease phenotypes that can indicate differential therapies. Initial studies on ‘phenomapping’, or defining distinct groups of patients, utilizing BDA methods such as machine learning and natural language processing are promising42,43.
Medical treatment heterogeneity — or the response of individual patients or subgroups of patients to medications, or the differential outcomes of medical procedures — is also a critical issue for the future of health care44. The BDA approaches to disease hetero­ geneity described above have the potential to identify patient subgroups with differential risks and benefits for ­medical therapies.

Prescriptive analytics
In addition to the predictive models for patient risk and resource use, BDA can inform prescriptive analy­ tics, as embodied by the concepts of precision medicine and clinical decision support. Prescriptive analytics can inform medical therapeutic decisions for individual patients by providing estimates of the risks and benefits of medical therapies for a given patient. To date, we are not aware of published studies on BDA tools to inform prescriptive analytics for cardiovascular care, but the potential is great.
In precision medicine, BDA are well-suited to be applied to the size and complexity of ‘omic’ data. The broader concept of precision medicine is tailoring specif­ic medical therapies to optimize the benefit– risk ­equation for a given patient. Big data approaches can facilitate the integration of ‘omics’ with other data sources, integrat­ing genotypic with phenotypic data in analytical consideration and, thereby, providing the ‘engine’ for precision medicine applications45.
Predictive models based on BDA that estimate the benefits of medical therapeutics for individual patients can be embedded in clinical decision support tools inte­ grated with electronic health records, web or smartphone applications, or other delivery platforms. The analytics can be based on the results from clinical trials and/or on observational data from clinical registry programmes or electronic health records46. An important aspect to note here is that prescriptive analytics that are based on observational data will be subject to the inherent limit­ ations of such data (for example, treatment selection bias and unmeasured confounding). Therefore, clinical deci­ sion support tools based on observational data will need rigorous validation, both to determine their efficacy and to evaluate any potential unintended consequences.
Quality of care and performance measures
BDA can potentially be used to support quality-of-care measurement by leveraging large and diverse data sources to provide timely estimation of quality of care metrics or performance measures45,47. The publications in the medical literature in support of this concept are scant so far, although one study demonstrated the feas­ ibility of automated extraction of heart failure perfor­ mance measures from clinical documents48. Although BDA can support quality measurement, caution should be taken in the use of electronic health record data to estimate performance measures, because BDA has the potential to misrepresent actual clinical performance49.
Public health
In cardiovascular disease, very few published exam­ ples demonstrate the potential for public-health appli­ cations of BDA. One study showed Internet search query surveillance methods to track the rise in the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems as an example of tracking health products related to cardiovascular risk50. BDA methods could also support both tracking of cardio­vascular risk factors and disease patterns, as well as potential associations between cardiovascular disease and exposures such as air pollution51. Geocoded

data as a source for BDA might improve targeting of community and health resources for patients. Murdoch and Detsky have proposed that BDA might be wellsuited to combine medical data with social media data to target public-­health messages more efficiently (for example, about smoking or exercise), which could lead to more effective ­public-health campaigns to reduce cardiovascular risk45.
Big data research
All the potential BDA applications discussed so far have research relevance. However, the use of BDA tools in research, such as those related to predictive models for risk and resource use, population management, drug and medical device surveillance, disease and treatment heterogeneity, precision medicine and clinical decision support, quality of care, and public health applications, needs to be evaluated.
A number of entities have been developing ‘big data’ platforms or networks with the intent of supporting research that advances big data methods and evalu­ ates BDA applications in relation to quality of care and patient outcomes. Examples include the NIH’s BD2K Initiative52, CALIBER53, CANHEART54, Optum Labs55, and PCORNet , 56,57 which includes both clinical and patient-driven research networks. Wallace and colleagues proposed the use of big data research platforms to address comparative effectiveness and safety, case finding, predict readmissions, assess variations in care delivery, and pre­ dict medication adherence and phenotypes of patients with multi-morbidities55. The UK Biobank Initiative58, although not specifically a big data platform, is an exam­ ple of a large cohort with genotypic and phenotypic data and longitudinal outcome data that is openly available to researchers. The US eMERGE Consortium59 is an exam­ ple of a network that leverages electronic medical record data and genomic data for research, including the goal of supporting personalized medicine analytics.
Importantly, Wallace and other investigators have also emphasized the need for research on big data methods, including how expanding data sources add to prediction, approaches to data linkages, methods for missing data, and BDA methods as a complement to hypothesis-driven research8,55. Comparative effectiveness studies and associ­ ation studies leveraging BDA, such as data mining and visualization methods, have also been published60–62. Finally, big data platforms can also be utilized to plan and execute pragmatic clinical trials46,63,64.
Challenges of big data applications Although the potential of BDA is promising, assessing the ‘state of science’ and recognizing that, at present, the application of BDA in health care is largely promis­ sory is important. As such, delineating some of the main challenges facing the implementation of BDA in ­cardiovascular practice is critical (FIG. 3).
The evidence base
Currently available articles on BDA in health care largely focus on the concepts and potential effects of these analy­ses. Published studies mostly show the

feasi­bility of development of BDA tools for potential use in cardio­vascular practice. As such, little direct evi­ dence so far demonstrates that BDA can or will improve cardio­vascular care and outcomes. The idea that the identifi­cation of high-risk or high-cost patients will lead to interventions that reduce patient risk, reduce costs, or improve outcomes cannot be assumed65. This lack of evidence strongly supports the need for more research on BDA tools in relation to cardiovas­ cular care and outcomes. Hopefully, the initial BDA research efforts, networks, and platforms described above will rapidly lead to published studies to form the evidence base s­ upporting the use of BDA tools in cardiovascular practice.
Methodological issues
A number of published articles appropriately raise methodo­logical issues that need to be addressed for BDA tools to succeed in health care8,41,56,63,66–68. Important issues include data quality, data inconsistency or stabil­ ity, the limitations of observational data, validation and other analytical limitations, and patient privacy, consent, and other potential legal barriers (FIG. 3).
Data quality. The use of BDA tools to inform clinical decisions raises reasonable concerns if the underlying data are of poor quality. Many sources of data to inform BDA in health care have potentially serious quality limit­ ations (TABLE 1). For example, administrative data have clear inherent limitations and electronic health records have issues of quality and data heterogeneity. Although big data approaches are tolerant of poor underlying data, their clinical utility might still very much depend on the specific use-case (that is, how BDA will be used to inform health-care decisions). Importantly, when BDA are applied to higher-quality clinical data, the results can be more valid, stable, and clinically useful41,42. Some researchers have suggested that a critical feature of big data in health care is veracity of the data, in addition to volume, variety, and velocity6.

Data inconsistency. The Google influenza model helps to illustrate that changes over time in the underlying data can degrade the performance of BDA tools. A related issue is the lack of data standards in medicine, which exacerbates the inconsistency in medical terminology in data sources. BDA tools can be regularly recalibrated to data sources. However, because BDA approaches often use ‘all available data’ and do not specify variable inputs, knowing whether they are maintaining their per­ formance over time might be difficult for clinicians and health-care administrators.
Observational data limitations. Large amounts of data do not obviate the inherent limitations of observational data. BDA are based on large, but not fully comprehen­ sive, data sources. Therefore, issues such as sampling bias inherent to patient cohorts on which BDA tools are developed, unmeasured confounding factors, and treatment selection bias are major potential threats to the validity of BDA tools.
Validation and other analytical issues. Even if initially validated, BDA tools can have major differences in per­ formance when applied prospectively in clinical care. Important concerns include missing data, potential over-fitting of prediction models, multiple comparisons, and the risk of false-positive associations. Krumholz has noted that: “False positive findings from investigations into genomic associations that started with the data are indeed an example of the hazard of pursuing knowledge about causation without theory” (REF. 8). Krumholz strongly reinforces the need for the validation of BDA tools beyond initial development, before clinicians and health-care administrators rely on them.

information need to be considered45,69. A detailed discus­ sion of these topics is beyond the scope of this Review. However, legal and regulatory aspects are potential barriers to the successful implementation of BDA appli­ cations in health care. Concerns related to these issues include, but are not limited to, inadvertent release of private patient health-care data, inappropriate access to or use of patient data, and even the potential use of data to inappropriately ‘profile’ patients and differentially provide care or health-care resources (for example, ­avoidance of highest-cost or highest-risk patients).
Clinical integration and utility BDA tools will require clinical integration to be success­ ful. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in the current literature70. Similarly to other tools such as clinical practice guidelines and clinical risk scores, the existence of BDA tools alone is very unlikely to change cardiovascular care and outcomes. BDA tools face the same implementation challenges as other health-care quality interventions, and will require the same skill sets and resources (for example, quality improvement, systems engineering, informatics, and information tech­ nology support) to be integrated successfully into the clinical workflow and achieve clinical utility.
Cardiovascular clinicians are familiar with exist­ ing risk prediction models or scores, such as the Framingham Risk Score. However, currently avail­ able cardiovascular risk models and scores are rarely implemented in routine clinical care, and evidence that they can improve outcomes is limited71,72. Whether the implementation of BDA risk models will be more effec­ tive than has been true for more traditional clinical risk models is not yet clear. The promise of BDA includes predictive models that are based on larger, more diverse data sets than traditional risk models, with potentially higher accuracy of risk prediction and available at the point of care, but these features do not guarantee ­effective clinical integration.
Box 1 | BDA in cardiovascular health care
• We will see a rapid growth in the development and availability of big data analytics (BDA) tools for potential use in cardiovascular practice and research
• The existence of BDA tools is not sufficient to justify their automatic implementation in clinical practice. Health-care stakeholders, ranging from patients and clinicians to researchers and health-care administrators, should require evidence of the effectiveness and safety of BDA tools, as for any other medical intervention
• Further research is critical to establish the ‘evidence base’. Research should span the whole spectrum, from advancing big data methods to evaluating BDA tools as health-care delivery interventions
• Although a strength of big data methods is the capacity to combine diverse data sources of variable data quality, big data applications in health care might be more valid, stable, and clinically useful when these applications are based on higher-quality data sources. Veracity of data can be as important a feature for big data in health care as volume, variety, and velocity
• Even as research on BDA tools expands, substantial attention and resources will be required to integrate BDA tools optimally into clinical practice. Practice and hospital resources, including information technology and performance improvement teams, will need to work with clinicians and administrators for the clinical integration and, later, for tracking the effect of the use of BDA tools on quality of care and patient outcomes

Moreover, most published studies of BDA models show only modest predictive accuracy, and whether these models are as good as or better than existing risk models is not clear. Therefore, the clinical utility of BDA tools must be proven. In addition, because BDA utilizes all available data to develop models, some risk of tauto­ logy exists. For example, in one study of a BDA predict­ ive model for emergency department revisit, a primary driver of the predictive model was the number of repeat visits26. When a patient returned to the emergency department multiple times, the accuracy of the model to indicate high likelihood of another visit went up. This predictive model is unlikely to be clinically useful.
Importantly, health-care interventions can have ­unintended, or unanticipated, consequences when implemented. The impressive capacity of BDA to gener­ ate predictive models might lead to an undue confidence in BDA by clinicians, health-care administrators, and other ‘consumers’ of BDA. The predictive accuracy of risk models and other BDA outputs has similar limit­ ations to currently published clinical risk scores and risk models that use more traditional statistical model­ ling approaches. This reinforces the need for evidence, valid­ation, recalibration, and vigilance by ‘consumers’ of BDA that the information being provided is not leading to unintended consequences.
Finally, many of the published studies of healthcare analytics have employed more traditional statis­ tical models rather than the analytical approaches that are most often associated with BDA, and/or have used restrained variable sets to create more clinically inter­ pretable risk models or to test specific hypotheses. Studies to compare BDA methods with more traditional approaches have found consistent or equivalent results in terms of predictive accuracy of models. One study con­ cluded that machine learning techniques “added little” to logistic regression models of hospital readmission73. A number of health-care systems, such as the Veterans Health Administration, are applying both BDA meth­ ods and more traditional approaches to their large data sources74. Amarasingham and colleagues have promoted the concept of electronic health-care predictive analytics (e‑HPA), which can use both BDA and more traditional statistical methods67. Importantly, they emphasize that “little is known about how best to incorporate e‑HPA into the work flow of a health care system; how to evalu­ ate success or protect against error” (REF. 67). Ultimately, BDA is a form of health-care analytics, and irrespec­ tive of the specific methods used, the important chal­ lenges of demonstrating a positive effect on care and outcomes, methodological issues, and clinical integra­ tion and ­utility define the principal next steps for BDA in health care.
Conclusions
Big data has tremendous potential to improve cardio­ vascular quality and outcomes of care. The amount of data available to inform cardiovascular practice and research is growing at an astounding pace. Administrative, clinical registry, and electronic health record data will increas­ ingly be merged and joined with patient-reported,

social media, biometric, ‘omic’, and other data sources. Cardiovascular clinicians and health-care administra­ tors will be challenged by the sheer amount of data, and how best to use these data for clinical management and performance improvement. Big data approaches can help with this data explosion, providing analytical tools intended to guide more efficient and effective care. The question is to what degree will BDA be able to deliver on its tremendous potential?
In concept, and in a small but growing literature, BDA tools such as predictive models should help cardio­ vascular clinicians and health-care administrators to ­tailor clinical management and resources on the basis of the identification of higher-risk and higher-cost patients. BDA should also help with the management of individ­ ual patients, as well as populations of patients, through matching of therapeutic recommendations to estimated risks and benefits of therapies, case finding, monitoring of disease progression, and improved phenotyping of the disease.
BDA is poised to advance the concepts of precision medicine and support a learning health-care system. However, the development and implementation of BDA tools for cardiovascular care is nascent, and the exist­ ing literature does not provide evidence that BDA will

translate into higher quality of health care, lower costs of care, or improved patient outcomes. In particular, the implementation in clinical practice has received little focus. The mere existence of BDA tools does not influ­ ence care or outcomes. BDA tools need to be integrated into clinical care delivery shown to have clinical utility. Methodological issues such as the validity and stability of big data predictive models when applied prospectively in cardiovascular care, and the inherent limitations of observational data such as treatment selection bias, raise the possibility that BDA tools could misinform cardio­ vascular clinicians and health-care administrators. The main conclusions of the current state of big data in rela­ tion to cardiovascular quality and outcomes of care are ­summarized in BOX 1.
The big data era in health care in general, and more specifically to improve cardiovascular quality of care and outcomes, is just beginning. Big data methods and tools will evolve, and the evidence base related to the imple­ mentation of BDA tools in cardiovascular care will grow. If BDA tools are shown to be valid when applied in cardio­ vascular practice, and they demonstrate value in terms of improving quality of care and patient outcomes, BDA tools will make good upon their potential ­contribution to the realization of a learning health-care system.
