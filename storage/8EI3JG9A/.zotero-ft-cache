Abstract
Aim Stercoral perforation is a rarely suspected lifethreatening condition. Early diagnosis is difﬁcult but essential. A comprehensive systematic review was performed to evaluate its presentation, diagnosis and treatment.
Method A systematic review was carried out of Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Cochrane databases for all articles published between 1998 and 2011. Only studies describing stercoral perforation were included.
Results Twenty-four relevant articles were found including 137 patients (median age = 62 years) with stercoral perforation, of whom 81% had chronic constipation. Stercoral perforation was diagnosed by CT scan

in 90% of 31 patients, with the commonest ﬁndings being a combination of faecal impaction (84%) and subphrenic (90%) or extraluminal air (61%). The commonest site of perforation was the sigmoid colon (50%) followed by the rectosigmoid junction (24%). The overall mortality was 34%.
Conclusion Stercoral perforation should be suspected in elderly and chronically constipated patients with unexplained abdominal pain and investigated appropriately with a CT scan to allow timely and optimal treatment.
Keywords Stercoral, stercoral perforation, rectal perforation, constipation

Introduction
Chronic constipation can lead to faecal impaction in the large bowel which can cause pressure necrosis followed by perforation, known as stercoral perforation (SP) [1]. The condition may be difﬁcult to identify. The patient is often elderly with a history of chronic constipation and presenting in a moribund state. Often the condition is not suspected and the mortality is high. In the last comprehensive review by Maurer et al. in 2000 [2], the diagnosis was rarely made preoperatively. Most patients were diagnosed during emergency laparotomy or postmortem.
Given advances in diagnostic techniques, particularly imaging, a systematic review was performed to determine the present role of radiology in aiding early diagnosis and to see whether there was any evidence from the literature of increasing awareness of the condition.
Method
A literature search was carried out using search engines including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL,

Ovid and Cochrane databases from 1998 to 2011. The key words used included ‘stercoral, perforation’, ‘perforated’, ‘perforat*’, ‘stercoral perforation’, ‘peritonitis’, ‘constipated’, ‘constipation’, ‘faecal impaction’ and ‘fecal impaction’. Only articles that speciﬁcally diagnosed a stercoral perforation were incorporated in the study. The last review included all the articles on SP to 1998 [2] and to prevent duplication we added articles published from May 1998 to December 2011. All nonEnglish papers were excluded where a translation was not available. The patient characteristics and predisposing factors for SP were assessed. The clinical and radiological ﬁndings, subsequent management and mortality rates were determined. All articles that met the selection criteria were extracted by one reviewer (SC) and the full-text articles were obtained and their references cross-checked. The type and quality of studies were noted. The cases were collated and reviewed independently by the senior authors (JNM and AC). All the available data were pooled and analysed.
Statistical analysis
All continuous data were pooled and their distribution was expressed as median and range. Individual data

A systematic review of stercoral perforation

from each article was used in this calculation. For all categorical variables, a summation of the data was performed and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients included. The SPSS version 17 statistical package was used for the statistical analysis.
Results
Thirty-seven articles were identiﬁed from the literature search, of which 24 from 1998 were found to be relevant (Fig. 1). They included case reports (n = 17) and case series of small numbers (n = 7) (Table 1), indicating only low evidence data. The case reports and case series were, however, detailed and included information on all end-points of interest with very little missing data. In the case series, individual details of each case were recorded for almost all patients. The level of evidence available did not allow for a meta analysis.

The ﬁndings are summarized in Table 2 and included 137 patients to 2011. The median age of the patients was 62 (4–106) years. The gender ratio was 1/1.3 (male/female). Chronic constipation was present in 81%. A CT scan performed in 31 patients since 1998 identiﬁed features of SP in 90%. The commonest CT ﬁndings were a combination of faecal impaction (84%), subphrenic (90%) or extraluminal (61%) air, pericolic fat stranding (55%) and extraluminal faeces (13%) (Table 3). The commonest site was the sigmoid colon (50%) followed by the rectosigmoid junction (24%). The overall mortality was 34%.
The studies consisted of low level (4 and 5) evidence and therefore a formal sensitivity analysis was not possible.
Discussion
SP perforation is rare, with only 137 cases in the literature to date. The earliest example was reported in 1894 by

Berry to the Pathological Society of London [3]. Grivalsky et al. [4] found a stercoral ulcer in 4–6% of 175 autopsies in 1 year. Maurer et al. [2] reported seven cases and performed the ﬁrst extensive review on SP. At that time, 81 cases had been reported in the surgical literature.
SP perforation is a condition commonly seen in the elderly, especially in those with chronic constipation

(81%). However, there are also reports in younger patients, all associated with long-term constipation [5]. There is an association with the long-term use of opiates, nonsteroidal antinﬂammatory drugs, tricyclic

antidepressants, hypothyroidism, diabetic enteropathy and hemiparesis [6–8], all of which predispose to constipation. Faecal impaction was found to be present in 42% of patients in a geriatric ward [9], and thus elderly, nursing home-dependent, bedridden or narcotic-dependent patients are at a high risk.
The perforations are typically circular, about 1 cm in diameter and located on the antimesenteric border of the bowel, ﬁndings which were conﬁrmed by intraoperative colonoscopy [10].

A systematic review of stercoral perforation

S. Chakravartty et al.

If peritonitis is recognized, an emergency laparotomy should be performed. Although there are a few reports of successful primary repair [11] the usual procedure is a Hartmann’s procedure with resection of the site of perforation. A primary repair may be justiﬁed where peritoneal contamination is minimal and the patient is stable [12]. Limited resection and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC), followed by a second-look procedure, have been tried with success but cannot be recommended for routine use [13].
Successful management depends on early diagnosis as the mortality is high – 34% in the present review, which is similar to that for perforated diverticular disease which can be as high as 45% in Hinchey Stage 4 disease [14]. Interestingly, not all patients have clinically evident peritonitis, as shown by Wu et al. [15], who noted that eight of 10 patients did not have any clinical signs of peritonitis on admission. Many patients will have evidence of faecal impaction in the rectum on digital examination or on abdominal radiography. It is unwise to perform an enema at this stage because this may be associated with large-bowel perforation in constipated patients [16–18].
A CT scan should be performed in a patient with the risk factors outlined in Table 4. The ﬁndings of SP include discontinuity of the bowel wall, presence of faecal material either protruding through the colonic wall or lying free within the peritoneal cavity, and extraluminal air [19]. A previous study has suggested that pericolonic stranding, perfusion defect and dense mucosa are the most sensitive CT signs of SP, as observed in about 80%, 70% and 62.5% of patients, respectively [15]. In this review the CT scan showed features suggestive of SP in 90% of cases. Subphrenic or extraluminal air was identiﬁed more commonly than from a plain ﬁlm. In patients with suspicion of SP a CT scan is therefore essential.
Constipation is present in up to 10% of the population [20] and an elderly, chronically constipated patient with increasing abdominal pain without clinical peritonitis may either be developing SP or already have it subclinically. An early CT scan will easily diagnose the condition and should lead to a decrease in the interval to surgery, which is the most important factor for reducing mortality. A simple algorithm for management of patients with chronic constipation who present with abdominal pain is given in Fig. 2.
In summary, doctors working in emergency units should be aware of the possibility of SP in elderly patients with chronic constipation and increasing abdominal pain. Imaging by plain abdominal X-ray followed by CT when the diagnosis is in doubt should be performed before the administration of enemas.
