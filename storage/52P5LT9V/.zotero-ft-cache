ABSTRACT. Plasma cortisol was measured for seven 24-hr periods using the frequent sampling technique (every 20 min) in 6 normal acclimated subjects. A defined sleep-wake schedule was established over 3-5 consecutive nights with polygraphic definition of their sleep patterns. A mean of 9 secretory episodes (range 7-13) occurred over the 24-hr sampling time, the subjects spending an average of 24% of the time in active secretion. It was estimated that, on the average, 16 mg of cortisol was secreted over the 24 hr, with a mean of 66 min half-life of cortisol decay. Although great variability was found in both the amount of cortisol secreted and the time spent in secretory activity/hr, the secretory rate was quite constant at approximately .05 mg/min. A temporal pattern of episodic secretion was recog-

nized, and the 24-hr sleep-wake cycle could be divided into 4 unequal temporal phases: Phase 1. A 6-hr period of "minimal secretory activity" (4 hr before and 2 hr after lights out); Phase 2. A 3hr period called "preliminary nocturnal secretory episode" (3rd to 5th hr of sleep); Phase 3. A 4-hr period, the "main secretory phase" (6, 7, 8 hr of sleep and 1st hr after awakening); and Phase 4. The 11 hr of "intermittent waking secretory activity." No evidence for a "basal level" or "steady state" of cortisol concentration was found. Changes in cortisol output during the 24hr day appear to be due to differences in frequency and duration of secretory episodes and not to major changes in secretory rate.

Results and Discussion
All subjects studied demonstrated a series of major fluctuations in plasma cortisol concentration throughout the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. These fluctuations were characterized by sharp rises followed by a slower, generally smooth, decline, in most cases closely following an exponential curve. Indeed, the concentration of cortisol was never constant except when the value had reached zero or near zero in the period just before and/or after the onset of sleep.

The intervals between these elevations were not regular but ranged from 40 minutes, the minimum separation detectable in our sampling paradigm, to 4 hours and 40 minutes within the period of active daytime secretion, and over 8 hours between the start of the last waking episode to the onset of the first nocturnal one (Fig. 1). In addition, the concentrations at which these rises were initiated varied greatly, beginning at values of zero up to 17 /ig/100 ml. The peak values obtained also varied over a wide range, from less than 5 to almost 20 jug/100 ml.
These findings appear to be at variance with many published studies describing the 24-hour plasma cortisol concentration as an essentially smooth (2-5) or progres-

sive "circadian" (6, 7) curve. However, when these same data are averaged for onehour intervals and for all seven studies, the resultant curve conforms quite closely to the often described deceptively smooth circadian curve (Fig. 2, top). The data obtained in this study are therefore fully consistent with those reported earlier. The introduction of the frequent sampling technique demonstrates that the averaged "circadian" function results from a combination of the frequency and amplitude of these intermittent rises. The plasma cortisol concentration was consistently elevated in all seven studies in the hour following arousal, as confirmed by the peak and small variation of the mean concentration at this time. However, similar sharp

increases often equal to or greater than these individual peaks were found during the subsequent waking period but differing by their wide spacing. During the ninehour period of the day (11-20 hr), the mean concentration curve tended to plateau, instead of demonstrating a continuous decline. Since the individual secretory episodes occurred irregularly, when averaged they therefore tended to cancel one another. Indeed, in four of the seven studies (Fig. 1), the maximum or near-maximum plasma cortisol concentration of the 24 hours was present during this portion of the waking period. Cortisol concentration does not truly begin to fall toward its minimum until the fourth hour before the start of the sleep period.

A series of 7 to 13 episodes of cortisol secretion may be defined for each of these
24-hour sampling studies. This is based on
our previous finding that cortisol is secreted during each instance of a sharp rise in plasma concentration, and not during the fall in concentration. This was demonstrated utilizing changes in the specific activity of plasma cortisol following the intravenous injection of 14C-labeled cortisol during the latter half of the sleep period
(1). The definition of a secretory episode is

described under Materials and Methods. The amount of cortisol produced for each
episode was determined from the product
of the corrected increment of the plasma concentration and the volume of distribution. On the basis of these calculations, the following results were obtained, and are shown in Tables 1-3. The total cortisol secreted for each of the 24-hour studies is in close agreement with the previously reported values using isotope dilution techniques based on the specific activities of the urinary metabolites of cortisol. Since the termination point of a secretory episode was defined, both time spent in secretory activity and the metabolic half-life were determined. The half-life was calculated for the 36 of 53 episodes where there were at least three successive falling points. The average half-life value of 66 minutes for all studies is in close agreement with the 68 minutes determined by the isotope dilution method. Although these values are less than the value of 83 minutes originally reported by Peterson and Wyngaarden (12), the differences are not incompatible, if one takes into consideration the range of variation present in both studies and the time of day when the half-life was determined. Peterson and Wyngaarden's values ranged from 50 to 148 minutes, and our range was from 45 to 142. A mean of 93 minutes for the seven half-life determinations was obtained in our studies during the comparable three-hour morning interval in which Peterson and Wyngaarden per-

WEITZMAN ET AL.

Volume 33

The common features in these two daytime patterns are the presence of a postsecretory pause and the apparent absence of secretory activity during the last four hours of wakefulness, a feature shared with three of the five other studies.
It is important to emphasize that the data presented above, as well as previous reports by ourselves and others, seriously challenge the concept that a "steady state" or "basal level" of cortisol is present during any extended time compartment of the 24hour cycle. Indeed, only when the cortisol concentration fell to near zero was there any prolonged time of constancy; this occurred during the two to four hours in proximity to the onset of sleep. This can hardly be called a basal level, however, since there is essentially no cortisol being secreted by the adrenal gland. Moreover, these studies demonstrate great variability in both the lag time between secretory episodes and the plasma concentration at which the episodes are initiated. Therefore, any theory which proposes a closed feedback loop and/or a variable regulator ("set-point") mechanism must account for the apparent absence of a "steady state" concentration and the great variability over short time periods of cortisol and ACTH concentration throughout the entire 24-hour period (16). There is certainly strong evidence that the concentration of cortisol in blood and certain brain areas is effective in dampening the ACTH-cortisol secretory system. However, as was emphasized in our previous paper, the temporal sequence of episode initiation appears to be under central nervous system control, with a fairly consistent pattern under stable cyclic circadian conditions.
Finally, these results emphasize the importance of considering biological time in contrast to physical or clock time in defining physiologic and pathologic processes. The timed clustering of secretory episodes of the ACTH-cortisol system is only one component of the temporal rela-

tionship of a wide variety of neural, hor-
monal and metabolic processes. The new
discipline of chronobiology advocated by
Franz Halberg has fully documented the
rhythmic complexity of physiologic pat-
terns which take place in man (17, 18).
The implications of these and other experi-
mental findings in the issue of the timing of
metabolic-tissue phase synchronization, of
symptoms and pathological changes and of
treatment with ACTH and adrenal cortical
steroids, must be seriously considered.
