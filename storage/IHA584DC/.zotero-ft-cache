ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Current electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have low sensitivity.
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to test a new method to improve the diagnostic performance of the electrocardiogram.
METHODS The study was divided into 2 groups, a test and a validation cohort. In the test cohort, 94 patients were analyzed, including 47 with the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis and 47 with normal blood pressure at admission. Echocardiography was used to estimate the left ventricular mass index. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used for comparison of single and combined leads. The McNemar test was used to assess agreement among the ECG criteria against the left ventricular mass index. The proposed ECG criteria involved measuring the amplitude of the deepest S wave (SD) in any single lead and adding it to the S wave amplitude of lead V4 (SV4). Currently accepted LVH ECG criteria such as Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon were used for comparison. The validation cohort consisted of 122 consecutive patients referred for an echocardiogram regardless of the admitting diagnosis.
RESULTS The SD was the most accurate single lead measurement for the diagnosis of LVH (AUC: 0.80; p < 0.001). When both cohorts were analyzed, the SD þ SV4 criteria outperformed Cornell voltage with a signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity (62% [95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 50% to 72%] vs. 35% [95% CI: 24% to 46%]). The speciﬁcities of all the criteria were $90%, with no signiﬁcant difference among them.
CONCLUSIONS The proposed criteria for the ECG diagnosis of LVH improved the sensitivity and overall accuracy of the test. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;69:1694–703) © 2017 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

S everal electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria have previously been proposed to diagnose left ventricular hyperthrophy (LVH), with modest differences in the degree of accuracy among them (1,2). At present, 37 different ECG criteria have been endorsed by the American Heart Association, a ﬁgure that suggests lack of consensus and often leads to confusion among clinicians (3,4). The speciﬁcity of the Cornell voltage criteria, the method considered to be the most accurate, is approximately 90%, with a sensitivity of only 20% to 40% (1,5).
In the present study, we tested the performance of novel criteria, taking into consideration the dynamic changes in voltage that occur within each

electrocardiogram. We hypothesized that the summation of the amplitude of the deepest S wave in any lead (SD) with the S wave in lead V4 (SV4) would improve upon the sensitivity of the other criteria, while maintaining an adequate speciﬁcity for the diagnosis of LVH.
METHODS
POPULATION. After obtaining approval from the institutional review board, 2 different cohorts of patients were selected (the test and the validation cohorts) based on the presumptive incidence of LVH. For the test cohort, all patients admitted to our

institution from August to September 2013 with an available echocardiogram and electrocardiogram obtained during the same hospitalization were analyzed. The ﬁrst 50 consecutive patients who were admitted under the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis and 50 additional patients with normal blood pressure and no major cardiovascular disease were selected. Ultimately, 6 individuals (3 from each group) were

excluded from the analysis due to limited echocardiographic windows, leaving 94 patients for the study. Hypertensive emergency was deﬁned as systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >120 mm Hg, with evidence of end-organ damage as deﬁned by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (Joint National Committee 7) (6). Hypertensive urgency was deﬁned using the same cutoffs for blood pressure measurement but with no evidence of end-organ damage.

For the validation cohort, we selected the ﬁrst 150 patients referred to our institution for

end-diastolic and end-systolic measurements were obtained with the patient in a partial left lateral decubitus position according to recommendations by the American Society of Echocardiography (7,8). Frames with optimal visualization of interfaces and showing simultaneous visualization of the septum, left ventricular internal diameter, and posterior wall were used. A Level 3 echocardiographer performed the interpretations. Left ventricular mass was calculated by using the Devereux formula: left ventricular mass (g) ¼ 0.80 Â {1.04 Â [(septal thickness þ internal diameter þ posterior wall thickness)3 – (internal diameter)3]} þ 0.6 g. The left ventricular mass was indexed according to body surface area. LVH was deﬁned as a left ventricular mass index >115 g/m2 in male subjects and >95 g/m2 in female subjects (9).
ECG ANALYSIS. A single electrocardiogram for every patient was selected from the same day the echocardiogram was obtained. If this condition was not met, the next electrocardiogram available within the same hospitalization was used instead. All 12-lead ECG interpretations were independently reviewed by 2 cardiologists. Individual leads were analyzed by measuring the tallest R or R0 and the deepest S or QS complex in all the precordial and limb leads using the PR segment as baseline. In cases of voltage differences within the same lead, only the largest complex was selected. The proposed criteria was obtained by adding SD to the S amplitude in V4 (SD þ SV4). Cutoff values with the best balance that allowed the highest sensitivity and speciﬁcity permissible, were identiﬁed by using sex speciﬁc coordinate AUC points. A SD þ SV4 $2.3 mV for female subjects and $2.8 mV for male subjects were considered positive for LVH (Figure 1). In cases in which the SD was found in lead V4, the S wave amplitude was doubled to obtain the value SD þ SV4.
The Cornell voltage criteria was used as the main comparison given its reputation as the most accurate of the reported measurements (1). The sex-speciﬁc Cornell voltage criteria was computed as the amplitude of R in aVL plus the amplitude of S or QS complex in V3 (RaVL þ SV3) with a cutoff of >2.8 mV in men and >2.0 mV in women (5). Other LVH voltage criteria were also included in the analysis. The Sokolow-Lyon voltage was obtained by adding the amplitude of S in V1 and the amplitude of R in V5 or V6 $3.5 mV (SV1 þ RV5 or RV6); the limb lead voltage criteria amplitude of R in aVL >1.1 mV (RaVL) and amplitude of R in L1 >1.4 mV (RL1) (4,10).
STATISTICAL METHODS. The echocardiographic, ECG, and baseline clinical data were each obtained by two independent blinded reviewers. Continuous

variables that did not deviate substantially from the normal distribution were reported as mean Æ standard deviation; otherwise, they were reported as median and interquartile range (25% to 75%). Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
AUC analysis was the statistical method used to estimate the predicted performance of all individual leads and the proposed criteria. The McNemar test was used to assess for lack of agreement comparing the ECG criteria against the gold standard (left ventricular mass index), and the results were reported as percentage with their respective 95% conﬁdence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
TEST COHORT. The patients with hypertension in the test cohort (n ¼ 47) comprised 33 cases of patients who had hypertensive urgency and 14 cases with hypertensive emergency. The incidence of LVH was similar between these 2 subgroups (61% vs. 57%, respectively; p ¼ 0.90). There were no major ECG differences identiﬁed which were analyzed together as the “hypertensive group.”
In the test cohort, 30 (32%) patients were diagnosed with LVH according to echocardiogram with mean ejection fraction of 59 Æ 8%. The left ventricular mass and the left ventricular mass index were 196 Æ 79 g and 102 Æ 40 g/m2, respectively (Table 1). When comparing the 2 groups, the hypertensive individuals were older, had a higher incidence of comorbidities, and were more likely to be prescribed antihypertensive medications (Table 2). Echocardiographic analysis showed a signiﬁcant difference in ejection fraction, indexed LVH, and mitral inﬂow Ewave and A-wave ratio (Table 3). ECG analysis of the test cohort showed that the S waves in leads V3 and V4 were good predictors for the diagnosis of LVH. The SD was the most accurate, continuous single linear measurement for the diagnosis of LVH (AUC: 0.80; p < 0.001) (Table 4). However, the diagnostic accuracy of the combined SD plus SV4 was better than any single lead when analyzed as continuous variables (AUC: 0.85 vs. 0.80 vs. 0.78) (Table 4, Figure 2).
The proposed SD þ SV4 criteria (Peguero–Lo Presti) had nominally the best sensitivity (70%; 95% CI: 51% to 85%) followed by the Cornell voltage criteria with a sensitivity of 40% (95% CI: 23% to 59%). The speciﬁcity of these tests was 89% (95% CI: 79% to 95%) and 91% (95% CI: 89% to 96%), respectively. The only

VALIDATION COHORT. When comparing the test cohort versus the validation cohort, the latter group was an older population (age 68 Æ 15 years vs. 54 Æ 17 years) with a higher incidence of hypertension (69% vs. 44%) and diabetes mellitus (30% vs. 16%) (Table 6). Echocardiographic analysis revealed similar characteristics between them, with a 42% incidence of LVH (Table 1).

However, when SD þ SV4 was applied to both test and validation cohorts, the overall performance was better (AUC: 0.82 vs. 0.80), which reinforces the advantages of combining both measurements.
The proposed SD þ SV4 criteria had nominally the best sensitivity (57%; 95% CI: 42% to 71%), followed by Cornell voltage (31%; 95% CI: 19% to 46%). The speciﬁcity of both tests was 90% (95% CI: 81% to 96%) and 93% (95% CI: 84% to 98%), respectively. In addition, compared with Sokolow-Lyon voltage, RaVL and RL1, the proposed criteria demonstrated a signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity with no signiﬁcant differences in speciﬁcity (Table 8).
Combining both cohorts of patients, our measurement outperformed Cornell voltage with a signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity (62% [95% CI: 50% to 72%] vs. 35% [95% CI: 24% to 46%]). The speciﬁcities of all the criteria were $90%, and there was no signiﬁcant difference among them (Table 9). The comparison between the Cornel voltage and the Peguero–Lo Presti criteria showed lack of agreement with a p value <0.001.
According to Shourt and Fleiss analysis (with ﬁxed effect), the intra-observer variability was 0.94 and the inter-observer variability was 0.80 (11).

LVH is mainly determined by an increase in left ventricular mass, which can be estimated by the electrical voltage changes detected on the surface electrocardiogram. This principle makes the electrocardiogram an acceptable surrogate to detect changes in left ventricular mass. However, the cardiac electrical voltage does not exclusively depend on the amount of myocardium. Rather, it is dependent on active and passive electrical properties of the heart and torsum. These in turn are modiﬁed by inﬂuencing factors such as distance of left ventricular cavity–electrode, the location of the surface electrode, individual antrophometric differences, conduction abnormalities, ﬁbrosis of the myocardium, and lung pathology (3,12). In addition, it has been described that the ECG voltage may vary signiﬁcantly from day to day, between patients, or even within the same patient (4,13). All of these factors may attenuate the reproducibility of the test, leading to diagnostic errors.
Given the aformentioned pitfalls, measurement of the maximum voltage increase in any single lead would be more sensitive in identifying an increase in

the ventricular mass, rather than using any ﬁxed lead criteria. The SD was the best single lead predictor of LVH in the studied cohorts (Tables 4 and 7, Figures 2 and 3). In fact, the sum of SD þ SV4 in the studied population had a better diagnostic performance than the SD individual lead (AUC: 0.82 vs. 0.80). The SD þ SV4 criteria showed nominally an improved performance over the traditional LVH

criteria when analyzed in the test and the validation cohort separately. However, when both cohorts were combined, there was a signiﬁcant difference, noted mainly in the sensitivities, favoring the Peguero–Lo Presti criteria (Tables 5, 8, and 9).
Many of the traditional criteria had emphasized measuring the tallest amplitude of the R-wave in various leads. In contrast, the present study showed that the S waves of the precordial and limb leads had a better association with an increased left ventricular mass. Furthermore, this study showed that the Rwave or R0 complexes of many of the previously used criteria were, at best, fair predictors of LVH (Tables 4 and 7). One possible explanation for the improved performance shown in these 2 populations is that the vector generated by the depolarization of the

ventricular free wall and myocardium may be better represented by the latter part of the QRS complex, the S wave.
The double layer of depolarization across the conduction system has multiple wave fronts moving in different directions. Simultaneous electrical wave fronts are summed, and a vector of depolarization with a speciﬁc direction and magnitude is deﬁned. In the human heart, 4 vectors of depolarization have been described (Figure 2). The ﬁrst 2 vectors represent depolarization of the septum, conduction system (His bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje ﬁbers), and endomyocardial ﬁbers of the left ventricle (14). This is usually reﬂected in the ﬁrst 30 ms of the ventricular depolarization. Late third and fourth vectors, which are believed to represent the depolarization of the myocardial and epicardial free wall of the left ventricle, occur no earlier than 50 ms (Figure 4) (15). Thus, it is plausible that changes in voltage that occur in patients with mild to moderate LVH are better represented by the latter part of the QRS complex, which corresponds to the S wave (Figure 5). Therefore, identifying these early changes may increase the sensitivity of the surface electrocardiogram (Central Illustration).
It has been suggested that the surface electrocardiogram mainly provides information about the electrical ﬁeld generated by the heart and therefore

ECG Criteria for LVH

In normal left ventricle (A), the mean vector of myocardial ﬁber depolarization (black arrow), is predominantly horizontal. The precordial lead V3 will record an isoelectric QRS complex. In left ventricular hypertrophy (B), the chamber grows leftward, inferiorly, and posteriorly changing the direction and magnitude of vector 3 (black arrow). The precordial leads V3 and V4, will record a predominantly negative axis with increased amplitude of the S wave.

is not the best marker for left ventricular mass estimation. This discrepancy is best evidenced in amyloid cardiomyopathy, in which there is a severe increase in the left ventricular wall and left ventricular mass index according to echocardiogram, but up to 40% to 60% of the cases have low voltage on the surface electrocardiogram (16). In fact, LVH is not only the organ manifestation of hypertrophic growth of the cardiomyocytes but also of changes in the interstitium (17). Fibrosis and deposits of other material in the interstitium may dampen the voltage expression of the hypertrophic myocardium and limit the diagnostic capability of the surface electrocardiogram. This inherent limitation of the electrocardiogram is an important contributor to the high false-negative rate that all ECG criteria share. Nonetheless, the electrocardiogram continues to be an important low-cost tool for early screening and detection of LVH.
It is worth mentioning that the sensitivity of the proposed Peguero–Lo Presti criteria in the validation cohort decreased compared with the test cohort (70% vs. 57%). This ﬁnding may be related to the fact that the validation cohort was an older population with more comorbidities. Furthermore,

this cohort had a higher incidence of eccentric hypertrophy, which is known to decrease the overall accuracy of the electrocardiogram (18). This observation has been demonstrated in other studies in which the sensitivity of the sex-speciﬁc Cornell voltage criteria, was lesser than was previously described (2,19).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. The limitations of this study include its single-center, retrospective design and relatively small sample size. In addition, there are known limitations to the AUC statistical method (20,21). Nonetheless, the methodology and overall populations were similar to those used in previous landmark ECG-LVH studies (22,23).
Another limitation is that the left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index were estimated by using two-dimensional echocardiography, despite reports demonstrating superior accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (3,12). In addition, the main determinant of LVH in this study was the left ventricular mass. This simplistic approach ignores the hypertrophic rebuilding of myocardial tissue that occurs in early stages and may contribute to the discrepancies seen among

electrocardiogram and echocardiogram measurements (17,24). Nonetheless, echocardiography is known to have good reproducibility for the diagnosis of LVH and remains the most frequently used method in clinical practice (25).
The proposed criteria did not improve upon the limitations of previous criteria in diagnosing LVH in patients with right or left bundle branch block, ventricular paced rhythm, concomitant right ventricular hypertrophy, and other cardiomyopathies, as these subgroups were excluded from the study. Racial differences in the diagnosis of LVH were not addressed in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
This SD þ SV4 criteria provide a more sensitive measurement in the ECG diagnosis of LVH compared with the currently existing criteria and should be considered when applicable. However, further validation on a larger population is warranted before it becomes widely acceptable.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: When compared with Cornell voltage and other ECG criteria, the diagnosis of LVH can be enhanced by incorporating better representation of depolarization vectors in this disease.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Although a surrogate for more speciﬁc measurement of left ventricular mass, the electrocardiogram remains a widely available, relatively inexpensive diagnostic modality, and development of criteria that improve its diagnostic precision has implications for more efﬁcient resource utilization.
