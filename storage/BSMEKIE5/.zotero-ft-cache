Hearing one's own speech is important for language learning and maintenance of accurate articulation. For example, people with postlinguistically acquired deafness often show a gradual deterioration of many aspects of speech production. In this manuscript, data are presented that address the role played by acoustic feedback in the control of voice fundamental frequency ( F 0). Eighteen subjects produced vowels under a control (normal F 0 feedback) and two experimental conditions: F 0 shifted up and F 0 shifted down. In each experimental condition subjects produced vowels during a training period in which their F 0 was slowly shifted without their awareness. Following this exposure to transformed F 0, their acoustic feedback was returned to normal. Two effects were observed. Subjects compensated for the change in F 0 and showed negative aftereffects. When F 0 feedback was returned to normal, the subjects modified their produced F 0 in the opposite direction to the shift. The results suggest that fundamental frequency is controlled using auditory feedback and with reference to an internal pitch representation. This is consistent with current work on internal models of speech motor control. © 2000 Acoustical Society of America.
