OBJECTIVE. The objectives of this article are to review the radiologic, pathologic, and clinical features of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, tumorlet, and carcinoids and to discuss the possible role of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and tumorlet in the development of carcinoids.
CONCLUSION. Given the potential significant morbidity of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and its neoplastic counterparts, it is important to understand and recognize these disease entities. A conceptual continuum of these neuroendocrine entities is suggested.

N

ormal adult lung tissue contains few neuroendocrine cells within the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium. Despite their scarcity,

neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia can be ob-

served as a reaction to chronic airway inflam-

mation [1, 2]. In patients with carcinoid tu-

mors, neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia has

been considered a preneoplastic lesion [3].

Diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia may

occur without an identified cause and is desig-

nated diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroen-

docrine cell hyperplasia when neuroendo-

crine cell growth is confined to the bronchial

or bronchiolar epithelial basement membrane.

Extension beyond the basement membrane is

termed “tumorlet” if the collection of cells is

smaller than 5 mm and “carcinoid” when 5

mm or larger [4].

Current literature regarding these three en-

tities focuses little on their radiologic appear-

ances. We will discuss the radiologic features

of these entities in relation to their pathologic

characteristics and clinical presentations (Ta-

ble 1). Additionally, we suggest a conceptu-

al construct of viewing these three entities as

stages along a continuum of neuroendocrine

cell proliferation.

Diffuse Idiopathic Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia
Patients with diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia are typically in their fifth or sixth decade; most are asymptomatic, but some may present with insidious cough or slowly progres-

sive dyspnea. Women are more commonly affected than men. Pulmonary function testing often shows an obstructive pattern caused by protrusion of proliferating cells into multiple small airway lumens (Figs. 1A and 1B). Progressive fibrosis, possibly due to neuropeptide release from proliferating neuroendocrine cells, may further narrow airways and may eventually cause luminal obliteration [3, 5] (Fig. 2B).
Radiologic findings reflect these pathophysiologic changes. On high-resolution CT, diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia is typically characterized by mosaic perfusion due to air trapping, bronchial wall thickening, and bronchiectasis (Figs. 1B, 1C, 2C, and 2D), although a normal appearance has been reported [4]. Mucus plugging is also seen (Figs. 2C and 2D) because of airway obstruction. Nodular bronchial wall thickening is the most direct radiologic–pathologic correlation of submucosal neuroendocrine cell proliferation and correlates well with the histologic findings of intraluminal protrusion of the proliferative cells.
Tumorlet Clinically, there is a female preponder-
ance [6] and pulmonary tumorlets are generally encountered in patients between 60 and 70 years old [6–8]. Like individuals with diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, individuals with tumorlets are typically asymptomatic.
Unlike diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, the prolifer-

ation of neuroendocrine cells in tumorlets extends beyond the basement membrane. Additionally, as opposed to scattered proliferation of cells in diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, hyperplastic cells organize to form nests of less than 5 mm in tumorlets (Fig. 3A), thus differentiating tumorlets from carcinoids. Previously interpreted as early carcinoid, tumorlets are now accepted as benign [9], although extremely rare cases of tumorlets with atypia and regional lymph node metastases have been reported [6, 7].
These nests of hyperplastic cells manifest as nodules on CT. Tumorlets are also associated with areas of scarring, bronchiectasis, and emphysema (Fig. 3B) and are often associated with carcinoid and diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia [8] (Fig. 2). Therefore, tumorlets should be included in the differential diagnosis when small nodules are identified alongside carcinoids.
Carcinoids Unlike diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neu-
roendocrine cell hyperplasia and tumorlets,

carcinoids affect more men than women [10] and typically present at a younger age than bronchogenic carcinoma (mean age, 46 years). Because most carcinoids are centrally located, patients often present with obstructive symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and recurrent infection.
Atypical carcinoids are distinguished from typical carcinoids histologically by having 2–10 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields and/or areas of necrosis [11]. Radiologically, typical and atypical carcinoids are indistinguishable and will collectively be referred to as “carcinoids” herein unless otherwise noted. Usually spheric or ovoid with well-defined and slightly lobulated borders (Fig. 2F), carcinoids are often located near bronchial bifurcations (Fig. 4). Approximately 30% of bronchial carcinoids exhibit calcification histologically that may manifest on CT (Figs. 5A and 5B). Thus, when one observes a central tumor that narrows, deforms, or obstructs a bronchus and that displays diffuse or punctate calcification, a diagnosis of bronchial carci­noid should be considered [12, 13]. Because carcinoids have a rich vascular stroma, some may

show marked and homogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6). A small number of carcinoids manifest as a focal mass or nodule located entirely within a bronchial lumen (Fig. 6). Carci­noids may be associated with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Atypical carcinoids have a higher tendency to metastasize [14] and are more likely to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone than typical carcinoids. Carcinoid tumors producing adrenocorticotropic hormone have high numbers of somatostatin receptors, thus enabling detection with oc­ treotide scanning (Fig. 7). Alternatively, carcinoids may show no or very little FDG avidity on PET (Fig. 5C).
Although diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, tumorlet, and carcinoids have distinguishing histologic features, they clearly show a common link of neuroendocrine cell proliferation (Fig. 8). One can conceptualize the three entities along a continuum with diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia as the initial event. Once hyperplasia organizes and progresses beyond the basement membrane, these neuroendocrine cells aggregate to form tumorlets.

Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Cell Proliferation

When tumorlets grow larger, possibly because of an inciting critical genetic alteration, carcinoid tumors are generated. At least one report has alluded to this concept previously [4], and this concept is supported by the many shared common histologic and clinical features as well as the frequent coexistence of all three entities on radiographic examinations and pathologic specimens (Figs. 1, 2, and 4). Although this theoretic model is useful, it is important to note that carcinoids can be seen without any precursor lesions in the same biopsy specimen. Thus, additional study is essential in further defining the relationship among these entities.
Conclusion We have illustrated the radiologic, patho-
logic, and clinical features of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, tumorlet, and carcinoids. In addition, we have discussed the potential role of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and tumorlet in the development of carcinoids and have proposed a conceptual construct of viewing these three entities as stages along a continuum of neuroendocrine cell proliferation. Given their potential significant morbidity, additional

study is essential in further defining the relationship among these entities.
