Journal Description 
Language is the journal of record for the Linguistic Society of America, appearing continuously since 1925 (4 issues per year). It publishes scholarly articles that report on original research covering the field of linguistics broadly, thus treating topics that include, among others, linguistic theory (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics); language description; language in its social setting; the history of individual languages; language acquisition; experimentation on language perception, production, and processing; computational modeling of language; and the history of linguistics. Language also publishes a wide range of reviews of books of linguistic interest. 
 
Language 's authors over the years include many with cross-disciplinary recognition, e.g. Leonard Bloomfield, Noam Chomsky, Joseph Greenberg, Alfred L. Kroeber, Steven Pinker, Edward Sapir, Deborah Tannen, and Benjamin Lee Whorf. Papers published in Language are among those most frequently referred to in the field, and include, inter alia, Chomsky's oft-cited Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior ( Language 35 (1959), 26-58).
