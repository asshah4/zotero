ECG Localization of Accessory AV Pathways. Introduction: Delta wave morphology correlates with the site of ventricular insertion of accessory AV pathways. Because lesions due to radiofrequency (RF) current are small and well defined, it may allow precise localization of accessory pathways. The purpose of this study was to use RF catheter ahlation to develop an ECG algorithm to predict accessory pathway location.
Methods and Results: An algorithm was developed by correlating a resting H-lead KCG with the successful RF ahlation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single, anterogradely conducting accessory pathway (Retrospective phase). This algorithm was subsequently tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients (Prospective phase). The EC(i findings included the initial 20 msec of the delta wave in leads I, II, aVF, and V, [classified as positive (+1, negative (-), or isoelectric (±)] and the ratio of R and S wave amplitudes in leads III and V, (classified as R > S or R < S). When tested prospectively, the ECG algorithm accurately localized the accessory pathway to 1 of 10 sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli or at suhepicardiat locations within the venous system of the heart. Overall sensitivity was 90% and specificity was 99%. The algorithm was particularly useful in correctly localizing anteroseptal (sensitivity 75%, specificity 99%), and mid-septal (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98%) accessory pathways as well as pathways requiring ahlation from within ventricular venous branches or anomalies of the coronary sinus (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%).
Concltision: A simple ECG algorithm identifies accessory pathway ahlation site in WolffParkinson-White syndrome. A truly negative delta wave in lead 11 predicts ablation within the coronary venous system. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 9, pp. 2-12, January 1998)

Methods
A
Study Population
The study population consisted of 256 consecutive patients referred for RF catheter ablation of a manifest accessory atiioventricukir pathway. Subjects with more than one anterogradely conducting accessory pathway were excluded from the retrospective phase of this study. There were 157 men and 99 women (mean age 32 ± 15 years, range 9 to 78).

Study Design
An algorithm to predict accessory pathway location was developed by conelating the preablation ECG with the successful RF ablation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single anterogradely conducting accessory pathway. The algorithm was then tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients undergoing RF catheter ablation to assess its accuracy in predicting the successful ablation site. A prediction of the accessoiy pathway location based on tbe algorithm was made by one of the investigators (M.S.A.) prior to the electrophysiologic study. The location of the ablation catheter was recorded radiographically in the left anterior oblique projection, at an angle in which the catheter recording the Hisbundle potential points directly at the observer, and in the right anterior oblique projection, at an angle in which the catheter recording the His-bundle potential lays parallel to the interatrial septum.

Ahlation Site Nomenclature
Accessory pathway locations were divided into three main regions, which were further subdivided and are illustrated in Figure IA.
(I) Septal accessory pathways were subdivided into five regions: • Anteroseptal tricuspid annulus and right anteiior paraseptal (AS/RAPS), which includes accessory pathways located up lo 10 mm anterior to the His bundle in which both the accessory pathway and a His potential can be recorded from the same bipolar electrode. • Mid-.septal tricu.spid annulus (MSTA), which includes accessory pathways located at the septal section of the tricuspid annulus between the posteroseptal and antert^septal regions. • Posteroseptal tiicuspid annulus (PSTA), including accessory pathways located near the coronary sinus ostium (CSOs).

• Posteroseptal mitral annulus (PSMA). • Subepicardial posteroseptal accessory path-
ways, which consist of accessory pathways tliat nx|uired ablation fixjm within the subepicardial venous system (occasionally at the left posterior region), including the middle cardiac vein and other coronary veins; or in anomalies of the coronary sinus, such as a diverticulum (Subepicardial). (II) Right free-wall accessory pathways were subdivided into five regions: • Right anterior (RA). • Right anterolateral (RAL). • Right lateral (RL). • Right posterolateral (RPL). • Right posterior (RP). (Ill) Left free-wall accessory pathways were subdivided into four regions: • Left anterolateral (LAL). • Left lateral (LL). • Left posterolateral (LPL). • Left posterior (LP).
Analysis of the ECG
A standard I2~lead resting ECG was recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec, at a gain of 10 mm/mV using filter band settings of 0.16 to 100 Hz in each patient 1 day prior to the ablation procedure. The six limb leads were recorded simultaneously and the six pericardial leads were recorded simultaneously. The onset of the delta wave in each lead was measured from the onset of the earliest delta wave in any of the six ECG limb leads as well as in any of the six precordial leads. In the limb leads., the onset of the delta wave was often identified in lead I when it was positive. Otherwise, the earliest delta wave was inscribed in lead aVF.
The polarity of the delta wave was measured within the initial 20 msec of the preexcitation and was classified as positive (+), negative (-), or isoelectric (±), as illustrated in Figure 2A.
Results
ECG Algorithm Development
The distribution of location of the accessory patbway in the initial 135 patients is illustrated in Figure IB. ECGs for accessoiy pathways in each region were examined for distinguishing characteristics. No delta wave characteristics could be identified that reliably differentiated between some contigu-

ous sites, including: RP and RPL; RA and RAJL; LP and LPL; and LL and LAL. For this reason, pairs of regions were grouped together in the analysis. An algorithni was devised tbat correctly identified the acces.sory pathway location in 117 (87%) of the 135 patients. This algorithm is shown schematically in Figures 3 and 4, and is described below.
Step J: If either the delta wave in lead I is negative or isoelectric or the R wave is greater in amplitude than the S wave in lead V,, a left freewall accessory pathway is present. If this criterion is fulfilled, lead aVF is examined. If the delta wave in lead aVF is positive, a left lateral/anterolateral (LL/LAL) accessory pathway is identified. If a delta wave in lead aVF is isoelectric or negative, the accessory pathway is located at the left posterior/posteroiateral (LP/LPL) region (Figs. 3 and 5).
If the criteria in leads I and V, are not fulfilled, a septal or right free-wall accessory AV pathway is identified. Proceed to step 2.
Step 2: Lead II is examined. A negative delta wave in lead II identifies the subepicardial posteroseptal accessory pathway (Figs. 3 and 6). If the delta wave in lead II is isoelectric or positive, proceed to step 3.
Step 3: Lead V, is examined. A negative or isoelectric delta wave in lead V, identifies a septal accessory pathway. If this criterion isfijlfilled,lead aVF is examined. If the delta wave in lead aVF

A positive delta wave in aVE identifies a pathway located within the anteroseptal/right anterior para.septal (AS/RAPS) or mid-septal tricuspid annuUis (MS) regions. These two regions are differentiated by examining tbe R/S ratio in lead III: R > S identifies anteroseptal/right anterior paraseptal (AS/RAPS) accessory pathway, and R < S identifies an accessory pathway located along tbe mid-septal tricuspid annulus (MSTA), as illustrated in Eigures 3 and 8.

ECG Algorithm Validation
The ECG algorithm was then tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients. The distribution

of accessory pathway location based upon site of successful ablation is shown in Eigure IC. The relationship between the predicted location (based upon the ECG algorithm) and the actual location (based upon ablation site) is shown in Table I. The algorithm correctly identitied accessory pathway locations in 109 patients (sensitivity 90%, specificity 99%. positive predictive value 93%. and negative predictive value 98%), calculated as weighted averages (weighted by number of true positives).
Discussion
Several attempts have been made to correlate electrocardiographic findings with anatomic locations of accessory AV pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.'^- ECG criteria based upon surgical dissection of accessory pathways have shown accuracy in identifying accessory pathway location.- '- The ECG algorithm developed in this study differs from prior algorithms in its combined use of the resting (not during atrial pacing) ECG. utilization of only five ECG leads, localization by catheter ablation techniques (which may allow precise localization of the accessory pathway), and by prospective validation of the algorithm. This algorithm is particularly accurate in predicting ablation at sites near the AV node and His bundle with risk of AV block.

such as mid-septal and anteroseptal regions, and for predicting ablation of subepicardia! accessory pathways from the venous system., such as coronary veins and anomalies of the coronary sinus. This latter region has been associated witb failed ablation and cardiac perforation.-' To facilitate the interpretation of delta wave polarity, this algorithm only uses the initial forces of preexcitation (initial 20 msec) after the earlie.st delta wave onset in any of the limb leads as well as the precordial leads to cbaracterize delta wave polaiity. This may avoid misinterpretation when changes in polarity occur within 40 msec, which is not an uncommon llnding (illustrated in Fig. 2B and shown in lead 11 of Fig. 7, left panel). Also, analysis of only the initial 20 msec of delta wave may help to identify some left free-wall accessory pathways producing minimal preexcitation in sinus rhythm or pathways exhibiting slow anterograde conduction.

ECG Criteria Based upon RF Catheter Ablation of
Accessory AV Pathways
RF catheter ablation has been used widely for treating patients with an accessory pathway.^^"^^ Certain ECG findings may coirelate with tbe location of accessory pathways in these patients. We bave reported previously a preliminary ECG algorithm for identifying posteroseptal accessory pathways'' and subsequently for identifying accessoiy pathways located at 10 different sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli using only ECG leads I, II, aVF. and V,.'^ Others have used tbe maximally preexcited 12-lead ECG during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing, delta wave polarity in the initial 40 msec of the preexcited QRS complexes, and frontal and horizontal delta wave axis were used for analysis.'*' Combination of multiple variables, such as (1) precordial transition, (2) R and S waves amplitude ratio. (3) sum of tbe polarities of delta wave. (4) amplitude of delta wave, (5) delta wave axis in the frontal plane, and (6) amplitude of R wave, have been used witb success,'"' but the analysis of this complex set of variables is yet to be validated prospectively. In two otber studies, the ECG algorithm was tested prospectively. One used the polarity and morphology of QRS complexes and the highest R wave amplitude in the precordial leads."* Tbey showed an 86% accuracy in locating accessory pathways at nine sites around the tricuspid and mitral annulus. Tbe specific sensitivities and specificities were not reported and. due to the small number of patients and the fact that a broad region on the right

free wall had to be combined to a single site may compromise the resolution of their algorithm. The other study in which the ECG algorithm was validated prospectively'^ used a similar design and resolution to our preliminary reported results.'^ Nevertheless, our algorithm exhibited a positive predictive accuracy of 93% in locating accessory patliways at 10 different sites. In addition, we could distinguish anteroseptal from right anterior accessory pathways, whereas their algorithm could not discriminate accessory pathways located in a highrisk region for AV block {anteroseptal) from accessory pathways located in a relatively low-risk region (right anterior).
Utility of the Algorithm for Identifying Accessory Pathways Requiring Ablation from the Subepicardial Venous System
Surgery for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has shown that accessory pathways may be associated with coronary sinus venous anomalies such as aneurysms and diverticula.-**-^ We have reported previously that some accessory pathways require ablation from within the coronary venous system in the subepicardial posteroseptal-'^-^^ and left free-

regions. Other investigators have also used RF energy to ablated accessory pathways from the coronaiy sinus, middle cardiac vein, and coronary sinus diverticulum.'**""^
Accessory pathways associated with coronary veins and anomalies of the coronary sinus may account for catheter ablation failure at the tricuspid and mitral annulus. In our institution, approximately 40% of patients refen'ed following at least one unsuccessful ahlation attempt for a posteroseptal accessory pathway required ablation from coronary veins or anomalies of the coronary sinus.^'' In this study, a negative delta wave in ECG lead II was useful in predicting ablation from coronary veins and anomalies of coronar-y sinus in all 14 patients. It is important to rule out a brief initial isoelectric segment of the delta wave in lead II before labeling it as negative. This initially isoelectric delta wave may be followed by a negative component that is often associated with an accessory pathway located at the posteroseptal tricuspid annulus, and right posterior and right posterolateral regions (Fig. 2A and Fig. 7, left panel). An ECG exhibiting a true negative delta wave in lead II will also show a negative delta wave in leads III and aVF (Fig. 6). In our experience, this finding is associated with

a posterosepta] accessory pathway having a subepicardial ventricular itisertion, requiring successful ablation from the coronary venou.s system. Despite the tact that a negative delta wave in the interior leads is generally accepted to be associated with a posteroseptal accessory pathway, the ECG from patients requiring successful ablation froin the endocardium may show a negative delta wave in leads III and aVE but unlikely a negative delta wave in lead II.
Utility of the Algorithm for Identifying Anteroseptal and Mid-Septal Accessory Pathways
Surgical dissection as well as catheter ablation of accessory pathways located near tbe AV node and His-bundle region have been associated with procedure failure and AV block.*^ "•-'^•^' This accounts for a signiticant proportion of the morbidity of RF ablation procedures.-'' Mid-.septal accessory pathways were first described as intermediate septal accessory pathways exhibiting positive delta wave morphology in ECG leads I, II, and aVL, and isoelectric in leads III and aVF.'^" In this study, the initial forces of the delta wave in lead aVE were positive (Eig. 8, right panel). Others bave separated the mid-septal region into three zones

and, in agreement to our findings, a positive delta wave in lead aVE correlated witb a mid-septal accessory pathway in close proximity to tbe AV conduction system.-' Li tbis study, 3 of 4 anteroseptal and all 5 of 5 mid-septal accessory pathways were correctly localized by tbe algoritbm.
Clinical Implications
As the ECG algorithm accurately localizes accessory pathways prior to ablation, it may belp the physician advi.se the patient regarding the likelihood of success and complications of the procedure, in particular subjects with anteroseptal or mid-septal accessory pathways. The ECG algorithm may aid .selection of patients in whom coronary sinus angiography should be perfomied in order to delineate its anatomy, thus allowing mapping in the coronary veins and anomalous stnjctures of the coronary sinus.
Limitations
Multiple accessory pathways have been documented in 2% to 20% of subjects.^-^ In the retrospective phase of our study, we only included patients with a single anterogradely conducting ac-

cessory pathway. During the prospective pbase, there were no patients with more than one accessory pathway exhibiting anterograde conduction. Because of the limited experience in using this algorithm in subjects with multiple pathways, we cannot comment on its utility in this setting. Accessory AV pathways exhibit a slant course across the tnitral or tricu.spid annulus. and delta wave morphology is dependent upon the site of ventricular insertion of accessory pathways. Tbis ECG algorithm does not necessarily identify the site of earliest ventricular activation {ventricular insertion). It was developed based upon tbe site of successful RE catheter ablation of accessory pathways, which were detemiined primarily by recordings of accessory pathway activation potential. Therefore, the slant course of accessoiy pathways, whicb could account for error in localization, sbould not influence the accuracy of tbis ECG algorithm. Previous catheter ablation may limit the usefulness of an ECG algoritbm. The necrosis of tissue around the ventricular insertion of the accessory pathway may affect tbe sequence of ventricular preexcitation, accounting for a different delta wave pattern on the ECG. Nevertheless, it did not appear to affect tbe accuracy in our study, as 48 of 121 patients (40%) bad had a previous failed ablation.
