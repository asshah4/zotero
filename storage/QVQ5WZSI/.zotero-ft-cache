    NOCARDIOSIS is an acute or chronic infection that may closely resemble other suppurative conditions due to such varied agents as klebsiella, pasteurella, salmonella, malleomyces and actinomyces. The cattle studied by Nocard 1 were suffering from multiple abscesses, draining sinuses, emaciation and pulmonary involvement with fatal termination. The disease occurs in other animals 2 3 4 and is frequently misdiagnosed as actinomycosis, 5 although the condition reported by Nocard is quite different from actinomycosis, as described by Harz 6 and Bollinger. 7 The causative organism is also quite different from the actinomyces isolated by Wolff and Israel 8 but it probably is closely related to, if not identical with, the aerobic organism described by Bostroem. 9 The differentiation between actinomyces and nocardia has been set forth clearly by Waksman and Henrici 10 and is the basis of the classification used in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology , 11 which lists 33 species of nocardia. 
 
    The following cases are presented to illustrate the importance of recognizing early whether a pulmonary infection is due to nocardia, so that when nocardiosis is present, proper chemotherapy may be administered promptly to save a life or prevent the crippling effects of metastatic lesions in vital organs. 
    Case Reports 
 
    Case 1. A 26-year-old physician registered at the Mayo Clinic in 1944 with a clinical diagnosis of "arrested minimal pulmonary tuberculosis" based on a negative Mantoux reaction in 1940 that became positive in 1942 and on a roentgenogram in November, 1943, that showed a lesion in the right upper lobe. Repeated bacteriologic studies were negative for acid-fast bacilli. In June, 1944, x-ray examination showed that the lesion had enlarged and was probably excavating. Further studies in the sanatorium were negative for acid-fast bacilli. In the fall of 1945, fluid began to accumulate in the right pleural space. Numerous smears and cultures of the fluid were negative for acid-fast bacilli. The patient was treated with penicillin, without improvement. In March, 1946, a culture of the pleural fluid was positive for Nocardia asteroides. Growth of the organism was not inhibited by penicillin but was inhibited by a 1:80,000 dilution of sulfadiazine. Sulfadiazine was given orally and intrapleurally; the patient recovered and was back at work in 5 months. He has remained well to date. 
 
    Case 2. A 7-year-old boy was brought to the clinic on March 7, 1946, because of cough and persistent fever. On December 17, 1945, the parents had noted a sudden high fever (temperature of 105°F.). About 2 weeks later a cough productive of 120 to 240 cc. (4 to 8 ounces) of purulent sputum daily had begun. The temperature had persistently risen to 104 or 105°F. twice daily in spite of repeated courses of penicillin. On arrival the patient appeared acutely and critically ill. A roentgenogram of the thorax showed extensive bilateral pneumonitis, with a suggestion of multiple abscesses in the left lung ( Fig. 1 Figure 1 Extensive Bilateral Pneumonitis in Case 2. ). A review of roentgenograms made at home disclosed that the process had begun on the left side and had progressed before extending to the right lung. Examination of the blood revealed a red-cell count of 1,940,000, with a hemoglobin of 7.5 gm. per 100 cc, and a white-cell count of 28,600, with 97 per cent neutrophils. Penicillin was administered, but the temperature continued its rises, to 104 to 106°F., once or twice daily. The patient failed rapidly and died 5 days after admission. Autopsy disclosed organizing pneumonia and multiple pulmonary abscesses from which N. asteroides was cultured. 
 
    Case 3. A 42-year-old dentist with Cushing's syndrome underwent bilateral exploration of the adrenal glands. Half the right adrenal gland was removed, and the patient was dismissed on November 7, 1947. On January 29, 1948, he was readmitted to the clinic with cough productive of thick, yellow sputum and hemoptysis. Roentgenograms showed an area of pneumonia in the right lower lobe ( Fig. 2 Figure 2 Pneumonitis of the Right Lower Lobe in Case 3. ), and cultures of the sputum were positive for N. asteroides. When the patient was treated with 8 to 10 gm. of sulfadiazine daily, the cough and hemoptysis soon ceased, and x-ray examination demonstrated rapid regression of the intrapulmonary process. In December, 1948, he died at home, presumably of Cushing's syndrome. 
 
    Case 4. A 57-year-old woman came to the clinic on May 14, 1949, because of fever, anemia and rapid pulse. In December, 1947, she had been found to have pulmonary tuberculosis and had been treated with rest in bed. Streptomycin was given for 6 weeks, but treatment had to be discontinued because of blurred vision. In March, 1949, she had 1 episode of "flu," with cough and production of yellow sputum, lasting 2 weeks. In April she had had daily rises of temperature up to 103°F. 
 
    Examination at the clinic disclosed tenderness of the abdomen and x-ray evidence of a cavity in the left apex. Laparotomy on June 3 showed numerous tubercles in the peritoneum and omentum that were proved to be tuberculous by guinea-pig inoculation. Rapid improvement followed treatment with dihydrostreptomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid, and the patient was discharged on September 3. 
 
    On November 1 she had another attack of "flu" with severe cough, production of gray sputum, hoarseness and pain in the right side of the thorax. She returned on December 5, in critical condition, with x-ray evidence of numerous lesions throughout both pulmonary fields ( Fig. 3 Figure 3 Diffuse Bilateral Pulmonary Lesions in Case 4. ); she was thought to have bronchial dissemination of the tuberculosis. The white-cell count was 36,000, and the appearance of the sternal bone marrow suggested monocytic leukemia of the Naegeli type. She was given dihydrostreptomycin and urethane, but she died on December 21. 
 
    At autopsy, the following anatomic diagnoses were made: organizing bronchopneumonia of the lungs, with multiple abscesses of the right upper lobe due to N. asteroides ( Fig. 4 Figure 4 Bronchiectasis, Emphysema of Both Lobes and Abscesses of the Upper Lobe of the Right Lung Due to Nocardiosis (Case 4). and 5 Figure 5 Abscess of the Upper Lobe of the Right Lung (Brown—Gram Stain X 1,400) Due to Nocardiosis (Case 4). Note the branching mycelia. ); chronic bronchiectasis (aspergillus present in the left upper lobe); evidence of former abdominal exploration for tuberculous peritonitis; healing ulcerative enteritis (tuberculosis with multiple strictures); hypertrophy of the liver (weight, 2170 gm.) and spleen (weight, 385 gm.) (acute monocytic leukemia found clinically); and hemangioma of the right cerebellar hemisphere. 
 
    Case 5. A 57-year-old woman came to the clinic on June 10, 1949, because of frequent colds and blood-streaked nasal discharge that she had had for 6 months. She had had purulent otitis media, which had been treated by surgical drainage in March. In May, she had had conjunctivitis, and x-ray examination had shown "spots on the lung." She had been hospitalized, had had night sweats and had become very weak. 
 
    The temperature was 100°F. There was bilateral nerve deafness. The white-cell count was 12,400, and the sedimentation rate 129 mm. in 1 hour. Grade 2 hematuria and pyuria were found. There was roentgenologic evidence of infiltration in the right-middle-lung field and of 2 small areas of pneumonitis in the left lung. A tuberculin test with second-strength purified-protein derivative gave a Grade 2 reaction (on a basis of 1 to 4). Cultures of the sputum were negative for acid-fast bacilli but positive for Candida albicans. Cultures of the urine were positive for Escherichia coli. No positive diagnosis was made and the patient was sent home to await results of cultures of the sputum, gastric washings and urine. 
 
    On October 8 she returned, critically ill, with spastic quadriplegia and x-ray evidence of a lesion 4 cm. in diameter in the upper lobe of the right lung ( Fig. 6 Figure 6 Large Mass in the Right Lung, with Hazy Infiltration of the Left Lung, in Case 5. ). The white-cell count was 18,300, the sedimentation rate 140 mm. in 1 hour, and the blood urea 309 mg. per 100 cc. Autopsy, however, disclosed pulmonary and cerebral abscesses from which N. asteroides was cultured. 
 
    Case 6. A 53-year-old woman, who came to the Mayo Clinic on June 22, 1953, had been ill since January, with daily fever (temperature of 101°F.) and a cough productive of 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of thick, white sputum daily. The condition did not respond to treatment with either penicillin or streptomycin. 
 
    X-ray examination disclosed pneumonia in the basal segments of the right lower lobe ( Fig. 7 Figure 7 Pneumonitis in the Basal Segments of the Right Lower Lobe in Case 6. ). The white-cell count was 9000, and the sedimentation rate 78 mm. in 1 hour. Cultures of the bronchial secretions from the right lower lobe were positive for N. asteroides. Exploratory craniotomy performed because of headache, drowsiness and weakness of the left side of the body demonstrated a multilocular brain abscess. Cultures of the pus were positive for N. asteroides. 
 
    Treatment with sulfadiazine was started on July 3, the day N. asteroides was reported from the bronchial washings and 6 days before craniotomy. The patient gradually improved, and the lesion in the right lower lobe disappeared. She was discharged to the care of her home physician and home hospital on September 6. She returned on November 11, critically ill, with headache, fever, weakness of the left side of the body, convulsions and unresponsiveness, and died on December 11. 
 
    At autopsy the following anatomic diagnoses were made: previous right frontoparietal craniotomy and resection for a multilocular abscess of the right frontoparietal parasagittal region of the brain (N. asteroides) ; residual abscesses of the left parietal lobe of the brain ( Fig. 8 Figure 8 Confluent Abscesses of the Left Parietal Lobe of the Brain Due to Nocardiosis in Case 6. and 9 Figure 9 Abscesses of the Brain (Hematoxylin and Eosin Stain X 100) Due to Nocardiosis in Case 6. Note the daughter abscesses and lack of encapsulation. ); edema of the brain, with notching of the left peduncle; abscesses, with scarring, of the right lower lobe of the lung (N. asteroides? — cultures negative); thrombosis of the left iliac and femoral veins, with edema of the left leg. 
 
    Case 7. A 15-month-old boy was brought to the clinic on January 14, 1953. During the first 6 months of life he had had diarrhea and a skin rash. In September, 1952, at 1 year of age, he began to have a cough and fever (temperature of 101°F.), and had a generalized convulsion. Episodes of cough and fever continued, and a diagnosis of pneumonia was made in December, 1952. In spite of treatment with oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and cortisone, his illness gradually worsened. 
 
    X-ray examination revealed bilateral pneumonia ( Fig. 10 Figure 10 Extensive Bilateral Pneumonitis in Case 7. ). The white-cell count was 15,000. The duodenal contents demonstrated a normal amount of trypsin. Tuberculin, histoplasmin and coccidioidin skin reactions were negative. Cultures of swabs from the pharynx were positive for Aerobacter aerogenes and C. albicans. Fluctuations of temperature up to 104°F. prevented bronchoscopy as a means of obtaining suitable material for bacteriologic study. Chlortetracycline, penethamate hydriodide and erythromycin did not control the infection, and the patient died on February 4, 1953. Autopsy revealed multiple abscesses in both lungs, the brain, the pancreas and the intercostal muscles. Cultures of the abscesses showed N. asteroides. 
    Discussion 
    Clinical and Roentgenologic Considerations 
 
    In each of the cases presented above, pulmonary disease was the initial problem. This was usually manifested by cough of varying degrees of severity. 
 
    The sputum was usually thick, sticky and either mucopurulent or purulent. The temperature varied from normal to daily elevations up to 105°F., and the patients exhibited variable degrees of systemic reaction. 
 
    The portal of entry of the organism was thought to be the respiratory tract in each case, and in most cases the prominent symptoms were related to the lungs. A review of the literature shows that N. asteroides has been cultured, however, from almost every part of the body, including the brain, lymph nodes, skin and subcutaneous tissues, bone, kidney and various portions of the alimentary tract. Nocardiosis has occurred after dental extractions, 12 , 13 and the possibility of the alimentary tract as a portal of entry has been emphasized. 14 It is possible, then, for the organism to gain entry through a break in the mucosa or even from a break in the skin, and from there to be spread to other portions of the body. 
 
    The central nervous system has been the most frequent extrapulmonary site of the disease. There was definite clinical involvement of the nervous system in 2 of the cases reported above, with intracerebral abscess formation. The pleural space was involved in 1 case, with empyema. 
 
    A review of the roentgenograms in these 7 cases discloses no features that are diagnostic of nocardiosis. In each case, abnormal shadows were present, but they varied from a small one in an upper lobe, which was mistakenly thought to represent active tuberculosis (Case 1), to those of bilateral patches of consolidation, which were thought to represent suppurative pneumonia with abscess formation (Case 2). 
 
    In Cases 3 and 6 there was a local pneumonic process that subsequently cleared up when the patient was treated with sulfadiazine. In Cases 2 and 5 the disease was disseminated when the patients were first seen whereas dissemination occurred during the period of observation in Case 4. In Case 1 pleural fluid began to accumulate after pneumothorax was initiated for therapeutic purposes. 
 
    It seems that the disease begins in the lung as a local area of pneumonia, and that it may progress by dissemination or by the formation of an abscess. Such a pattern is certainly not diagnostic from the roentgenologic point of view, since it may be produced by other infectious processes. The x-ray examination is useful in revealing the presence of the disease in the lung, in determining its location and extent and in following its course, but in no way can it enable the physician to diagnose the specific etiologic agent. The differential roentgenologic diagnosis must include tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, acute bacterial pneumonia and possibly primary carcinoma (Case 5). 
 
    The only diagnostic laboratory procedure is bacteriologic demonstration of the organism. As is to be expected in any infectious process, anemia, leukocytosis and increase of the sedimentation rate are common. In 1943, Drake and Henrici 15 reported the production of an allergic state by intratesticular injection of oil suspensions of live organisms into guinea pigs and rabbits. They then demonstrated the allergic state by intracutaneous injection of a crude extract of powdered organisms, which produced swelling with an area of central necrosis similar to the tuberculin reaction. There was no cross reaction with tuberculin. We have had no experience with this test and cannot testify to its validity. 
 
    Nocardiosis should be suspected when an acute or subacute pneumonitic process does not respond promptly to treatment with the usual antibiotics such as penicillin or tetracycline compounds. Even though the roentgenologic appearance most commonly resembles that of tuberculosis, the clinical course is usually more acute than that of tuberculosis, and the sputum is more frequently thick, sticky and purulent. The disease clinically may resemble other mycotic diseases such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. When there is unilateral pulmonary infiltrate, neoplasm must frequently be considered. Nocardiosis further mimics bronchogenic carcinoma in frequency of intracerebral metastasis. 
 
    It is apparent that the diagnosis of nocardiosis depends on demonstration of the organism in the bacteriologic laboratory. It is the responsibility of the clinician, however, to be alert to the diagnostic possibilities, to obtain proper material for culture by the bacteriologist and to request that cultures for fungi be performed. 
 
    Recognition of the organism is exceedingly important because an effective chemotherapeutic agent is available. Sulfadiazine was used in 3 of the cases reported above, and in each it was effective against the disease. Penicillin was given in 4 cases, chlortetracycline in 2, and oxytetracycline in 1, without influencing the course of the disease. These results are similar to the experimental findings of Strauss, Klingman and Pillsbury, 16 who performed studies in vitro and in vivo. They used chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, amithiozone, sulfoxone, para-aminosalicylic acid, N, N-bis hydrazine and sodium sulfadiazine. In vivo studies in mice demonstrated that sodium sulfadiazine gave 100 per cent protection against death from infection with N. asteroides when administered in doses of 50 to 100 mg. per kilogram of body weight daily. None of the other drugs approached it in efficacy. 
 
    In the administration of sulfadiazine the oral route may be used, and approximately 6 to 10 gm. daily should be given. Ideally, the blood concentration of this drug should be kept between 16 and 20 mg. per cubic centimeter. The duration of treatment depends to some extent on the severity of the disease and the response to medication. One should plan on several weeks of treatment but may have to alter the dose or even discontinue use of the drug temporarily if renal complications arise. Urinalysis and determination of blood urea should be made frequently; the likelihood of impairment of renal function may be minimized by the concomitant administration of sodium bicarbonate. 
 
    One of the 3 patients who received sulfadiazine was treated for three months, and the other 2 for five months. The disease responded in each case. 
 
    One patient recovered completely and is well seven years later. A second patient recovered from nocardiosis but died subsequently, presumably from Cushing's disease. The third patient died from an intracerebral abscess due to N. asteroides, but the pulmonary lesion disappeared roentgenologically during the administration of sulfadiazine. 
 
    Surgical treatment should be given as indicated. This includes drainage or excision of abscesses wherever they may occur. It may be superfluous to mention that adequate rest and nourishment are desirable. 
    Pathological Considerations 
 
    From the standpoint of gross pathology the lung was the most frequently involved organ. It was apparently the primary site of the infection in 6 of the 7 cases. The brain and the spleen were involved in 2 cases each, and in 1 of these the spleen appeared to be the source of generalized peritonitis caused by N. asteroides. Grossly, most of the lesions took the form of abscesses, which were generally multiple and often confluent. The absence of extensive scarring, burrowing or sinus formation served to differentiate most of the lesions from those caused by Actinomyces israeli. From the gross appearance alone, the lesion was likely to be confused with suppurative processes due to common pyogenic organisms or caseous tuberculosis—that is, it was more characteristic of suppurative processes and tuberculosis than of actinomycosis. 
 
    The histologic reaction of various organs and tissues to infection with N. asteroides was remarkably uniform in the 5 cases studied at autopsy. Worthy of emphasis was the extensive necrosis of tissue with the formation of confluent abscesses and the absence of encapsulation ( Fig. 9 ). In most cases there appeared to be little or no attempt at localization of the abscesses. Occasionally, there was a partial wall of loose granulation tissue, and rarely bands of fibrous tissue incompletely encircled the lesions. Daughter abscesses in the neighboring tissue were common. The absence of localization of the lesions, particularly those in the lungs, probably accounts for the widespread hematogenous dissemination in 3 of the cases. When dissemination does occur, the brain is especially likely to be involved. 
 
    The histologic reaction is quite distinct from the reaction to A. israeli, which usually calls forth extensive fibrosis, and in the abscesses the so-called sulfur granules are often found. Such granules were not observed in any of our cases. Worthy of emphasis also is the fact that the lesions did not resemble granulomas. Although necrosis of tissue was always observed, it was not associated with the formation of epithelioid cells, it was accompanied by minimal formation of granulation tissue, and only occasionally were giant cells observed. Fibrous encapsulation was not a feature of these lesions. 
 
    Finally, it is noteworthy that accurate diagnosis cannot be made by histologic examination. The organisms are not visible with hematoxylin and eosin stains and can be found only by the use of special stains such as the Brown—Gram technic. The organisms form gram-positive (granular), branching mycelia approximately 1 micron in diameter. Even this finding is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis. For accurate diagnosis, identification of the organism by cultural methods is mandatory. 
    Bacteriologic Considerations 
 
    The cultural features of species of nocardia are well given in Bergey's Manual 11 and in modern textbooks of medical bacteriology. These micro-organisms grow as fine, branching filaments that may fragment into bacillary or coccoid forms. Some stains are acid fast and may be confused with tubercle bacilli. In Case 4 the organisms might easily have been so misinterpreted if bronchoscopy had been done. Although the filaments in histologic sections are seldom if ever visible with the usual hematoxylin and eosin stain, they are easily demonstrated by the technic described by Brown and Brenn 17 for applying the gram stain to tissues. 
 
    In the diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis, many problems may be encountered. Gastric washings, commonly used to make cultures for tubercle bacilli, may contain nocardia because of its wide distribution among food materials. An occasional colony may occur apparently as a contaminant on cultures made from specimens of sputum, but if numerous colonies are present on repeated examinations and if no other recognizable pathogen can be found, it may be justifiable to consider them as probably being causally related to the pulmonary lesions. 
 
    When the intrapulmonary lesions occur in small children and infants, it may be impossible to collect specimens of sputum. In such cases, if the intrapulmonary process has not responded to ordinary medical management within a week or two, it appears advisable to collect material from the trachea or bronchi by bronchoscopic means. In Case 7, smears of the trachea and bronchi taken at autopsy showed the organisms to be present in large numbers, so that culture of adequate material from these regions would probably have given the correct diagnosis. 
 
    In Cases 2, 4 and 5, the histologic features were such that one could hardly expect the organisms to be found in either sputum or bronchial secretions. In such cases it appears advisable to obtain a suitable specimen of lung for biopsy. In such a procedure it is suggested that several small lesions are more likely to contain the causative agent than one large lesion, since micro-organisms are seldom uniformly distributed in pathologic processes of this type. A generous sampling is also advocated because an adequate bacteriologic examination must include the inoculation of animals and the making of cultures for tubercle bacilli, various fungi and such bacteria as brucella, hemophilus, klebsiella and pasteurella. In addition, it may be necessary to examine the material for amebas and to make other tests, including chemical examination for such substances as beryllium, silicon and barium. The purpose of the biopsy is to determine as accurately as possible the cause of the condition, and the laboratory should be prepared to do whatever is necessary to establish the nature of the causative agent. For this purpose a generous specimen may be needed. 
    Summary and Conclusions 
 
    Seven cases of intrapulmonary nocardiosis are presented from the standpoint of clinical, roentgenologic, pathological and bacteriologic findings. 
 
    The lungs appeared to be the primary site of infection. In 3 cases metastatic lesions involved the brain. 
 
    In none of the cases did the disease respond to antibiotic therapy. However, in 3 cases in which it was recognized and treated with sulfonamides, the patient responded rapidly to this treatment. 
 
    There were no clinical, roentgenologic or laboratory data that would serve to distinguish intrapulmonary lesions due to Nocardia asteroides from those due to subacute or chronic infection with other common microbial agents. 
 
    Intensive efforts should be made to determine the etiologic basis of any intrapulmonary infection that fails to resolve on antibiotic therapy. The diagnosis of nocardiosis can be made only by isolation and identification of the organism from suitable clinical material. Such material may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy or even by biopsy of pulmonary tissue. 
 
    The pathologic process was dominated by necrosis with suppuration and the accumulation of a few macrophages. Fibrosis was minimal or nonexistent.
