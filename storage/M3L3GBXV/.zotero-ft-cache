BACKGROUND The electrocardiographic (ECG) marker P terminal force V1 (PTFV1) is generally perceived as a marker of left atrial pathology and has been associated with atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter (AF).
OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the association between PTFV1 components (duration and amplitude) and incident AF and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA).
METHODS The study included patients with an ECG recorded at the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory in 2001 to 2011. PTFV1 4 mV$ms was considered abnormal. Patients with abnormal PTFV1 were stratiﬁed into tertiles based on duration (PTDV1) and amplitude (PTAV1) values. Cox regressions adjusted for age, sex, and relevant comorbidities were used to investigate associations between abnormal PTFV1 components and AF and stroke/TIA.

RESULTS Of 267,636 patients, 5803 had AF and 18,176 had stroke/ TIA (follow-up 6.5 years). Abnormal PTFV1 was present in 44,549 subjects (16.7%) and was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Among patients with abnormal PTFV1, the highest tertile of PTDV1 (78–97 ms) was associated with the highest risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.37; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.23–1.52) and highest risk of stroke/TIA (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05 –1.20). For PTAV1, the highest tertile (78–126 mV) conferred the highest risk of AF and stroke/TIA (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09–1.32; and HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.14–1.25, respectively).
CONCLUSION Abnormal PTFV1 was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Increasing PTDV1 showed a dose– response relationship with the development of AF and stroke/ TIA, whereas the association between PTAV1 and AF was less apparent.

Introduction
Atrial ﬁbrillation is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality,1 with stroke being the most feared complication. Interand intra-atrial conduction abnormalities can be identiﬁed on the electrocardiogram (ECG), manifesting as a biphasic P wave, most often in lead V1. The terminal negative deﬂection of a biphasic P wave in lead V1 is referred to as the P terminal force V1 (PTFV1). PTFV1 is calculated as the product of its duration component (PTDV1) and its absolute amplitude component (PTAV1). An absolute PTFV1 value 4 mV$ms is considered abnormal.2,3 PTFV1 is generally perceived as a marker of left atrial pathology, and abnormal PTFV1 has been associated with incident atrial ﬁbrillation4–6 and stroke.7–10 However, the PTFV1 components (ie, duration and amplitude) and their individual associations with AF are not fully elucidated.
Increasing interest in early detection of patients at risk for developing atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter (AF) is a priority issue, in terms of both patient safety and economic beneﬁt. We investigated the prognostic value of an abnormal PTFV1 measurement for incident AF and stroke, including the individual associations between PTDV1 and PTAV1, and incident AF and stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
Methods Study population and setting
The study population consisted of patients with an ECG recorded in a primary care setting at the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory (CGPL) in 2001 to 2011.11 Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of AF before baseline ECG, by either International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes or ECG as well as treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs commonly used to treat AF (for details, see Supplemental Material). Patients with ECG ﬁndings that made evaluation of P terminal force (PTF) unreliable (eg, second- and third degree atrioventricular block and atrial tachycardia (for details, see Supplemental Material) also were excluded. Cardiovascular diagnoses were previously validated in the Danish National Patient Registry with high predictive values for cardiovascular diagnoses, including AF.12
Baseline comorbidity and concomitant medical therapy From the Danish National Patient Registry,13 the following comorbidities present before the ﬁrst ECG were identiﬁed from ICD-10 diagnosis codes: heart failure, cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, other arrhythmias, other cardiac diseases, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism (including thyrotoxicosis), and hypothyroidism (for details, see Supplemental Material).

Patients with hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disease often awe diagnosed and treated exclusively in the primary care setting. Because diagnoses from primary care settings are unavailable, relevant medication was used as a proxy for these comorbidities. For example, antidiabetic medicines prescribed within 180 days before the ﬁrst ECG were used to deﬁne diabetes (for details, see Supplemental Materials).
Hypertension was deﬁned as a combination therapy of at least 2 antihypertensive drugs with a maximum of 100 days between consecutive prescriptions both within a 5-year period before inclusion.
All ICD and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes used in the deﬁnition of comorbidities and concomitant medical therapy are provided in the Supplemental Material. Information on all dispensed prescription drugs sold in Denmark since 1995 was provided in the Registry of Medicinal Products Statistics.14,15
PTF and its components Digital 12-lead ECGs of 10-second duration were stored in the MUSEÒ Cardiology Information System (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI).11 All ECGs were recorded at a resolution of 4.88 mV/least signiﬁcant bit @ 500 samples per second and ﬁltered using 0.05-Hz (high-pass) and 150-Hz (low-pass) settings. The 12SL algorithm Version 241 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) was used to automatically measure ECG parameters.
PTFV1 (in the presence of a biphasic P wave with positive/negative conﬁguration) was deﬁned as the duration (in milliseconds) times the absolute value of the peak terminal negative component (in millivolts) of the P wave in lead V1. In agreement with previous studies, we categorized absolute PTFV1 values into the following categories: abnormal PTFV1 4 mV$ms (PTFV1-abnormal); normal 0  PTFV1  4 mV$ms (PTFV1-normal); or nonexistent if the product of duration and amplitude was zero (PTFV1none).4,6,16,17 A high agreement between the automated and manual measurements of PTAV1 and PTDV1 was found (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). To reduce the impact of extreme outliers, patients with PTDV1 or PTAV1 values 99.75th percentile were excluded.
Among patients with abnormal PTFV1, the duration component PTDV1 and amplitude component PTAV1 were divided into tertiles. The cutoff values for PTDV1 were 38–69 ms (low); 70–77 ms (mid); and 78–97 ms (high). The cutoff values for absolute PTAV1 were 43–62 mV (low); 63–77 mV (mid); and 78–126 mV (high).
Outcome measures The primary outcomes were incident AF (ICD-10: I-48, atrial ﬁbrillation or ﬂutter) and stroke or TIA (ICD-10: I-63, I-64, G-45), with death as competing event.

Statistical analysis Categorical variables are given as frequency (percentage) and continuous variables as median with corresponding 25th–75th percentiles [p25–p75]. Accordingly, the c2 and Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to test for differences across study groups. Cumulative incidence curves were generated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator to illustrate the time trends in development of AF.
Among patients with PTFV1, a multivariate Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, congestive heart failure, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, other cardiac arrhythmias, other cardiac diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism (including thyrotoxicosis) was used to investigate the association between PTDV1 and PTAV1 individually and incident AF and stroke/ TIA, using the group of patients with normal terminal negative component in V1 (PTFV1-normal) and patients without a negative component (PTFV1-none) as a combined reference group. Comorbidities included congestive heart failure, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, other cardiac arrhythmias, other cardiac diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, diabetes, stroke/TIA, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism. Patients with stroke/TIA as comorbidity in relation to statistical analyses with stroke/TIA as primary outcome were excluded.
The interaction between variables was examined using likelihood ratio tests with a signiﬁcance level of P ,.01. No interaction between the PTDV1 and PTAV1 was present.
The linearity of continuous variables was also examined through likelihood ratio tests against adding cubic splines to continuous variables. Age was found to violate linearity and was consequently added as a categorical variable based on 20th percentiles (cutoff values at 46, 56, 63 and 72 years of age). Schoenfeld residuals were evaluated to test the assumption of the hazards proportionality and were fulﬁlled.
Using multivariable Cox regression, restricted cubic splines with 3 knots were added to display the hazard ratio (HR) of AF and stroke/TIA development as a function of PTDV1 and PTAV1 as continuous variables. The knots were added by computer optimized ﬁtting.
For the cubic splines, PTDV1 of 70 ms was used for the lowest PTAV1 tertile as reference for duration, and for amplitude an absolute value for PTAV1 of 70 mV was used for the lowest PTDV1 tertile.
The correlation between PTDV1 and PTAV1 was charted in a scatter plot, and the coefﬁcient of determination (r2) was calculated (Supplemental Figure 3).
All data management were performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and statistical analyses using R Core Team (2020). P ,.05 was considered signiﬁcant for all statistical analysis except for interactions, for which P ,.01 was used.

Figure 3 also shows that PTAV1 was less consistently associated with AF across tertiles than PTDV1. The HRs for AF in the low and high tertiles of PTAV1 were 1.20 (95% CI 1.09–1.32) and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04–1.27), respectively. In the mid tertile, the HR for AF was 1.03 (95% CI 0.92–1.16).
Figure 4 shows spline curves for PTAV1 and PTDV1 and the risk of AF. Figure 4A shows 1 spline curve for each tertile of PTAV1. The spline curves show an elevated risk of AF for PTDV1 .75 ms, and this risk was consistent across all PTAV1 tertiles but was more pronounced for the lowest and highest PTAV1 tertiles. Figure 4B shows 1 spline curve

for each tertile of PTDV1. The risk of AF increases additively according to higher PTDV1 tertiles with increasing PTAV1.
Figure 5 shows spline curves for PTAV1 and PTDV1 and the risk of stoke/TIA. Figure 5A shows spline curves for PTDV1 and the risk of stoke/TIA, 1 spline curve for each tertile of PTAV1. The highest PTAV1 tertile showed the strongest risk of stroke/TIA compared to the lowest and mid PTAV1 tertiles. Patients with stroke or TIA as comorbidity were excluded in relation to statistical analysis with stroke/ TIA as outcome. Figure 5B shows 1 spline curve for each tertile of PTDV1, with a dose–response like increased risk of stroke/TIA for PTDV1 consistent across all PTAV1 tertiles.
Risk of stroke/TIA Figure 3 shows the HR for stroke/TIA for the tertiles of PTDV1 and PTAV1 in patients with abnormal PTFV1 using normal/nonexistent PTDV1 as the reference group. Both mid and high PTDV1 tertiles had an increased risk of developing stroke/TIA (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03–1.19; and HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05–1.20, respectively). The lowest tertile of the PTDV1 was not associated with an increased risk of stroke/TIA (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92–1.10).
Figure 3 shows that the highest PTAV1 was associated with an increased risk of stroke/TIA (HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.14–1.29), whereas associations were weaker for the mid and lowest PTAV1 tertiles (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.99–1.13; and HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.99–1.14, respectively).
Figure 3 shows that the highest risk of stoke/TIA is found among the highest tertiles for PTAV1 and PTDV1.

mid tertile group were signiﬁcantly associated with AF. PTAV1 trended toward a weak incremental association to stroke/TIA. The interaction and correlation between PTDV1 and PTAV1 components were poor (Supplemental Figure 3).
Despite the highly selected nature of the population, when patients with different ECG pathologies possibly disposing for AF (eg, voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy) were excluded, associations between PTDV1 and AF and stroke/TIA were seen.
The presence of abnormal PTFV1 (4 mV$ms) is an indicator of left atrial abnormality in the form of enlargement, ﬁbrosis, and strain, and a leftward and posteriorly directed left atrial depolarization vector is responsible for the appearance of a negative PTF in lead V1.18,19 In addition, PTFV1 is more frequently reported with advancing age and increasing body mass index.4,20 Although often considered as evidence of left atrial enlargement, it has been suggested that prolonged interatrial conduction more consistently plays a role in the genesis of the ECG appearance of PTFV1.2 Another electrophysiological change seen among patients with AF is abnormal atrial repolarization, primarily seen as changes in the PTa and Ta segment on the ECG, although the amplitude generated by the altered repolarization may be too modest to manifest on the ECG.2,21
Furthermore, this study showed that AF and strokeassociated comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease, are overrepresented in patients with abnormal PTFV1 compared to patients with PTFV1none/PTFV1-normal. This ﬁnding is in line with Eranti et al,4 who found PTFV1 to be an indicator of elevated morbidity and mortality.
Our study demonstrated that patients with abnormal PTFV1 developed AF and stroke/TIA more frequently during the follow-up period than patients with normal or

nonexisting PTFV1. These ﬁndings expand on data
regarding the association between abnormal PTFV1 and
the higher risk of AF as previously described by Eranti et al,4 Soliman et al,17 and Tereshchenko et al.19 Eranti et al4 assessed the association between PTFV1 and AF and found that a value 6 mV$ms was associated with an increased risk of developing AF, whereas there was no significant relationship between PTFV1 4 mV$ms and AF. Tereshchenko et al19 deﬁned PTFV1 as the presence of biphasic
P wave with the amplitude of the terminal negative phase .100 mV, or 1 small box on ECG scale. They reported that PTFV1 was a common ﬁnding (67.4%) among an adult study population (45–64 years) and was associated with a 5-fold increased risk of AF. The latter ﬁnding was supported by Soliman et al,17 who found a clear association between
PTFV1 and AF in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) study. Based on the large ARIC study population, Kamel et al10 found PTFV1 to be associated with incident
ischemic stroke. The association between PTFV1 and stroke persisted despite adjustment for atrial ﬁbrillation.
In the present study, a dose–response relationship between
PTDV1 and AF was observed, with a duration of the terminal
negative component of the P wave in V1 exceeding 78 ms as the strongest indicator of AF (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.23 –1.52). Soliman et al17 reported PTDV1 to be the clearest indicator of
AF, consistent with the results of the present study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to examine the
relationship between PTDV1 and stroke/TIA. PTDV1 has been linked to the presence of atrial ﬁbrosis, a
well-known and important pathophysiological driver for atrial ﬁbrillation. Win et al22 found that diffuse left ventricular interstitial ﬁbrosis (and likely related left atrial ﬁbrosis)
predominantly affected PTDV1 than PTAV1.
Ischemic stroke is a feared consequence of AF, especially
because AF has been associated with more severe stroke

manifestations.23 Stroke often precedes the diagnosis of AF and has been linked to the presence of occult AF. PTFV1abnormal, particularly when generated by a long PTDV1, may be used as a predictor of ischemic stroke and AF in the clinical setting. Further studies will need to be undertaken in this regard.
Our study showed a U-shaped association between PTAV1 and AF. Several mechanisms could explain the less clear association between PTAV1 and the risk of AF and stroke/TIA found in our study. The amplitude of the terminal negative component of PTFV1 reﬂects a vector projection that can be altered through different factors, including the positioning of the heart and ECG electrode placement.24,25 PTAV1 has been linked to altered mechanical function, including increased left atrial volume and strain.22 Loew et al26 suggested through computational modeling that only PTAV1 was increased by left atrial hypertrophy. Furthermore, AF only accounts for about one-third of ischemic strokes27; thus, the presence of left atrial alterations generating PTFV1 may only be present in a certain proportion of stroke patients. This underscores the possibility for a less apparent association between the components of PTFV1 and stroke/TIA. Despite this, left atrial enlargement has also been associated with stroke in the absence of AF,28 thus underlining the importance of identifying left atrial enlargement.
Conceptually, increased PTAV1 may represent a more complex interplay among different stages of pathophysiological alterations, anatomic variability, and incorrect ECG electrode placement. This potentially lowers the reliability of PTAV1 as a predictor of AF and stroke/TIA compared to ,PTDV1 which is much less dependent on vector projections.24 This might explain some of the results in our study, in which we did not identify a clear dose–response relationship between PTAV1 and risk of AF, whereas the relationship trended more toward a dose–response relationship between PTAV1 and stroke/TIA (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 4).

Clinical implications The identiﬁcation of abnormal PTFV1, especially a signiﬁcant PTDV1, may be associated with an increased risk of developing AF and stroke/TIA. Registration of a signiﬁcant PTDV1 (eg, through machine learning algorithms) may allow for identiﬁcation of patients who may beneﬁt from strategies aimed at identifying and preventing AF, such as rhythm monitoring. Rhythm monitoring is a typical part of the diagnostic workup of patients with embolic stroke of unknown source. In this connection, artiﬁcial intelligence is increasingly being investigated as a tool for identifying ECG abnormalities such as AF.29–33 Evidence is equivocal, and some studies show a possibility of improved and costeffective detection of AF,30,31,33 whereas other studies d not in a clinical setting.32 In this matter, identiﬁcation PTFV1, especially driven by a long PTDV1, could serve as a valuable predictive tool in identifying patients who would beneﬁt from prolonged monitoring and who are at high risk for AF.
A prospective study evaluating the usefulness of PTFV1 and PTDV1 for identifying patients who may beneﬁt from AF risk factor modiﬁcation may be warranted. A registration of signiﬁcant PTDV1 and/or PTFV1 through machine learning algorithms may be warranted and may serve as a spur to future research.
Conclusion
In this study, we found a dose–response relationship between the duration of the terminal negative component of the P wave in lead V1 and the risk of incident AF and stroke/TIA among patients from a primary care setting. The amplitude of the terminal negative component of the P wave in V1 was less consistently associated with risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Measures of PTFV1, particularly duration measures, may be useful for identifying high-risk patients who could be targeted with cardiovascular prevention strategies.

Study strengths and limitations The main strength of this study is the ability to combine information from uniquely detailed registries on recorded ECGs, comorbidity, and concomitant pharmacotherapy. The primary limitation is largely related to the observational nature of the study, in that our ﬁndings are associations and may not necessarily be causal. Moreover, the lack of clinical information about possible lifestyle confounders (eg, body mass index, blood pressure, or substance abuse) may affect risk estimates. Other important limitations of this study are the lack of indications for ECG recording and medication, as well as the exact causes of death.
Of note, we used primary care patients, thus ensuring a lower degree of selection bias regarding patients with poor health status compared to studies of hospitalized patients, among whom morbidity and mortality are pronounced. Furthermore, Nielsen et al11 previously reported no healthy responder bias for patients at CGPL.
