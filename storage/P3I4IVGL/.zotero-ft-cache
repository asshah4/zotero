While pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy (CM) gene variants have been identified in 10% of Caucasians with early-onset AF and are associated with increased mortality, the prevalence of P/LP CM gene variants in ethnic minorities with AF remains unknown. Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing in 305 predominantly AA/HL individuals with AF at University of Illinois Health and Jesse Brown VA Medical Center. We examined 22 candidate genes strongly associated with CM and selected variants with appropriate read depths (≥ x20) with exclusion of multiallelic calls and genotype quality scores ≥20. Pathogenicity was determined by applying guideline-based criteria from the American College of Medical Genetics. Results: Among 305 patients (mean age 60 ± 14 years, 50% male, 65% AA, 34% HL), 12/305 (3.9%) carried P/LP variants in CM genes (Figure 1). Compared to patients without P/LP variants, those with P/LP variants had lower rates of hypertension (58% vs 85%, p=0.012) and higher rates of congestive heart failure (75% vs 37%, p=0.008). Conclusion: Disease-associated CM gene variants were found in 3.9% of AA/HL individuals with AF. These findings may provide valuable insight into the role of genetics in explaining differential AF prevalence and outcomes across race-ethnicity.
