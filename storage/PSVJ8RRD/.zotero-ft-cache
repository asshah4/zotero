Abstract 
Automatic evaluations are crucial for survival, but conscious self-reflection enables the formulation of nuanced evaluations to serve long-term goals. To operate effectively, both automatic and reflective evaluative processes need to integrate stored representations from previous experience (attitudes) with current contexts and goals, but contexts and goals have a more prominent role in reflective evaluation. Recent neuroimaging data provide new insights into the structure and function of evaluation and the dynamic ways that attitudes and reflective processing contribute to evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new iterative-reprocessing (IR) model of the neural bases of evaluation that highlights the role of the prefrontal cortex in the reprocessing of evaluative information. This model makes predictions that inform social-cognitive and cognitive-neuroscientific accounts of evaluation.

Abstract 
There is converging evidence from developmental and cognitive psychology, as well as from neuroscience, to suggest that the self is both special and social, and that self–other interaction is the driving force behind self-development. We review experimental findings which demonstrate that human infants are motivated for social interactions and suggest that the development of an awareness of other minds is rooted in the implicit notion that others are like the self. We then marshal evidence from functional neuroimaging explorations of the neurophysiological substrate of shared representations between the self and others, using various ecological paradigms such as mentally representing one’s own actions versus others’ actions, watching the actions executed by others, imitating the others’ actions versus being imitated by others. We suggest that within this shared neural network the inferior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere play a special role in the essential ability to distinguish the self from others, and in the way the self represents the other. Interestingly, the right hemisphere develops its functions earlier than the left.

Abstract 
Social cognitive neuroscience is an emerging discipline that seeks to explain the psychological and neural bases of socioemotional experience and behavior. Although research in some areas is already well developed (e.g. perception of nonverbal social cues) investigation in other areas has only just begun (e.g. social interaction). Current studies are elucidating; the role of the amygdala in a variety of evaluative and social judgment processes, the role of medial prefrontal cortex in mental state attribution, how frontally mediated controlled processes can regulate perception and experience, and the way in which these and other systems are recruited during social interaction. Future progress will depend upon the development of programmatic lines of research that integrate contemporary social cognitive research with cognitive neuroscience theory and methodology.

Abstract 
Throughout the life span, environmental factors, genetic factors, the individual's actions and experiences, and inevitable changes in the functioning of neurobiological mechanisms interact to produce a range of effects on the cognitive abilities of individuals as they grow older. Some individuals show only minor deficits in particular forms of cognition as they grow older, while other individuals show substantial declines in various aspects of memory and learning. Healthy older adults usually show deficits in particular situations such as those that require the management and coordination of multiple tasks or that involve detailed recollection of events or experiences. Age-related deficits are most prominent in cognitive tasks that are particularly dependent on hippocampal and prefrontal brain circuitry. This article discusses normal age-related changes in learning and memory from a cognitive neuroscience perspective.

Abstract 
Recently, cognitive neuroscience methods have been applied to some of the major issues in infant and child development. Three perspectives on human postnatal functional brain development are presented, and their application to three domains reviewed: the developing social brain, speech and language development, and prefrontal cortex functions. In all domains, evidence is consistent with an ‘interactive specialization’ view on development in which cortical regions become increasingly specifically tuned for computational functions as a result of postnatal experience.

Abstract 
Most cognitive neuroscience research to date has focused on brain mechanisms. We can gain additional insights into the neural basis of cognition and action by considering how this finely tuned organ came to be, both from an evolutionary and a developmental perspective. This article focuses primarily on developmental and evolutionary changes in higher cognitive functions, in particular the ability to reason about the world and about others’ mental states. These functions are supported by neural circuits involving prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that has expanded over evolution and that develops slowly over childhood and adolescence in humans.

Abstract 
All animals attach positive value to stimuli associated with rewards and reproduce actions that lead to positive outcomes. The unique features of reward processes in primates involve the contributions of the granular prefrontal cortex. These areas, the most prominent parts of the prefrontal cortex in primates, lack homologs in other mammals. Together with other cortical areas, the granular prefrontal cortex produces a uniquely primate way of processing rewards, and it does so in large part through its interactions with the amygdala and basal ganglia.

Abstract 
Limbic forebrain regions are anatomically positioned to integrate cortical and subcortical processing streams that mediate cognitive and emotional functions. Feedback projections to sensory cortices bias perceptual systems to process stimuli of high significance. The amygdala is critical for learning contingencies in the environment that predict emotional outcomes and for modulating explicit memory processes in the hippocampus. The anterior cingulate gyrus and ventromedial and orbital prefrontal cortices serve as interfaces that link emotional information processing and attentional control systems to guide goal-directed behavior. Dysregulation of the balance between affective and cognitive systems is a hallmark of anxiety and mood disorders.
