Keywords: sickle cell disease, red cell transfusion, indications.
Red cell transfusion has an important role in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) in both emergency and elective settings. However, because of insufﬁcient randomised data, it is not always clear when or how to use red cell transfusion. A companion guideline, Guidelines on red cell transfusion in sickle cell disease Part I: principles and laboratory aspects, addresses the general principles of transfusion practice in SCD (Davis et al, 2016, BJH in press). The present guideline examines current available evidence on indications for transfusion in SCD. This may not be appropriate for all clinical scenarios and clinical decisions must be based on individual patient considerations.
In both guidelines, the term sickle cell disease refers to all genotypes of the disease, and sickle cell anaemia to the homozygous state (SS).
Methods
The writing group was selected by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) General Haematology and Transfusion Task Forces with input from other experts in Haemoglobinopathy. PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase were searched systematically for publications on red cell transfusion in SCD from 1960 to May 2016 using a combination of search terms related to: (i) sickle cell (including sickle, sickle cell, sickle cell disease, sickle cell anaemia, haemoglobin SC disease, sickle cell crisis), (ii) transfusion (including transfusion, blood transfusion, red cell transfusion), (iii) transfusion indications (including aplastic crisis, parvovirus, sequestration (splenic, liver, hepatic), acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, silent cerebral infarcts, multi-organ

failure, girdle syndrome, intrahepatic cholestasis, surgery, pregnancy, and (iv) transfusion complications (including alloimmunisation, haemolytic transfusion reactions, iron overload, viral infections). Opinions were also sought from experienced haematologists with a special interest in the care of SCD patients. The guideline was reviewed by the members of the General Haematology Task Force of the BCSH prior to being sent to a sounding board of approximately 50 UK haematologists, the BCSH and the British Society for Haematology (BSH) Committee. Comments were incorporated where appropriate. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) nomenclature was used to evaluate levels of evidence and to assess the strength of recommendations. The GRADE criteria are speciﬁed in the BCSH guidance pack http://www.bcshguidelines. com/BCSH_PROCESS/EVIDENCE_LEVELS_AND_GRADES_OF_RECOMMENDATION/43_GRADE.html and the GRADE working group website http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org.
Key recommendations
Consideration of sickle cell patients for transfusion, particularly long-term regimens, should weigh up the potential beneﬁts against potential risks (Grade 1C).
Cerebrovascular disease. Regular transfusion to maintain HbS <30% should be offered as initial treatment to children with SS or S/bo thalassaemia aged 2–16 years judged to be at high risk for a ﬁrst stroke on the basis of Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) (Grade 1A).
Hydroxycarbamide treatment should be considered for the primary prevention of stroke in children with sickle cell anaemia and high TCD velocities but not severe Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)-deﬁned cerebral vasculopathy after an initial period of transfusions (Grade 1A). The duration of the initial period of transfusion should be tailored to the individual patient but should be for a minimum of 1 year; the transition to

hydroxycarbamide should be done gradually and transfusion should be withdrawn after the hydroxycarbamide has been escalated to the maximum tolerated dose.
Regular transfusion to maintain HbS <30% effectively reduces the incidence of recurrence of cerebral infarction (deﬁned as a stroke or a new or enlarged silent cerebral infarct) in children with sickle cell anaemia and S/bo thalassaemia aged 5–15 years. Treatment options including transfusion should be discussed with families of children who are found to have silent cerebral infarcts. Transfusion should be offered to children who are identiﬁed to be at greatest risk for recurrence of infarction after discussion of its beneﬁts and risks (Grade 1A).
Long-term transfusion to maintain HbS <30% is recommended for the prevention of recurrent ischaemic stroke due to sickle cell disease in both children and adults (Grade 1B).
Adults or children who present with signs or symptoms suggestive of acute ischaemic stroke should be transfused without any delay to maintain HbS <30% pending further investigation. Those with conﬁrmed stroke due to sickle cell disease should continue regular transfusions long-term (Grade 1B).
Surgery. Preoperative transfusion is recommended for SS patients undergoing medium-risk surgery (e.g. abdominal, tonsillectomy, orthopaedic) (Grade 1A).
Preoperative transfusion is recommended for SC patients undergoing medium-risk surgery (e.g. abdominal, tonsillectomy, orthopaedic) (Grade 1C).
Transfusion is recommended for sickle cell patients of all genotypes requiring high-risk surgery (e.g. cardiovascular, brain) (Grade 1C).
All sickle cell patients with other genotypes undergoing surgery should be individually assessed, taking into account previous history and complexity of surgery, and a management plan should be formulated to include the need for transfusion (Grade 1C).
Particular care should be taken to ensure that all aspects of perioperative care, including oxygenation, hydration, warmth and anaesthetic and surgical technique, are optimised in all sickle cell patients undergoing surgery (Grade 1C).
For patients requiring emergency surgery, the urgency and complexity of the procedure should be taken into account in the timing of perioperative transfusion. Simple transfusion should be given preoperatively if Hb <90 g/l provided this will not result in undue delay to surgery. If transfusion is likely to cause an unacceptable delay to surgery, it is reasonable to proceed to surgery while arranging to transfuse the patient intra- or post-operatively if necessary (Grade 1D).
Acutely ill patients. Transfusion is recommended and may be life-saving in acute sickle complications such as splenic sequestration, hepatic sequestration, aplastic crisis and severe acute chest syndrome (Grade 1B).

Guideline
Transfusion should be considered in the unwell patient with acute multi-organ failure, mesenteric syndrome (Grade 1C) and patients with severe sepsis (Grade 2C). Such cases should be discussed with the specialist haemoglobinopathy team (SHT).
Transfusion for other causes of acute anaemia requires individual assessment and should be discussed with the SHT. Transfusion may be given by simple transfusion (top up) or exchange depending on clinical severity under the guidance of the SHT (Grade 2C).
Pregnancy. Prophylactic transfusion is not routinely required for sickle pregnancy, but should be considered for women with: • previous or current medical, obstetric or fetal problems
related to SCD • women previously on hydroxycarbamide because of
severe disease • multiple pregnancy (Grade 1C).
Women on long-term transfusions for stroke prevention or for amelioration of severe sickle complications should continue with regular transfusions throughout pregnancy (Grade 1B).
Transfusion should be considered in women with worsening anaemia or those with acute SCD complications (acute chest syndrome, stroke etc.) (Grade 1B).
Amelioration of severe disease. In selected patients with severe disease, blood transfusion can be effective in ameliorating disease, resulting in reduction in hospital bed days. Hydroxycarbamide is recommended as ﬁrst line treatment for prevention of recurrent acute chest syndrome or repeated painful episodes associated with chest syndrome (Grade 1A). Regular transfusion should be considered for patients failing this treatment or for whom hydroxycarbamide is contraindicated or not acceptable (Grade 1B).
Other indications. Transfusion is not recommended to treat steady state anaemia provided that Hb has not fallen over a period of time to symptomatic levels (e.g. with developing chronic kidney disease) (Grade 1C).
There is no evidence that transfusion shortens the duration of a painful crisis.
Transfusion is not recommended in uncomplicated painful crises but should be considered if there is a substantial drop in Hb from baseline (e.g. >20 g/l or to Hb <50 g/l), haemodynamic compromise or concern about impending critical organ complications (Grade 1C).
The beneﬁt of transfusion to relieve established acute priapism has not been shown in randomised controlled trials. Many patients require a shunt or drainage procedure under general anaesthesia, which may require a transfusion. Such cases should be discussed with the SHT (Grade 2C).
Transfusion has been shown to reduce the incidence of symptomatic avascular necrosis in children receiving regular
193

Guideline

transfusions to maintain HbS <30% for prevention of recurrence of cerebral infarction (Grade 1A). However, there is no consensus on the use of transfusion for the sole purpose of preventing this complication in routine practice.
Where transfusion is considered for indications where there is insufﬁcient evidence for its beneﬁt (e.g. leg ulcers, pulmonary hypertension, end stage renal or liver disease, progressive sickle cell retinopathy), a full riskbeneﬁt assessment should be carried out in liaison with the SHT and each case should be considered on its own merits (Grade 2C).
Indications for transfusion in sickle cell disease
The indications for red cell transfusion in SCD range from those in which transfusion can be strongly recommended to those where its use is unproven or controversial. A case-bycase detailed analysis of risk and beneﬁt of red cell

transfusion should be undertaken for unproven or controversial indications.
The indications can be broadly categorised into conditions in which correction of anaemia is the main goal and those where reduction of sickle haemoglobin (HbS) may be more appropriate (see Table I). In both categories, transfusion is either performed acutely, as part of the management of an acute complication of SCD, or electively for the prevention or management of disease complications. Elective transfusions may be one-off (e.g. preoperative) or be part of a longterm transfusion programme.
The decision to transfuse any patient with SCD should be taken by senior medical staff, ideally at consultant level with the appropriate experience. Long-term elective transfusions should usually be initiated by or in consultation with a SHT.
It should be recognised that the low steady state Hb in SCD is the result of the low oxygen afﬁnity of haemoglobin S and is therefore not in itself an indication or transfusion.

Indications for emergency transfusion
Emergency transfusion with the primary aim of correcting acute anaemia
Ascertaining the cause of anaemia. Acute anaemia in SCD has been deﬁned as a fall in haemoglobin ≥20 g/l below the steady state value (Emond et al, 1985; NHLBI, 2014). Understanding the cause of the anaemia is essential for appropriate management. Causes broadly include: decreased haemoglobin production, sequestration and increased haemolysis. Initial assessment should include: history of recent transfusion, haemodynamic status, spleen and liver size, full blood count and reticulocyte count. Any decision to transfuse should take into consideration the likely cause, haemodynamic status and degree of anaemia relative to baseline.
Aplastic crisis. Aplastic crisis should be suspected in patients with acute exacerbation of steady state anaemia with reticulocytopenia and is usually due to infection with human erythrovirus (formerly parvovirus) B19 (Pattison et al, 1981; Serjeant et al, 1981, 1993; Goldstein et al, 1987). Anaemia is usually severe with a mean fall of approximately 40 g/l below steady state values (Goldstein et al, 1987; Serjeant et al, 2001).
Simple transfusion to steady state level is usually all that is required to maintain the oxygen carrying capacity of blood (Goldstein et al, 1987; Serjeant et al, 1993; Smith-Whitley et al, 2004). Spontaneous resumption of erythropoiesis tends to occur within 7–10 days of aplasia (Anderson et al, 1985), restoring the Hb to the steady state value. Most patients will be close to spontaneous marrow recovery at the time of clinical presentation with development of reticulocytosis and recovery of Hb occurring <7 days from presentation (Serjeant et al, 1993).
Erythrovirus B19 may occasionally present with serious and potentially life-threatening complications, including acute splenic sequestration, ACS (Lowenthal et al, 1996; Smith-Whitley et al, 2004) or acute neurological syndromes including stroke (Balkaran et al, 1992; Wierenga et al, 2001). In such cases, exchange transfusion after initial simple transfusion may be more appropriate.
Acute splenic sequestration. Acute splenic sequestration is characterised by an acute fall in Hb ≥20 g/l, reticulocytosis and sudden splenic enlargement (Emond et al, 1985) and, in severe cases, may result in circulatory failure and even death (Rogers et al, 1978; Emond et al, 1985). Although splenic sequestration typically occurs in the ﬁrst 5 years of life (Topley et al, 1981) before the spleen has spontaneously infarcted, it may occasionally occur later, particularly in those with milder disease such as SC disease in whom splenic infarction may not occur until later in life (Roshkow & Sanders, 1990; Aslam et al, 2005). Immediate management consists of simple transfusion to raise the Hb to steady state level (Emond

Guideline
et al, 1985). Transfusion with emergency (O Rh (D) negative) or ABO- and Rh (D)-speciﬁc uncrossmatched blood may occasionally be necessary to treat shock and anaemia in extremis. In many cases, however, cautious transfusion of small red cell volumes to raise the haemoglobin to the steady state level is sufﬁcient to reverse the process and correct hypovolaemia and anaemia. Transfusion of large volumes of red cells (to Hb levels >80 g/l) should be avoided due to the risk of hyperviscosity when sequestered red cells return to the circulation (Kinney et al, 1990; Wanko & Telen, 2005; Josephson et al, 2007; Quirolo, 2010; NHLBI 2014).
All patients with previous splenic sequestration should be discussed with the SHT. There is a high recurrence rate (Emond et al, 1985; Brousse et al, 2012) and splenectomy is advised in patients who have recurrent episodes (two or more). Splenectomy is not associated with an increased longterm risk of bacteraemic episodes or death (Wright et al, 1999). Regular transfusion to maintain HbS <30% did not reduce the risk of recurrence or need for splenectomy after splenic sequestration compared to clinical observation in a retrospective observational study (Kinney et al, 1990).
Acute hepatic sequestration. Acute hepatic sequestration presents with acute hepatic enlargement associated with a fall in Hb ≥20 g/l and rise in the reticulocyte count. It usually responds to simple transfusion or exchange transfusion (Gutteridge et al, 1985; Hatton et al, 1985); spontaneous resolution has been reported (Hatton et al, 1985). As in acute splenic sequestration, the return of sequestered red cells into the circulation may cause acute hyperviscosity (Lee & Chu, 1996) and cautious transfusion of small volumes of red cells is recommended.
Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (classical and hyperhaemolysis syndrome). A delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) (classical or hyperhaemolysis) must be strongly suspected in patients presenting with acute anaemia with/without pain typical of vaso-occlusive crisis following a recent transfusion (Milner et al, 1985; King et al, 1997; Petz et al, 1997). Hyperhaemolysis may be missed because it is assumed that the patient’s symptoms are due entirely to a painful crisis. The investigation and management of these two syndromes have been described in the companion guideline, Guidelines on red cell transfusion in sickle cell disease Part I: principles and laboratory aspects (Davis et al, 2016; BJH in press).
All cases of DHTR should be discussed with the SHT both for advice on management and because of the long-term implications of alloimmunisation and risk of hyperhaemolysis recurrence.
Increased haemolysis during painful crises. Transfusion is not recommended in uncomplicated painful crises. Although Hb often drops to slightly below steady state levels, transfusion is typically not required and Hb will return to baseline as the
195

Guideline
crisis abates. Transfusion may be indicated if there is a substantial drop in Hb from baseline (e.g. >20 g/l or Hb < 50 g/ l), haemodynamic compromise or concern about impending critical organ complications (see below).
Other causes of exacerbation of anaemia. An acute decline in Hb due to haemolysis is common in acute sickle complications, such as ACS (Howard et al, 2015) and acute multiorgan failure syndrome (Hassell et al, 1994). The role of transfusion in these two syndromes is described in sections Acute chest syndrome (ACS) and Acute multi-organ failure syndrome. Urgent transfusion is indicated for acute blood loss.
Severe anaemia during hydroxycarbamide therapy requiring transfusion is usually due to an acute intercurrent illness, such as acute splenic sequestration, aplastic crisis or ACS rather than the myelosuppressive effects of the drug (Scott et al, 1996; Kinney et al, 1999; Wang et al, 2001; Gulbis et al, 2005; Hankins et al, 2005a). The effects of myelosuppression are usually reversible rapidly upon reduction of the dose or temporary cessation of hydroxycarbamide but full recovery may not occur for several weeks (Wang et al, 2001; Hankins et al, 2005a).
In patients with sickle cell nephropathy, a slow decline of haemoglobin concentration occurs as the renal disease progresses and the anaemia may be severe enough to compromise cardiovascular function (Serjeant & Serjeant, 2001).
Recommendations
Simple transfusion to steady state haemoglobin concentration is indicated for patients with acute exacerbation of anaemia as a result of aplastic crisis or sequestration crisis (Grade 1B). Over-transfusion (to Hb > 80 g/l) should be avoided in sequestration crises because of the risk of hyperviscosity due to the re-entry of sequestered red cells into the circulation.
Transfusion is not recommended in uncomplicated vaso-occlusive crisis but should be considered if there is worsening anaemia, haemodynamic compromise or concern about impending critical organ complications (Grade 1C).
Transfusion for other causes of acute anaemia requires individual assessment and should be discussed with the SHT (Grade 1C).
Emergency transfusion with the primary aim of reducing HbS in relation to HbA
Transfusion to reduce the %HbS is indicated where there is evidence of acute critical organ complications, especially ACS and ischaemic stroke.
Acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS usually develops during a painful crisis and should be suspected in patients presenting
196

with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, together with clinical signs of lung consolidation (Howard et al, 2015). Early recognition of ACS and intervention with blood transfusion can be life-saving.
ACS can develop rapidly and progress to acute respiratory failure within a few hours. It is advisable to plan to have blood available if early signs of ACS occur, even if other measures subsequently render transfusion unnecessary. Both simple and exchange transfusion rapidly improved oxygenation with similar efﬁcacy in non-randomised studies (Vichinsky et al, 2000; Turner et al, 2009). A simple transfusion aiming for a target Hb 100–110 g/l is effective in preventing progression to acute respiratory failure in SS patients with mild ACS if it is given early in the illness (Emre et al, 1995) and should be considered in patients with a PaO2 < 9Á0 kPa on room air, but may also be needed at less severe degrees of hypoxaemia, depending on the individual patient’s history and clinical features, or if the patient’s oxygen requirements are increasing (Howard et al, 2015). Exchange transfusion is recommended in patients with features of severe ACS, those who fail to respond to initial simple transfusion, or patients with a higher Hb (>90 g/l) where there is little leeway for simple transfusion (Emre et al, 1995; Vichinsky et al, 1997; NHLBI 2014; Howard et al, 2015).
There is no evidence as to the optimal %HbS target postexchange transfusion. In practice, a target of <30–40% is often used, but clinicians should be guided by the clinical response (Howard et al, 2015).
Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ACS are available from the BCSH (Howard et al, 2015).
Acute ischaemic stroke. The value of transfusion and the comparative effects of exchange versus simple transfusion in acute ischaemic stroke have not been evaluated in randomised trials. Emergency exchange transfusion to reduce HbS to <30% is recommended for acute ischaemic stroke (RCP, 2004; Sickle Cell Society 2008; NHLBI 2014). Initial simple transfusion should be given if the stroke has occurred in the context of severe acute anaemia (e.g. in aplastic crisis) (RCP 2004). Although there are no controlled trials on the effect of transfusion on the stroke itself, red cell transfusion may potentially minimise morbidity and mortality by improving perfusion and oxygenation to the brain, thereby preventing extension of an infarct. There is evidence from a retrospective cohort study that exchange transfusion for a ﬁrst overt stroke at the time of stroke presentation is associated with a lower risk of a subsequent stroke compared to simple transfusion (Hulbert et al, 2006). It is important to avoid hypovolaemia during the procedure and to keep the post-transfusion Hb at a target of 100 g/l, as a high haematocrit associated with hyperviscosity may worsen the neurological insult.
Current pathways for acute stroke care in the UK require adult patients with suspected stroke to be admitted directly to specialist stroke units (hyperacute stroke units) (NICE,
ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd British Journal of Haematology, 2017, 176, 192–209

2008). National Health Service (NHS) Trusts must ensure that governance arrangements are in place to provide specialist haemoglobinopathy care for SCD patients with suspected stroke who are admitted to hyperacute stroke units, so that emergency exchange transfusion can be provided in a timely manner. Although this model of care has not been developed for paediatrics, NHS Trusts must develop local protocols with the collaboration of their SHT so that SCD children with acute stroke can receive appropriate care, including timely exchange transfusion and specialist neurology advice (RCP 2004; Dick, 2010).
There are currently no data to support the use of red cell transfusion either in the acute management of haemorrhagic stroke or to prevent its recurrence and it is recommended that specialist advice should be sought for individual cases.
Acute multi-organ failure syndrome. This is a severe lifethreatening syndrome that may complicate a severe painful crisis. It is particularly likely to occur in patients with otherwise mild SCD and a relatively high haemoglobin concentration. The patient presents with multi-organ failure with associated fever, rapid decrements in Hb and platelet count, non-focal encephalopathy and rhabdomyolysis. The syndrome usually responds to aggressive exchange transfusion (Hassell et al, 1994).
Mesenteric (“girdle”) syndrome. This is a rare severe sequestration syndrome characterised by simultaneous or consecutive sickling and sequestration in the mesenteric vascular bed, liver and lungs (Brozovic et al, 1987). Preceding pain in the abdomen, lumbar spine and limbs is common. Sickling in the abdomen can present with tenderness and rigidity, mimicking peritonitis and progressing to ileus, with a silent distended abdomen and dilated loops of bowel on X-ray. ACS frequently develops due to splinting of the chest wall. Acute exchange blood transfusion is indicated.
Severe sepsis. Severe sepsis often engenders a vicious circle of tissue hypoxia, acidosis and sickling. An exchange transfusion or simple transfusion may be useful in correcting anaemia, improving microvascular blood ﬂow, tissue oxygenation and the patient’s overall clinical condition (Ohene-Frempong, 2001).
Acute intrahepatic cholestasis. This is a rare and little understood complication that presents with extreme hyperbilirubinaemia (mainly conjugated) (Banerjee et al, 2001; Gardner et al, 2014), marked elevation of the alkaline phosphatase and variable rises in transaminase levels. There is a high mortality from liver failure or bleeding. There is no established treatment but exchange transfusion appears to be beneﬁcial (Shao & Orringer, 1995).
Acute priapism. The treatment of priority in acute fulminant priapism is penile aspiration/irrigation followed by the
ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd British Journal of Haematology, 2017, 176, 192–209

Guideline
intracavernosal injection of sympathomimetic drugs if aspiration fails to resolve the problem (Montague et al, 2003). This initial urological intervention should not be delayed while a transfusion is arranged.
Neither simple nor exchange transfusion have been evaluated for acute management of priapism in randomised controlled trials. Small case series and literature reviews provide no evidence of amelioration of pain or duration of priapism once this has been established (McCarthy et al, 2000; Merritt et al, 2006). Surgical management is indicated if initial urological measures are not effective (Montague et al, 2003). Shunt procedures for the relief of acute priapism require a general anaesthetic so that the patient may beneﬁt from transfusion, as with other surgical procedures (Howard et al, 2013). If patients do not respond to initial shunt procedures there may be beneﬁt from exchange transfusion to decrease %HbS. Local hospitals should develop referral pathways so that patients requiring specialist surgery are transferred promptly to tertiary centres. Such patients must be discussed with the SHT with regards to possible transfusion preoperatively.
Recommendations
Transfusion is recommended in cases of acute chest syndrome with hypoxia. Transfusion may be given by simple or exchange transfusion depending on clinical severity under the guidance of the SHT (Grade 1B).
Adults or children with signs or symptoms suggestive of acute ischaemic stroke should be transfused to sickle haemoglobin (HbS) <30% pending further investigation. Those with conﬁrmed stroke due to sickle cell disease should continue regular transfusions indeﬁnitely (Grade 1B).
Transfusion should be considered in the unwell patient with acute multi-organ failure, mesenteric syndrome (Grade 1C) and patients with severe sepsis (Grade 2C). Such cases should be discussed with the SHT.
The beneﬁt of transfusion to relieve established acute priapism has not been shown in randomised controlled trials. Many patients require a shunt or drainage procedure under general anaesthesia, which may require a transfusion. Such cases should be discussed with the SHT (Grade 2C).
Indications for chronic transfusion
The best data to support chronic transfusion programmes are for the primary prevention of stroke (Adams et al, 1998; Adams & Brambilla, 2005) and secondary prevention of silent cerebral infarcts in paediatric populations (DeBaun et al, 2014). There is also good evidence for the effectiveness of transfusions in preventing recurrent stroke in children (Pegelow et al, 1995; Scothorn et al, 2002).
Chronic exchange transfusion has been utilised for a wide variety of indications, including prevention of recurrent vaso-occlusive crises and recurrent chest syndrome. In many
197

Guideline
of these circumstances there is also evidence of beneﬁt of hydroxycarbamide therapy (Charache et al, 1995; Thornburg et al, 2012) and chronic transfusion should only be contemplated where hydroxycarbamide is ineffective or contra-indicated.
Where chronic transfusion is initiated outside the context of paediatric stroke, the parameters to assess efﬁcacy should be clearly documented and the risks and beneﬁts for the patient regularly reviewed. Outcomes of chronic transfusion programmes should be regularly audited across centres. Decisions to initiate chronic transfusion should be made by the SHT.
Primary and secondary stroke prevention
Long-term red cell transfusion is the mainstay of treatment for the primary and secondary prevention of stroke due to SCD. Evidence for the efﬁcacy of transfusion for primary stroke prevention is available only for children but the principles may be relevant for adult patients (over 16 years).
Primary stroke prevention in children with SCD. Regular red cell transfusion to maintain HbS level <30% is indicated for the primary prevention of stroke in children (2–16 years) with SS or S/bo thalassaemia with time averaged mean TCD velocities of ≥200 cm/s in the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia study – STOP) (Adams et al, 1998). Regular red cell transfusion reduced the risk of an initial stroke by 92% (Adams et al, 1998), This was conﬁrmed in the Optimizing Primary Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP2) Trial, where children whose transfusions were discontinued were more likely to have a stroke or to revert to abnormal TCD velocities than those who continued on regular transfusion (Adams & Brambilla, 2005).
The role of hydroxycarbamide in maintaining normal TCD velocities in children without severe cerebral vasculopathy or prior transient ischaemic attack (TIA) who have received transfusions for at least 1 year (mean 4 years) for primary stroke prevention has recently been investigated in the TCD With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (TWiTCH) trial (Ware et al, 2016). In this randomised trial, hydroxycarbamide at maximum tolerated dose (alternative group) was compared to standard transfusions (standard group) after patients randomised to hydroxycarbamide had been slowly weaned off transfusions over 4–9 months. This trial showed that hydroxycarbamide is non-inferior to transfusions for the maintenance of TCD velocities and can be used as a substitute to help prevent primary stroke after discontinuation of initial transfusion therapy.
Recommendations
Transfusion to maintain HbS <30% should be offered to children at high risk of stroke following Transcranial
198

Doppler (TCD) screening. Transfusion is the recommended initial treatment to prevent stroke in such children (Grade 1A).
Hydroxycarbamide treatment should be considered for the primary prevention of stroke in children with high TCD velocities but not severe MRA-deﬁned cerebral vasculopathy after an initial period of transfusion of at least 1 year (Grade 1A). The duration of the initial period of transfusion should be tailored to the individual patient; the transition to hydroxycarbamide should be done gradually and transfusion should be withdrawn after the hydroxycarbamide has been escalated to the maximum tolerated dose.
Secondary prevention of silent cerebral infarction in children with SCD. The role of transfusion in the management of children with sickle cell anaemia aged 5–15 years (median 10 years) with silent cerebral infarcts was investigated in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Multi-Center Clinical Trial (SIT) (DeBaun et al, 2014). In this randomised trial, children with SS or S/bo thalassaemia with silent cerebral infarcts and normal or conditional TCD velocities were randomised to receive monthly transfusions to a target Hb of 90 g/l and HbS <30% or standard care (observation group) for 3 years. The primary endpoint was recurrence of infarction, deﬁned as a stroke, or new or enlarged silent cerebral infarct. The transfused group had a relative risk reduction of recurrence of infarction of 58% compared to the observation group; however, this was mainly due to a reduction in stroke incidence rather than a reduction in silent infarcts by transfusions. The authors recommended a screening Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to identify children who may beneﬁt from medical or educational intervention (DeBaun et al, 2014). However, MRI is difﬁcult to perform without sedation in children <7 years old, the age group in which the majority of silent cerebral infarcts occur.
Recommendation
Treatment options including transfusion should be discussed with families of children who are found to have silent cerebral infarcts. Transfusion should be offered to children who are identiﬁed as being at greatest risk for recurrence of infarction after discussion of its beneﬁts and risks (Grade 1A).
Secondary prevention of overt stroke in children with SCD. The risk of recurrent stroke in children with SCD is very high. In a natural history study of 35 patients with a history of one or more strokes, the recurrence rate was 67% over a 9-year period, with 80% of the recurrent episodes occurring within 36 months of the initial event (Powars et al, 1978).
There have been no randomised trials comparing the use of transfusion to no intervention for prevention of recurrent stroke in SCD. Several single centre studies (Lusher et al,
ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd British Journal of Haematology, 2017, 176, 192–209

1976; Sarnaik et al, 1979; Russell et al, 1984; Balkaran et al, 1992) and two multi-centre retrospective studies (Pegelow et al, 1995; Scothorn et al, 2002) all reported a clear beneﬁt of transfusion in reducing the risk of recurrence in patients who had suffered one or more previous episodes of cerebral infarction.
In the Stroke With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) trial, a non-inferiority trial that compared transfusion to HbS <30% plus chelation with hydroxycarbamide plus phlebotomy for the composite endpoint of secondary stroke prevention and improved control of iron overload, there were no cases of recurrent stroke in the transfused patients compared with 10% in the hydroxycarbamide/phlebotomy arm (Ware et al, 2012). The trial was closed early because even though the increased stroke risk in the hydroxycarbamide arm was within the predicted 12% rate, it was not offset by a reduction in iron overload through phlebotomy. Therefore, the authors concluded that transfusion and chelation remain a better way to manage children with sickle cell anaemia, stroke and iron overload.
Although the risk of stroke is not completely eliminated by regular transfusions (Pegelow et al, 1995; Scothorn et al, 2002; Hulbert et al, 2011), transfusions to maintain HbS <30% remains the recommended intervention to prevent stroke recurrence in children with SCD. There is some evidence from a small observational study that patients on transfusion programmes for secondary stroke prevention may be maintained on a less rigorous target of HbS <50% with little increased risk of stroke recurrence, provided they have been neurologically stable for at least 4 years after the initial stroke (Cohen et al, 1992).
Recommendation
Long-term transfusion to maintain HbS <30% is recommended for the prevention of recurrent ischaemic stroke due to sickle cell disease in children (Grade 1B).
Primary stroke prevention in adults with SCD. Adults with sickle cell anaemia are at increased risk of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke; the risk of ischaemic stroke is highest after the age of 30 years, whereas haemorrhagic stroke is most common in the 20–29 year age group (Ohene-Frempong et al, 1998). TCD has not been validated in adults and there is currently no tool for systematically assessing stroke risk. Studies to evaluate the efﬁcacy of transfusion for primary stroke prevention in deﬁned adult SCD populations have not been undertaken. There are no studies on the management of patients who, having been on long-term transfusions for primary stroke prevention since childhood, have crossed the transition threshold and become adults. Management of such patients is a subject for individual assessment, and discussion with young adults and carers should take place concerning the beneﬁts and risks of remaining on transfusion or substituting with hydroxycarbamide.

Guideline
Secondary stroke prevention in adults with SCD. Whilst neurological events, such as TIA or seizures, may be the initial presentation of sickle cell cerebrovascular disease, adults experiencing such episodes should be fully investigated for other possible causes (e.g. atrial ﬁbrillation, carotid artery stenosis). Data on transfusion for secondary stroke prevention in adult SCD is limited. An observational study (Powars et al, 1978) that included some adult subjects strongly suggests that the risk of further strokes is likely to be high without intervention. Current practice is to perform chronic transfusions in adults who have suffered a stroke attributable to SCD (Sickle Cell Society 2008; NHLBI 2014).
Recommendation
Long-term transfusion to maintain HbS <30% is recommended for the prevention of recurrent ischaemic stroke due to sickle cell disease in adults (Grade 1B).
Duration of transfusions for stroke prevention. The optimal duration of transfusion is uncertain. Data from the STOP 2 trial indicated that patients who were maintained on transfusion for a follow up period of 65 months for primary stroke prevention had a 93% lower stroke risk than patients who discontinued transfusions after 30 months (Adams & Brambilla, 2005). The results of the TWiTCH trial show that hydroxycarbamide is efﬁcacious and non-inferior to blood transfusions for primary stroke prevention in children without severe cerebral vasculopathy or prior TIA who have been on transfusion for at least a year (mean 4 years) (Ware et al, 2016). However, the trial did not establish the optimal duration of transfusions prior to the switchover to hydroxycarbamide. Therefore, we suggest that the duration of this initial period of transfusions is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
For patients who have had a stroke, the risk of recurrent stroke is highest in the ﬁrst 3 years after the initial event (Powars et al, 1978; Russell et al, 1984; Balkaran et al, 1992; Pegelow et al, 1995), suggesting that maintaining a HbS level <30% is especially important during this period. The beneﬁts of transfusions beyond this period are debatable. Recurrent stroke has been reported within 12 months of prospectively stopping transfusions in 5 out of 10 children who had been on a transfusion programme for as long as 9Á5 years (Wang et al, 1991). Therefore, transfusion for secondary stroke prevention may need to continue indeﬁnitely (Sickle Cell Society 2008; NHLBI 2014), but the decision to continue transfusions should be tailored to the needs of individual patients; it should be regularly reviewed and risk/beneﬁt considerations must be discussed with the patient and/or parents. It has been suggested that where the stroke has occurred in the context of acute illness (e.g. aplastic crisis), transfusions may be discontinued after 2 years if repeat vascular imaging is normal at that time (RCP 2004).

Guideline
Recommendation
Transfusion is the recommended initial treatment of choice for children at high risk of stroke based on TCD screening (Grade 1A). Provided there is no concomitant severe cerebral vasculopathy or prior history of TIA, hydroxycarbamide may be offered to such children after at least 1 year of transfusions (Grade 1A) but the exact duration of transfusions should be tailored to the individual patient.
Long-term transfusion should be offered to children and adults who have suffered a previous ischaemic stroke due to sickle cell disease (Grade 1B).
Recurrent ACS
Acute chest syndrome is a marker of SCD severity, being a risk factor for early death in SS patients >20 years (Castro et al, 1994; Platt et al, 1994) and 44% of patients will have recurrent episodes (Castro et al, 1994). Evidence suggests that chronic transfusion therapy is effective in reducing incidence and hospitalisation due to ACS (Styles & Vichinsky, 1994; Miller et al, 2001; Hankins et al, 2005b). In the SIT trial, ACS was signiﬁcantly reduced in comparison with untransfused patients with an incidence rate ratio of 0Á13 (DeBaun et al, 2014). However, given that there is a clear beneﬁt of hydroxycarbamide for ACS prevention (Charache et al, 1995; Thornburg et al, 2012), transfusion should be considered only if hydroxycarbamide is ineffective or contraindicated.
Recommendation
Hydroxycarbamide is recommended as ﬁrst line treatment for recurrent acute chest syndrome or repeated painful episodes. Regular transfusion should be considered for patients failing this treatment or for whom it is contraindicated (Grade 1B).
Frequent painful crises
The frequency of sickle cell painful crises is a marker of disease severity; SS patients who are admitted to hospital ≥3 times a year because of vaso-occlusive crises are at increased risk of early death (Platt et al, 1991). Prolonged hospitalisations and high readmission rates are also associated with a higher mortality (Houston-Yu et al, 2003; Ballas & Lusardi, 2005).
Long-term transfusion may be of beneﬁt in patients with recurrent painful crises. In a retrospective study, long-term blood transfusion signiﬁcantly reduced the hospital admission frequency for vaso-occlusive crises from 2Á20 to 0Á21 per patient per year (Styles & Vichinsky, 1994). In the STOP trial, the hospital admission rate for vaso-occlusive crises in chronically transfused patients was signiﬁcantly less than for patients on standard care (9Á7 vs. 27Á1 events per 100 patient years) (Miller et al, 2001). In the SIT trial, incidence rates of painful crises were signiﬁcantly reduced by transfusion with an incidence rate ratio of 0Á41 (DeBaun et al, 2014).
200

However, hydroxycarbamide is very effective in reducing the rate of painful crises and ACS in both adults and children (Charache et al, 1995; Scott et al, 1996; Olivieri & Vichinsky, 1998) and improves survival (Steinberg et al, 2003, 2010). Therefore, hydroxycarbamide is the ﬁrst line therapy for patients with frequent vaso-occlusive crises with transfusion being reserved for those who do not respond or in whom hydroxycarbamide is contraindicated.
Recommendation
Transfusion, either by simple or exchange transfusion, should be considered in patients with frequent painful episodes where hydroxycarbamide is ineffective or contraindicated (Grade 1B).
Other possible indications
Transfusion has been used in a variety of sickle cell related problems, where clinical experience or case reports/series have suggested beneﬁt. In patients with renal disease, transfusion may be considered in end stage renal disease, in those awaiting a renal transplant and post-renal transplant (Sharpe & Thein, 2014). Transfusion has also been used in patients undergoing liver transplantation in the peri-transplant setting (Blinder et al, 2013; Gardner et al, 2014). Blood transfusion in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension seems theoretically reasonable, with the aim of decreasing haemolysis and thereby nitric oxide scavenging and consequent pulmonary vasoconstriction, and has been recommended for this purpose (Machado & Gladwin, 2005; Cho & Hambleton, 2011).
The incidence of priapism and symptomatic avascular necrosis was signiﬁcantly decreased by transfusion in the randomised SIT trial with incidence rate ratios of 0Á13 and 0Á22, respectively (DeBaun et al, 2014), but its beneﬁt in the management of patients with established disease has not been proven in randomised trials.
Transfusion has been used for other conditions including leg ulcers (Minniti et al, 2010; Delaney et al, 2013) and progressive sickle retinopathy (Gustave et al, 2013; McKinney et al, 2015). In some cases the reported beneﬁt from transfusion has seemed dramatic, but speciﬁc recommendations must await more extensive data.
Recommendation
Transfusion for indications where evidence is limited should be based on a case-by-case assessment after full risk-beneﬁt analysis (Grade 2C).
Preoperative transfusion
Anaesthesia and surgery increase sickle-related complications, particularly ACS, while transfusion reduces the risk of perioperative complications (Vichinsky et al, 1995; Howard et al,
ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd British Journal of Haematology, 2017, 176, 192–209

2013). Meticulous attention should be paid to optimising all aspects of perioperative care including oxygenation, hydration and warmth, as well as anaesthetic and surgical technique. Close liaison between anaesthetist, surgeon and haematologist is essential to ensuring good outcomes. Complicated surgical procedures should be undertaken in centres where there is specialist haemoglobinopathy support.
With regards to transfusion, the two key questions to consider are:
1 Should SCD patients be transfused routinely preoperatively?
2 If transfused, what is the optimal regimen?
Role of routine preoperative transfusion
This has long been controversial with insufﬁcient randomised trial data impacting on variability in practice across hospitals in England (Buck et al, 2005) and in other studies (Table II). There have been advocates both of routine pre-operative transfusion (Janik & Seeler, 1980; Fullerton et al, 1981; Derkay et al, 1991; Bhattacharyya et al, 1993) and selective transfusion (Oduro & Searle, 1972; Homi et al, 1979; Bischoff et al, 1988; Grifﬁn & Buchanan, 1993; Fu et al, 2005; Leff et al, 2007). A large observational study showed that perioperative transfusion was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower rate of SCD-related postoperative complications for SS patients undergoing low-risk procedures and for SC patients at all surgical risk levels (Koshy et al, 1995). However, these ﬁndings suggested that not all patients should routinely be transfused preoperatively. Another study showed that those receiving “no transfusion” suffered the highest overall SCDrelated complication rate (32%), chest syndrome rate (19%) and mortality rate (5%) but without signiﬁcant difference between those randomised to aggressive or simple transfusion regimens (Haberkern et al, 1997).
The most compelling evidence to support preoperative transfusion comes from the Transfusion Alternatives Preoperatively in Sickle Cell Disease (TAPS) trial (Howard et al, 2013). This was a randomised controlled trial in which a total of 67 SS and Sbo thalassaemia patients undergoing low risk surgery (e.g. adenoidectomy, dental procedures) and medium risk surgery (e.g. joint replacement, cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy) were randomly assigned to either no transfusion or transfusion (simple transfusion if Hb <90 g/l, exchange transfusion if Hb ≥90 g/l to achieve estimated HbS <60%) (Howard et al, 2013). Classiﬁcation of surgical risk was in accordance with the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease criteria (Koshy et al, 1995). Signiﬁcantly greater clinically important complications (39% vs. 15%) and serious adverse events (30% vs. 3%) were found in untransfused SS and S/bothalassaemia compared to transfused patients undergoing low-risk and medium-risk surgery. The most common serious adverse event was ACS, accounting for 91% of all serious events occurring in 27% of untransfused patients compared
ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd British Journal of Haematology, 2017, 176, 192–209

Guideline
with 3% in transfused patients. Intraoperative or postoperative transfusion was increased in the patients who had not been transfused preoperatively (Howard et al, 2013).
Although the ﬁnal number of subjects recruited into the trial at its termination was small, the TAPS study provided good evidence to support preoperative transfusion in SS patients undergoing low- and medium-risk surgical procedures.
Optimal preoperative transfusion regimen
In a study of SS and S/bo-thalassaemia patients (Vichinsky et al, 1995), a top-up transfusion regimen to haemoglobin 100 g/l was reported to be as effective as exchange transfusion to attain haemoglobin 100 g/l and HbS <30% in preventing perioperative complications and was associated with a 50% lower risk of transfusion-related complications. However, it must be noted that the type of exchange transfusion procedure was not described and some of the exchange transfused patients required repeated simple transfusion. Furthermore, in 14% of patients in the exchange transfusion arm, post-transfusion %HbS was substantially higher than the 30% target for a number of reasons including inadequate transfusion. Moreover, in the simple transfusion group, nearly 43% of the patients received “minimal transfusion therapy”. Despite these limitations, the authors concluded that simple transfusion was as effective as exchange transfusion.
The issue of whether simple or aggressive transfusion had better outcomes was not addressed in the TAPS trial, where the transfusion regimen was either simple transfusion if Hb <90 g/l or partial exchange transfusion if Hb ≥90 g/l, to a target Hb of 100 g/l and estimated HbS <60% (Howard et al, 2013). Seventy-six per cent of transfused patients received simple transfusion, providing support for the efﬁcacy of a conservative transfusion regimen in reducing post-operative complications for the relevant surgical procedures reported in the trial.
It is not possible to give dogmatic guidelines regarding the choice of type of preoperative transfusion and transfusion targets; these should be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account factors such as the type of surgery, the severity of the patient’s SCD and co-morbidities (see section Deciding which patients may beneﬁt from preoperative transfusion, Role of transfusion in surgery for sickle genotypes other than SS). However, it is reasonable to undertake simple transfusion for low and moderate risk surgery if Hb is <90 g/l to achieve a post-transfusion Hb of 100 g/l. An exchange transfusion should be considered for patients undergoing high-risk surgery, patients with severe SCD and those with signiﬁcant co-morbidities.
Emergency surgery
Evidence for the role of transfusion in emergency surgery is very limited. In the largest study on surgery in SCD, 717

Guideline
patients underwent 1079 surgical procedures of which 271 (25%) were emergency procedures (Koshy et al, 1995). When all procedures (elective + emergency) were considered, most patients undergoing cholecystectomy and splenectomy were transfused preoperatively (94% of SS and 82% of SC) as were those undergoing Caesarean section or hysterectomy (91% of SS and 72% of SC). As the data for postoperative outcomes were analysed together for elective and emergency procedures (rather than separately), it is not possible to assess the effect on transfusion on outcomes for SCD patients undergoing emergency surgery in this study.
Similarly, in another observational study, no separate analyses were carried for patients undergoing emergency surgery (Bischoff et al, 1988). In a further retrospective study where perioperative transfusion was used selectively and sparingly (Homi et al, 1979), 5 postoperative deaths occurred in 28 patients undergoing emergency surgery; however, it is not clear if these patients were transfused preoperatively.
The important principle here is to not unnecessarily delay emergency surgery because of transfusion. A reasonable policy is to give a simple transfusion to patients who have Hb <90 g/l and then proceed to surgery with minimal delay. If the Hb is >90 g/l and the surgical procedure is low risk, it is reasonable to proceed to surgery without delay while arrangements are made to transfuse the patient intra- operatively or post-operatively if necessary.
Role of transfusion in surgery for sickle genotypes other than SS
There is a paucity of evidence relating speciﬁcally to SC and other sickle genotypes. One observational study suggested a beneﬁt for transfusion in reducing the incidence of sickle cell-related postoperative complications for SC patients at all levels of surgical risk (Koshy et al, 1995), however, transfused SC patients undergoing low-risk surgery had higher rates of non-sickle cell postoperative complications (fever and bleeding) than untransfused patients. A further study demonstrated that preoperative transfusion was beneﬁcial for moderate risk procedures, particularly abdominal surgery (Neumayr et al, 1998).
Deciding which patients may beneﬁt from preoperative transfusion
The TAPS trial has provided evidence for the efﬁcacy of preoperative transfusion only for SS patients with preoperative Hb 60–90 g/l undergoing a narrow range of elective medium-risk surgical procedures (Howard et al, 2013). The trial’s ﬁndings may not be applicable to many other surgical situations. However, on the basis of the ﬁndings, it is recommended that preoperative transfusion to an Hb of 100 g/l be considered a standard intervention in SS undergoing elective low-risk or medium-risk surgery as deﬁned in the study (Howard et al, 2013). For other patients it is recommended
203

Guideline
that each case is judged on its own merits in consultation with the SHT. Transfusion should be considered when the risk of post-operative chest infection or ACS is high, but this has yet to be clearly shown in prospective trials. Transfusion is also recommended for individuals with signiﬁcant co-morbidities (e.g. abnormal pulmonary, cardiac, renal and hepatic function) and in those undergoing high-risk surgical procedures or having lengthy surgical procedures (Wun & Hassell, 2009).
The optimal method of transfusion remains an open question but currently available evidence indicates that simple transfusion is not inferior to exchange transfusion in low- to medium-risk surgery (Vichinsky et al, 1995; Howard et al, 2013), However exchange transfusion is recommended for patients undergoing high-risk surgery, although this has not been directly addressed in studies.
Recommendation
Preoperative transfusion (simple transfusion to Hb 100 g/l if Hb <90 g/l or partial exchange if Hb ≥90 g/l) is recommended for SS patients undergoing low and medium-risk surgery (Grade 1A).
Exchange transfusion is recommended for all patients with SS requiring high-risk surgery (Grade 1C).
Preoperative transfusion is recommended for patients with SC undergoing moderate risk surgery and high-risk surgery (Grade 1C).
All other patients undergoing surgery should be individually assessed, taking into account previous history and complexity of surgery, and a management plan should be formulated to include the need for transfusion (Grade 1C).
For patients requiring emergency surgery, the urgency and complexity of the procedure should be taken into account in the timing of perioperative transfusion. Provided transfusion will not result in undue delay to surgery, simple transfusion should be given preoperatively to a target Hb of 100 g/l if the Hb is low. If Hb ≥90 g/l and surgical risk is low but transfusion will result in an unacceptable delay to surgery, it is reasonable to proceed to surgery without delay while arrangements are made to transfuse the patient intra- operatively or post-operatively if necessary (Grade 1C).
Transfusion in pregnancy
Sickle cell disease in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of both maternal and fetal complications (Smith et al, 1996; Serjeant et al, 2004; Villers et al, 2008; Oteng-Ntim et al, 2015a,b). Maternal complications include sickle-related problems (notably painful crises, ACS) and pregnancy-related syndromes, such as pre-eclampsia, preterm labour and an increased rate of Caesarean section (Villers et al, 2008; Oteng-Ntim et al, 2015b). Fetal complications include intra-uterine growth restriction, prematurity
204

and increased rates of fetal loss (Serjeant et al, 2004; OtengNtim et al, 2015b). In a UK-wide observational study of 109 pregnancies in SCD, 52% of women suffered painful crises during pregnancy and 13% within 6 weeks post-partum; 6% had ACS and 21% were admitted to intensive care (OtengNtim et al, 2015a).
There is a single prospective randomised controlled study that compared 36 pregnant SS women who were transfused prophylactically (simple or partial exchange transfusion commencing in the ﬁrst or second trimester; target Hb 100– 110 g/l; target HbS <35%) to a control group of 36 SS women who received transfusion only for medical or obstetric emergencies (Koshy et al, 1988). This study found a signiﬁcant reduction in the incidence of painful crises and substantial decrease in other SCD-related complications in the group receiving prophylactic transfusions but no difference in medical and obstetric complications or fetal outcome between the two groups. Additionally, satisfactory pregnancy outcomes were observed in a non-randomised group of SS, SC and S/b thalassaemia women who were transfused only for medical or obstetric emergencies. In view of these results, the authors concluded that omitting prophylactic transfusions was not harmful to pregnant patients with SCD or their offspring and thus routine use of transfusions in pregnancy was not justiﬁed. However, this study had a number of signiﬁcant limitations including small sample size and high risk of bias (Malinowski et al, 2015).
Other uncontrolled studies have shown conﬂicting evidence, with some showing evidence for a beneﬁt of transfusion (Cunningham et al, 1983; Morrison et al, 1991; Howard et al, 1995; Gilli et al, 2007; Asma et al, 2015; Benites et al, 2016) whilst others did not (Tuck et al, 1987; El-Shafei et al, 1995). The study by Howard et al (1995) demonstrated a trend for reduced SCD-related complications in the third trimester in patients on prophylactic exchange transfusions, leading the authors to recommend prophylactic transfusions from the 26th week of pregnancy onwards in SS patients. In a more recent retrospective study, high rates of painful sickle crises and other severe sickle complications occurred despite a policy of prophylactic partial exchange transfusions to maintain HbS <40% from 22 to 26 weeks onwards for all sickle patients (Ngo et al, 2010), but there was no control arm not receiving prophylactic transfusion for comparison.
A Cochrane review which examined evidence from two small studies of low quality concluded that other than a marginal reduction in the rate of painful crises, prophylactic transfusion conferred no clear advantage over selective transfusion with regards to pregnancy outcome (Okusanya & Oladapo, 2013). However, the ﬁndings of a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 11 cohort studies and the randomised controlled trial reported by Koshy et al (1988), suggested that prophylactic transfusion is associated with a reduction in vaso-occlusive episodes, maternal mortality, overall pulmonary complications, neonatal mortality and pre-term birth while acknowledging the
ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd British Journal of Haematology, 2017, 176, 192–209

methodological limitations of the original study designs (Malinowski et al, 2015).
As a result of the limited and sometimes conﬂicting data, the use of prophylactic transfusion varies between centres. There is a consensus however that pregnant women with a history of severe SCD-related complications, such as recurrent ACS and stroke, individuals on chronic transfusion prior to pregnancy, and those with repeated sickle cell crises or exacerbation of anaemia during pregnancy, should receive transfusion (Koshy, 1995; Sickle Cell Society 2008; RCOG, 2011). Prophylactic transfusion should also be considered for women with other serious medical or obstetric conditions or with a multiple pregnancy. (Koshy, 1995; ACOG, 2007; RCOG 2011).
It should be emphasised that pregnancy in women with SCD is high-risk and expert obstetric care is essential to achieving good outcomes. The ideal standard of care is joint management by obstetricians and haematologists who are experienced in the care of SCD patients.
Recommendations
Prophylactic transfusion is not routinely required for sickle pregnancy, but should be considered for women with: • previous or current medical, obstetric or fetal problems,
related to SCD • women previously on hydroxycarbamide because of sev-
ere disease

Guideline
• multiple pregnancy (Grade 1C).
Women on long-term transfusions for stroke prevention or for amelioration of severe sickle complications should continue with regular transfusions throughout pregnancy. (Grade 1B).
Transfusion should be considered in women with worsening anaemia or those with acute SCD complications (acute chest syndrome, stroke etc.) (Grade 1B).
