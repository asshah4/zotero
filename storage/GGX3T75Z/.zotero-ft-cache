Abstract 
The behavioral, neurochemical and histological changes of rats subjected to 3 days treatment with intracerebroventricular infusion of beta-amyloid peptides(Aβ) (1–42) were investigated 20 days and 80 days after the surgery. Aβ (1–42) produced a dose-dependent and a time-dependent impairment in the spontaneous alternation performance in the Y-maze (spatial working memory), place navigation task in a water maze (spatial reference memory) and passive avoidance retention (non-spatial long-term memory) at doses of 10 and 20 μg/rat. The learning impairments were more severe at 80 days than 20 days after infusion of Aβ (1–42) . At 25 days after the infusion, a significant decrease in hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) binding was observed only in the hippocampus, although choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was unchanged in the brain regions tested as compared with the vehicle (Aβ 40–1 ) treatment. In contrast, the reduction in ChAT activity 85 days after Aβ (1–42) infusion was significant in hippocampus and striatum. HC-3 binding was also significantly decreased in the posterior cortex, hippocampus and striatum. In the histological analysis, brain atrophy was observed inasmuch as ventricular enlargement and neuronal damage in the CA1 area of the hippocampus were seen 85 days after Aβ (1–42) infusion. These results suggest that the rats subjected to intracerebroventricular infusion of Aβ (1–42) suffered from progressive brain dysfunction, and could be useful as an animal model for evaluating the developmental processes at the early and/or middle stage of Alzheimer’s-type dementia.

Abstract 
Lesions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons projecting to cerebral cortex and hippocampus have recently been exploited as animal models for some of the neurochemical and behavioral deficits of Alzheimer's disease. We have observed that electrolytic lesions of cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei can lead to morphological plasticity in adult mouse cortex. In the present study, the acute and chronic sequelae of basal forebrain electrolytic lesion on cortical synaptic chemistry have been examined. In addition to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, levels of norepinephrine and of serotonin were reduced within a week after the lesion. Recovery of ChAT activity and of serotonin levels began within a month after the lesion. Serotonin type 2 receptor binding exhibited an acute reduction after the lesion in ipsilateral cortex, followed later by a chronic bilateral decrease. No significant changes in beta-adrenergic receptors were apparent at any time after the lesion despite a permanent and bilateral reduction of norepinephrine levels after the lesion. The potential significance of these results for cortical plasticity regulation and Alzheimer's disease is discussed.

Abstract 
The ability to manipulate the mammalian genome through transgenic techniques is a powerful tool for behavioral neuroscientists. However, the interpretation of the behavioral consequences of such manipulations is not uncomplicated. Here demonstrate both the utility and the pitfalls inherent in these techniques through a discussion of recent advances in the elucidation of senile dementia. We show that the interpretation of the results from such studies requires the application of multiple behavioral paradigms, the data from which must be viewed holistically in order to interpret the effects of the transgenic manipulation. We also highlight the difficulties inherent in manipulating single genes and show that in order to comprehensively model complex brain-related phenomena (e.g., senile dementia), multiple (typically interactive) genetic changes are often required.

Abstract 
Genes and environment interact to influence behavior. Animal models that examine the effects of natural genetic variation, the effects of mutations, and the effects of targeted genetic engineering on behavior have been instrumental in understanding the influence of genes on behavior and the influence of behavior on gene expression. Multiple animal models that include Drosophila (fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans ( C . elegans , nematode), and mice ( Mus musculus ) have been instrumental in the study of behavioral genetics because of the high degree of homology across species.

Abstract 
Our understanding of human amnesia has been greatly advanced through the use of animal models. Although animals and humans differ greatly in many ways, the basic principles of brain organization and function are homologous. The use of selective methods of lesion production has enabled neuroscientists to examine in rats and monkeys the contribution of specific structures implicated in human memory in a way that is rarely possible in human studies. This chapter describes several categories of animal model that have advanced our understanding of the processes underlying normal human memory and, in particular, the deficits observed in human amnesia.
