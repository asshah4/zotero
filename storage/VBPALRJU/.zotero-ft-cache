The Limited Reliability of Physical Signs for Estimating Hemodynamics
in Chronic Heart Failure
Lynne Warner Stevenson, MD, Joseph K. Perloff, MD

The cardiovascular physical examination is used commonly as a basis for diagnosis and therapy in chronic heart failure, although the relationship between physical signs, increased ventricular filling pressure, and decreased cardiac output has not been established for this population. We prospectively compared physical signs with hemodynamic measurements in 50 patients with known chronic heart failure (ejection fraction, .18\m=+-\.06).Rales, edema, and elevated mean jugular venous pressure were absent in 18 of 43 patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg, for which the combination of these signs had 58% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Proportional pulse pressure correlated well with cardiac index (r=.82), and when less than 25% pulse pressure had 91% sensitivity and 83% specificity for a cardiac index less than 2.2 L/min/m2. In chronic heart failure, reliance on physical signs for elevated ventricular filling pressure might result in inadequate therapy. Conversely, the adequacy of cardiac output is assessed reliably by pulse pressure. Our results facilitate decisions regarding treatment in chronic heart
failure.

physical signs of congestive heart failure include a third heart sound, pul¬ monary rales, an abnormal jugular ve¬ nous pulse (height and wave form), and peripheral edema.12 These criteria, together with the history and chest roentgenogram, have been useful in identifying patients with ejection frac¬
tions of less than 40% to 50%.3"8 Patients

has been established require constant vigilance to identify hemodynamic dete¬ rioration that necessitates adjustment of therapy. While the relationship be¬ tween physical signs and hemodynamic profile has a firm basis for acute conges¬ tive heart failure,9 the chronic state is characterized by a host of compensatory mechanisms that may cause disparities, such as the absence of rales and periph¬ eral edema despite symptomatic eleva¬ tion of ventricular filling pressures. Be¬ cause the accuracy of physical signs for the identification of elevated filling pressure and depressed cardiac output has not been established in patients with chronically depressed left ventric-

ular systolic function, we undertook a prospective study to correlate physical signs with hemodynamic data in 50 con¬ secutive patients so diagnosed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

All 50 patients had secure diagnoses

of heart failure at the time of elective

hemodynamic measurements, which

were performed as part of an evaluation

for cardiac transplantation (39 patients)

or an assessment of the adequacy of

medical regimens (11 patients). Thirty-

seven patients were men, aged 47 ± 15

years; 13 were women, aged 39 ±13

years. Only patients with heart failure

accompanied by ventricular dilation and

ejection fractions ofless than or equal to

.30 (systolic dysfunction) were included

to eliminate those with circulatory con¬

gestion arising from primary restriction

of diastolic filling. Mean ejection frac¬

tion

was

function resulted from nonischemic di¬

lated cardiomyopathy in 36 patients and

from ischémie heart disease in 14 pa¬

tients. The duration of congestive

symptoms ranged from three to 100

months (median, 19 months). Medica¬

tions being taken at the time of study

included digoxin by 42 patients, furose-

mide by 42 patients, vasodilators by 28

patients, and milrinone by two patients.

Physical examinations were per¬

ately before right-sided heart catheter¬

stethoscope applied to the right or left
brachial artery. Care was taken to pre¬
vent prolonged cuff inflation to avoid venous congestion and a spurious de¬ crease in pulse pressure.2,3 The diastolic
pressure was taken as the level at which
Korotkoff's sounds disappeared. The proportional pulse pressure was defined
as follows:
systolic pressure diastolic pressure
-
systolic pressure
Pulmonary rales were graded from 0
to 4. A score of 1 indicates rales over one
quarter ofthe posterior lung fields and 4 indicates rales over the entire posterior lung fields. Central venous pressure
was assessed from the internal and ex¬
ternal jugular veins with the patient at
30° to 45°. Central venous pressure ele¬
vation was graded as 0 if the crests of
neither the internal nor the external
jugular veins were visible above the clavicle in this position and as 4 if the
crests were visible at the earlobe in this
position and in the full upright position. Peripheral edema was graded as 0 to 4 according to the depth of indentation at
the ankle. Third heart sounds were
sought by identifying the left ventricu¬ lar impulse in the left lateral decubitus position and applying the bell of the stethoscope just lightly enough for a skin seal.2 Orthopnea (during the previ¬ ous week) was graded as 0 to 4, with 0 indicating no need for more than one pillow on a flat bed and 4 indicating at least one night spent sleeping in a sit¬ ting position.
Radiographic information may con¬ tribute to the diagnosis of low ejection fraction and heart failure,3"8 but chest roentgenograms were not included be¬ cause this study was designed to deter¬ mine the reliability of physical signs for assessment of hemodynamic status without recourse to other diagnostic procedures.
A #7 F balloon-tipped thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter was inserted percutaneously into the right internal jugular vein or the right antecubital vein, the latter when a sufficiently su¬ pine position was not tolerated. The po¬ sition of the catheter tip was confirmed by fluoroscopy, and pressures were measured in the right atrium, pulmo¬ nary trunk, and pulmonary capillary wedge positions. The right atrial and wedge pressures were recorded on strip charts in the respiratory midposition.
Thermodilution cardiac outputs were determined in triplicate with iced injectate.
Tb establish the maximum sensitivity of the physical signs, all scores greater than zero were considered positive. Pul¬ monary capillary wedge pressure great-

er than 20 mm Hg and cardiac index less
than 2.2 L/min/m2 were chosen as con¬
servative estimates of hemodynamic abnormalities warranting therapy. Be¬ cause no patient had a pulmonary capil¬ lary wedge pressure in the range of 19 to 21 mm Hg, the categories were divided into greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg and less than or equal to 18 mm Hg. The correlations between hemodynamics
and clinical measurements were as¬
sessed with linear regression and in 2x2 tables, for which significance was determined by two-tailed Fisher's exact
test.
RESULTS
The age, etiology of left ventricular failure, and physical signs for the 50 patients are shown in Table 1. Rales were present in eight patients, eleva¬ tions in mean jugular venous pressures were present in 25 patients, and periph¬ eral edema was present in ten patients; third heart sounds were present in 48 patients.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pres¬
sures ranged from 8 to 44 mm Hg (Table
2) and were greater than or equal to 35 mm Hg in 18 (36%) of 50 patients, great¬ er than or equal to 25 mm Hg in 38 patients (76%), and greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg in 43 patients (86%). The remaining seven wedge pressures were 8 to 18 mm Hg. The eight patients with rales all had pulmonary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg. The presence of rales, howev¬ er, identified only 19% of patients with pulmonary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg and 11% of patients with pulmonary wedge pres¬ sures greater than or equal to 35 mm Hg. Third heart sounds were present in all but two patients (wedge pressures, 8 and 26 mm Hg) and therefore were not specific for identifying high filling pres¬ sures in our study group.
Right atrial pressures were greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg in 28 pa¬ tients, all of whom had pulmonary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg. Elevated right-sided fill¬ ing pressures could be diagnosed from either the jugular venous pressure or
from edema or from both in 21 (75%) of
28 patients with right atrial pressures greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. All ten patients with edema also had abnor¬ mally high jugular venous pressures.
Because elevated left ventricular fill¬
ing pressures were less evident clini¬ cally than the frequently coexisting ele¬ vations of right ventricular filling pressures, the reliability of the physical examination for detection of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg was assessed by

using jugular venous pressure and ede¬ ma as criteria in addition to pulmonary rales (Table 3). Elevated jugular venous
pressure was the most sensitive criteri¬
on and was present in every patient who had other physical signs of congestion. However, even using all these criteria,
elevated filling pressures could not be diagnosed in 18 (42%) of43 patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg. Physical evidence specific for conges¬ tion was absent in eight (44%) of 18 pa¬ tients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 35 mmHg.
To assess tolerance for the supine position during catheterization, all patients were questioned regarding orthopnea. Orthopnea within the pre¬ ceding week was reported by 39 (91%) of 43 patients with pulmonary wedge pres¬ sures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg. Recent orthopnea was absent in four patients with pulmonary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg and in all seven patients with
lower pressures.

There was poor corre¬ lation, however, between cardiac index or stroke volume index and systolic pressure (r= .36 and r = .45, respective¬ ly) or mean arterial pressure (r = .05 and r=.08, respectively). A proportional pulse pressure less than or equal to 25% identified 29 (91%) of 32 patients with
cardiac indexes less than 2.2 L/min/m2
(Table 4). The proportional pulse pres¬ sure was greater than 25% in 15 (83%) of 18 patients with cardiac indexes greater
than 2.2 L/min/m2. If a cardiac index of
less than or equal to 2.0 L/min/m2 was selected, the results were 93% and 80%. The use of proportional pulse pressure yielded an 88% predictive accuracy for
low cardiac output. Linear regression showed no correla¬
tion between the amount of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure elevation and
the amount of cardiac index reduction
(r=.22, not significant). However, the seven patients with pulmonary capil¬ lary wedge pressures less than or equal to 18 mm Hg all had cardiac indexes
greater than 2.2 L/min/m2 (Table 5), as did 11 (26%) of 43 patients with high pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. Right atrial pressure correlated with cardiac index (r=.53, P<.01), and 25 (89%) of 28 patients with right atrial
pressures greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg had cardiac indexes less than 2.2 L/min/m2, as did seven (32%) of 22 pa¬ tients with right atrial pressures less thanl0mmHg(P<.001).

quently exceeded 22 to 25 mm Hg de¬ spite the absence of specific evidence in the physical signs. However, cardiac in¬ dexes less than or equal to 2.2 L/min/m2 were predicted reliably by the propor¬ tional pulse pressure measured at the
bedside.
While other studies have reported the value of clinical information in diag¬ nosing left ventricular dysfunction,3"8 the purpose of this study was not to distinguish normal from abnormal ven¬ tricular function but to assess hemody¬ namic status among patients known to have low left ventricular ejection frac¬ tions. The primary hemodynamic ab¬ normalities caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction are elevation of left ventricular filling pressures and de¬ pression of cardiac output, which do not necessarily occur together. The reliabil¬ ity of the physical signs for identifying
marked to severe elevations of ventric¬
ular filling pressure and reductions in cardiac output has not been established previously in this population, for whom inferences drawn from physical signs are important for optimal therapy with vasodilators and diuretics, especially in the outpatient setting.
A sudden elevation of pulmonary ve¬
nous pressure causes rales due to ex¬
travasation of fluid into the alveoli,10 but
chronic exudation of fluid is associated
with an increase in lymphatic drainage so that the alveoli remain relatively dry and rales are absent. In our patients in

whom symptomatic heart failure had been present for at least three months, pulmonary rales were rarely present, even when the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were greater than or equal to 35 mm Hg. However, accumu¬ lation of fluid in the alveolar-capillary interstitium leads to decreased lung compliance and dyspnea,11 which also can result from an increase in physiolog¬ ical dead space due to ventilation-perfu¬
sion mismatching.12 Clinical recognition

ma is difficult13 and should not depend on
the presence of rales. Third heart sounds have been consid¬
ered reliable signs of heart failure and
elevated ventricular filling pressure2"8 and are helpful for the initial diagnosis
of ventricular failure. Nevertheless, in our patients already known to have se¬ verely reduced ejection fractions, third
heart sounds were too common to be
specific for identifying major elevations of left ventricular filling pressure.
Physical signs of high right ventricu¬ lar filling pressure usually were evident when the right atrial mean pressure was greater than 10 mm Hg. Variations in loading conditions of the right ventricle are reliably transmitted directly into the systemic venous system, which can be assessed visually in the jugular pulse.2 Elevated right atrial pressure, in this setting of left ventricular failure, was always accompanied by elevated left ventricular filling pressure, al¬ though the converse was not true in this and previous studies.914 Elevated jugu¬ lar venous pressure and peripheral ede¬ ma, therefore, were specific but not sen¬ sitive for high left ventricular filling pressure. The correlation between high right ventricular filling pressure and
low cardiac output may reflect the effect
of poor left ventricular function on right ventricular performance, impairment of left ventricular filling by right ventricu¬ lar distention, or the importance ofright
ventricular function as a determinant of
cardiac output, at least during physical
exercise.1616
Exertional dyspnea may result more from inadequate tissue oxygen delivery than from pulmonary venous conges¬ tion,17 but orthopnea results from posi¬ tional volume changes that increase left ventricular filling pressure and extravascular pulmonary fluid.18 In our study, a history of recent orthopnea was
the most reliable clinical indicator of
high left ventricular filling pressure.
Cuff blood pressure has been used in
the diagnosis of a low ejection fraction4 but previously has not been evaluated specifically for assessment of cardiac output in patients with chronically low ejection fractions. In our patients, nei¬ ther the systolic blood pressure nor the mean arterial pressure alone predicted cardiac index or stroke volume index, which were predicted by the propor¬ tional pulse pressure. The pulse pres¬ sure reflects the complex interplay be¬ tween stroke volume, heart rate, aortic distensibility, and peripheral vascular
tone and their relative contributions to incident and reflected waves.19"21 While
measurement of cardiac output from
pulse pressure was first suggested in 1904,22 even the introduction of multiple

adjustment factors did not allow precise quantitation of cardiac output from pulse pressures for a varied popula-
tion.28"25
In this study of simple physical as¬ sessment of hemodynamic status, pulse pressure was used primarily to identify the presence of severely reduced cardi¬
ac index rather than to estimate an ex¬
act value. As many patients with severe
heart failure achieve their best cardiac
outputs at systolic blood pressures be¬
low 100 mm Hg,26 pulse pressure as a
proportion oftotal systolic pressure was analyzed. A proportional pulse pressure less than or equal to 25% identified 91% of patients with cardiac indexes less than or equal to 2.2 L/min/m2, while a higher pulse pressure identified 83% of patients with higher cardiac indexes. For comparison, proportional pulse
pressures derived from blood pressure
recordings in 42 patients with noncardiac disease (without hypertension)
and Fick cardiac outputs of 6.3 ±0.4
L/min/m2 were 39% ± 8%, with only one value less than or equal to 25% in an early study on cardiac output measure¬ ment.25 It should be emphasized that the current study validates proportional pulse pressure only for patients with
known chronic dilated left ventricular
failure (ejection fraction, .18±.06) and may not be applicable to patients with other cardiac diseases, including hypertension.
The role of the physical examination in the management of chronic heart fail¬ ure is coupled closely to the hemody¬ namic goals of therapy. Pulmonary cap¬ illary wedge pressure usually can be lowered to near-normal levels by di¬ uretic and vasodilator therapy in the chronically dilated ventricle without compromising cardiac output.26 Such therapy not only improves symptoms of congestion but also reduces the left ven¬ tricular dilation and mitral régurgita¬
tion that increase ventricular work and
further contribute to decompensation.27
A cardiac index of 2.0 to 2.2 L/min/m2 represents a reasonable estimate of the
minimum necessary for adequate organ perfusion with normal hemoglobin level and resting oxygen consumption.28 The efficacy of many vasodilator agents for increasing lower cardiac outputs has been shown.29,30 Pulmonary wedge pres¬ sure less than 18 mm Hg and cardiac index greater than 2.2 L/min/m2, there¬ fore, represent conservative hemody¬ namic goals for this patient population.
The four hemodynamic profiles de¬ fined for acute myocardial infarction9 were adapted to our patients with chronic heart failure. Although high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure generally accompanies low cardiac in-

dex, the converse is not always true. There were seven patients with the first profile, cardiac index greater than 2.2 L/min/m2 and pulmonary wedge pres¬ sure less than or equal to 18 mm Hg, consistent with adequate therapy. Pul¬ monary capillary wedge pressure was high without low cardiac index in 11 patients (second profile). Unlike pa¬ tients with acute infarction,9 none ofour patients with chronic heart failure pre¬ sented with low filling pressure and low cardiac index (third profile). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was high with low cardiac index in 32 patients (fourth profile). Despite the use of digoxin, diuretics, and vasodilators in most pa¬ tients prior to evaluation, 43 (86%) of 50 patients referred thus had hemodynam¬ ic profiles with targets for further ther¬ apy with diuretics, vasodilators, or
both.
Physical evidence of pulmonary con¬ gestion (rales) was specific for profile 2 or 4, but rare. Detection of elevated mean jugular venous pressure was
more common, but still not very sensi¬
tive. Narrow proportional pulse pres¬ sure indicated profile 4 (or 3). When the hemodynamic profile and targets for therapy can be identified from the phys¬ ical examination, therapy often can be adjusted effectively in the outpatient setting, without invasive quantitation of left ventricular filling pressures or cardiac output. However, the frequen¬ cy of undetected high left ventricular filling pressures, with or without low cardiac index, indicates that patients with low ejection fractions who describe dyspnea and particularly orthopnea should not be doubted merely because specific physical signs of pulmonary and systemic venous congestion are absent. These patients may require invasive study to detect and treat severely ele¬ vated left ventricular filling pressures. In addition, patients in whom empiric therapy based on pulse pressure, ve¬ nous pressure, or orthopnea is limited by hypotension or declining renal func¬
tion may benefit from insertion of an
indwelling pulmonary arterial catheter to facilitate more precise design of
treatment. Initial administration of in¬ travenous diuretics and vasodilators
tailored to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance often allows the subsequent design of effective oral therapy in pa¬ tients previously considered clinically refractory.31
By prospective comparison of cardio¬ vascular physical signs with hemody¬ namic measurements in patients with chronic congestive heart failure from di¬ lated cardiomyopathy or end-stage cor¬ onary artery disease, our study has

of left ventricular filling pressure fre¬ quently are undetected, while the ade¬ quacy of resting cardiac output is as¬ sessed reliably by the proportional pulse pressure.
