Abstract 
Although monkeys can perceive complex stimuli such as faces, only the higher apes are capable of recognizing their own face in a mirror. Here we show that in humans the right hemisphere of the brain seems to be preferentially involved in self-face recognition. Our findings indicate that neural substrates of the right hemisphere may selectively participate in processes linked to self-awareness.
