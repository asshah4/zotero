Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability has often been used to assess cardiac autonomic function; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power of heart rate variability to cardiac sympathetic tone has been unclear. With or without adjustment for high-frequency (HF) power, total power or respiration, LF power seems to provide an index not of cardiac sympathetic tone but of baroreﬂex function. Manipulations and drugs that change LF power or LF:HF may do so not by affecting cardiac autonomic outﬂows directly but by affecting modulation of those outﬂows by baroreﬂexes.

Experimental Physiology

The autonomic nervous system plays major roles in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis and in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disease states. The system includes vagal cholinergic and sympathetic noradrenergic nerves that supply the heart and sympathetic noradrenergic nerves that enmesh arterioles, which are a major determinant of total peripheral resistance to blood ﬂow in the body and therefore of the blood pressure. Clinicians and researchers have long sought valid, non-invasive, quantitative means to identify pathophysiologically relevant abnormalities of these systems.
As will be emphasized later, one must distinguish autonomic ‘tone’ from modulation of that tone. If one considers a home heating system, there is a difference between measuring how much the furnace is working and measuring how much one can regulate the furnace by adjusting the thermostat. We will be proposing that power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) provides a means to evaluate the ability to modulate autonomic outﬂows via baroreﬂexes rather than a means to evaluate autonomic tone per se.

Low-frequency power is unrelated to cardiac
sympathetic tone during supine rest
About a century ago, the great Dutch cardiologist, Karel Frederik Wenckebach (the same Wenckebach for whom a type of second degree heart block still bears his name) wrote that a variable pulse rate is a sign of a healthy heart (Wenckebach, 1914). Since then, many studies have shown that both tachycardia and decreased HRV are adverse prognostic signs in a variety of common conditions, such as ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
Heart rate variability can be assessed in the time and frequency domains. Measures in the time domain include the standard deviation of heart rate and the standard deviation of heart rate normalized for absolute heart rate. It is generally accepted that under resting conditions HRV in the time domain mainly reﬂects respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which is mediated by parasympathetic cardiovagal outﬂow. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia corresponds to Wenckebach’s sign of a healthy heart. In heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke,

respiratory sinus arrhythmia usually is either blunted or absent. In the frequency domain, the most commonly used approach is based on power spectral analysis of HRV and in particular quantiﬁcation of low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power. The latter corresponds to the frequency of breathing, and most investigators agree that just as for HRV in the time domain, HF power in the frequency domain mainly reﬂects respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
The origins and clinical signiﬁcance of LF power have aroused intense interest and persistent controversy (Akselrod et al. 1981). The source and meaning of LF power are the main subject matter of this review. Many studies have presumed that LF power, especially if adjusted for HF power, total power or respiration, provides an index of cardiac sympathetic ‘tone’ and that the ratio of LF to HF power indicates ‘sympathovagal balance’. Thus, a PubMed search on low-frequency power of heart rate variability and cardiac sympathetic tone yielded 227 citations.
Several lines of evidence, however, argue against the validity of LF power, with or without adjustment for HF or total power, as an index of sympathetic outﬂow especially to the heart.
(1) The rate of entry of the sympathetic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline, into the cardiac venous drainage (cardiac noradrenaline spillover) provides a ‘gold standard’ index of cardiac sympathetic outﬂow. Individual values for LF power and LF:HF are not correlated with cardiac noradrenaline spillover (Kingwell et al. 1994; Alvarenga et al. 2006; Moak et al. 2007; Baumert et al. 2009).
(2) Cardiac sympathetic neuroimaging by 18Fﬂuorodopamine or 11C-hydroxyephedrine positron emission tomographic scanning or 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine single photon emission computed tomographic scanning enables quantitative assessment of noradrenergic innervation of the left ventricular myocardium. The imaging agents are taken up by sympathetic nerves and then translocated from the cytosol to intraneuronal vesicles. In other words, the scanning depicts the radioactivity in the vesicles in sympathetic nerves. As shown in Fig. 1, the log of LF power is not correlated with left ventricular myocardial concentrations of 18F-ﬂuorodopamine, nor is LF:HF (Moak et al. 2007). The LF to HF ratio is also unrelated to cardiac sympathetic innervation assessed by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning in patients with Parkinson’s disease (Haensch et al. 2009). Analogously, LF power is not associated with myocardial sympathetic innervation by 11C-hydroxyephedrine scanning (Vesalainen et al. 1999).

(3) Drugs that increase release of noradrenaline from cardiac sympathetic nerves (e.g. tyramine, yohimbine) increase LF power even in patients with neuroimaging evidence of cardiac sympathetic denervation (Moak et al. 2007).
(4) In patients with congestive heart failure, cardiac sympathetic outﬂow is known to be markedly increased (Eisenhofer et al. 1996), yet such patients have very low LF power (Adamopoulos et al. 1992; Creager, 1992; Guzzetti et al. 1995; Vesalainen et al. 1999). Low-frequency power in this setting and in the setting of pulmonary hypertension can even be negatively related to skeletal muscle sympathetic outﬂow (Notarius et al. 1999; McGowan et al. 2009).
(5) Blockade of preganglionic cardiac sympathetic outﬂow by segmental spinal anaesthesia does not affect LF power or LF:HF, although segmental spinal anaesthesia does attenuate the increase in LF:HF during head-up tilt (Hopf et al. 1995).
(6) With ageing, cardiac and total body noradrenaline spillover and skeletal muscle sympathetic outﬂow increase. That is, delivery of noradrenaline to its receptors increases with ageing. In contrast, LF power decreases, and LF:HF remains unchanged (Lipsitz et al. 1990; Ryan et al. 1992; Piccirillo et al. 1995; Karas et al. 2008).
(7) Bilateral thoracic sympathectomies or sympathotomies, which produce partial cardiac sympathetic denervation (Moak et al. 2005), do not decrease LF power or LF:HF (Noppen et al. 1996; Tedoriya et al. 1999). We recently conﬁrmed this ﬁnding in a cohort of patients with bilateral thoracic sympathectomies (Fig. 1). In the study of Noppen et al. (1996), sympathectomized patients had decreased LF power during orthostasis, but in the study of Tedoriya et al. (1999) they did not.
(8) Cardiac β-adrenergic stimulation with isoprenaline, which increases heart rate and plasma noradrenaline levels (Goldstein et al. 1986), decreases LF power (Ahmed et al. 1994).
(9) Considering that LF power is inﬂuenced by respiration-related changes in cardiovagal outﬂow, it has been suggested that accounting for respiratory inﬂuences on LF power improves the accuracy of power spectral analysis of HRV in assessment of cardiac sympathetic tone (Aysin et al. 2007; Colombo et al. 2008). The ANSAR ANX 3.0 system (ANSAR Medical Technologies Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA) is the only commercially available device that makes this adjustment. The ANX 3.0 uses a proprietary algorithm that yields a variable termed LFa. In conjunction with a testing protocol for beat-tobeat heart rate, respiration and blood pressure during baseline sitting, the Valsalva manoeuvre and standing, the ANX 3.0 calculates values for LFa and

interprets those values in terms of sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation and sympathovagal balance. Our recent ﬁndings that patients with low baroreﬂex-cardiovagal slopes have decreased

values for LFa compared with subjects who have normal baroreﬂex slopes and that these decreases are independent of cardiac sympathetic innervation cast doubt on the notion that even with respiratory

adjustment LF power provides a measure of cardiac sympathetic tone (Rahman et al. 2011). (10) Low-frequency power is unrelated to several measures of extracardiac sympathetic outﬂow, such as peroneal skeletal muscle sympathetic trafﬁc and plasma noradrenaline levels (Saul et al. 1990). (11) In dogs, heart failure increases sympathetic outﬂow as measured by direct recording of stellate ganglionic nervous activity, whereas in this setting LF power decreases (Piccirillo et al. 2009). (12) Perhaps most convincingly, in sheep with pacinginduced heart failure, in which directly measured cardiac sympathetic outﬂow is increased markedly, LF power in not increased, with or without normalization for total or mid-frequency power (Watson et al. 2007).

expected to increase, the former as part of the cephalic phase of digestion and the latter as a response to a tendency towards decreased total peripheral resistance because of postprandial shunting of blood towards the gut. Studies have disagreed about LF and HF power responses to meal ingestion. Ryan et al. (1992) reported that LF power increases in young but not old subjects, and HF power does not change regardless of subject age; Miyajima et al. (2001) noted no change in LF power and an increase in HF power; Kamath et al. (2007) found a tendency to increase LF power and no change in HF power after sham feeding (‘chew and spit’); Friesen et al. (2007), studying responses of children to meal ingestion, described increased LF and decreased HF power; and Vaz et al. (1995) reported no changes in LF or HF power, despite signiﬁcant increases in total body noradrenaline spillover.

Low-frequency power does not relate to sympathetic
nervous responses to acute manipulations
One might propose that acute changes in LF power reﬂect phasic changes in sympathetic outﬂow, even if there were no relationship at baseline. We considered the following four manipulations used in clinical laboratory testing: head-up tilt, exercise, mental arithmetic and meal ingestion.
Many studies have noted increases in LF:HF and normalized LF power during orthostasis. In this setting HF power usually decreases, and so the ratio of LF:HF and LF power normalized for total power of HRV would be expected to decrease, even if LF power remained unchanged. Low-frequency power considered alone does not consistently increase with orthostasis (Lipsitz et al. 1990; Hopf et al. 1995; Peles et al. 1995; Piccirillo et al. 1995; Vicek et al. 2008), despite approximately a doubling of plasma noradrenaline levels, although there are exceptions (Peles et al. 1995).
Low-frequency power also does not increase during exercise, with or without normalization for total power (Warren et al. 1997), whereas there are clear-cut increases in cardiac and extracardiac sympathetic outﬂows (Eisenhofer et al. 1992).
During laboratory psychological challenges, such as mental arithmetic, video games or the Stroop color– word conﬂict test, total body and cardiac spillovers of noradrenaline increase (Eisenhofer et al. 1992; Esler et al. 1995), indicating increased sympathoneural outﬂows. Concurrently, normalized LF power may (Moriguchi et al. 1992) or may not (Sloan et al. 1996) increase. Without normalization or adjustment for HF power, LF power does not increase during laboratory psychological challenges (Madden & Savard, 1995; Sloan et al. 1996; Hoshikawa & Yamamoto, 1997; Bernardi et al. 2000).
Meal ingestion represents a situation in which both parasympathetic and sympathetic outﬂows might be

Low-frequency power is related to baroreﬂex
function
A different perspective on the physiological meaning of LF power is based on a distinction between tone and modulation of autonomic outﬂows.
In the 1920s, Hering described reﬂexive falls in heart rate and blood pressure upon stimulation of a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve located near the bifurcation of the carotid arteries or upon intravascular stretching of this carotid sinus area (Hering, 1927). Subsequent studies of reﬂexive responses to increases or decreases in blood pressure in the carotid sinus (the baroreceptor reﬂex or baroreﬂex) and of reﬂexive responses to hypoxia and hypercarbia in the nearby carotid bodies (chemoreﬂexes) led to the Nobel Prize for Corneille Heymans in 1938 (Heymans & Neil, 1958). Relevant to the current discussion, Heymans emphasized effects of baroreﬂex stimulation on respiration. Carotid sinus stretching decreases the frequency of breathing.
When blood pressure increases acutely, heart rate decreases because of baroreﬂex stimulation. In the late 1960s, Smyth, Sleight and Pickering described a clinical method to measure baroreﬂex-cardiovagal gain (often called baroreﬂex sensitivity), based on the slope of the linear relationship between cardiac interbeat interval and systolic blood pressure after bolus I.V. injection of a pressor agent (Smyth et al. 1969), originally angiotensin but replaced soon after by phenylephrine (Bristow et al. 1969). Responses also to I.V. injection of a vasodilator enabled construction of baroreﬂex function curves. It soon became clear that baroreﬂex-cardiovagal failure is associated with the conditions noted above that are associated with decreased HRV, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, and myocardial infarction.
Several lines of evidence ﬁt with the concept that LF power is of central origin (Cooley et al. 1998) and in

particular support an association between LF power and baroreﬂex modulation of autonomic outﬂows (Saul et al. 1990), as summarized below.
(1) Sleight et al. (1995) demonstrated that carotid sinus stimulation produced by neck suction increases LF power only in individuals with normal baroreﬂex function and not in those with impaired baroreﬂex sensitivity.
(2) Patients with baroreﬂex failure, whether from carotid endarterectomy (Timmers et al. 2004), head and neck irradiation (Timmers et al. 1999; Sharabi et al. 2003), mixed cranial nerve neuroma (Guasti et al. 2010), neurosarcoidosis (Jardine et al. 2000) or brainstem stroke (Phillips et al. 2000), have very low values for LF power. Patients who have undergone neck irradiation also have attenuated responses of LF power to drugs that increase noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves (yohimbine, which increases exocytotic release, or tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release, independently of cardiac sympathetic innervation (Moak et al. 2007).
(3) Although individual values for the log of LF power do not correlate with cardiac sympathetic outﬂow, as indicated by cardiac noradrenaline spillover, they do correlate positively with the log of baroreﬂexcardiovagal gain (Moak et al. 2007; Rahman et al. 2011).
(4) Patients who are status post bilateral thoracic sympathectomies have normal baroreﬂex function and normal LF power, even though they have evidence for partial cardiac sympathetic denervation (Moak et al. 2005; Fig. 1).
(5) Evaluation of patient groups with chronic autonomic failure provides a powerful means to determine whether LF power is related to cardiac sympathetic innervation, baroreﬂex function or both, because chronic autonomic failure syndromes vary greatly in terms of cardiac sympathetic innervation. Three well-studied forms are pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy and Parkinson’s disease with orthostatic hypotension. Patients with pure autonomic failure and Parkinson’s disease with orthostatic hypotension have neuroimaging, neurochemical and postmortem neuropathological evidence of cardiac sympathetic denervation (Goldstein et al. 2000; Goldstein & Orimo, 2009), whereas most patients with multiple system atrophy have intact cardiac sympathetic innervation (Orimo et al. 2002) and normal cardiac noradrenaline spillover (Goldstein et al. 2000). All three diseases are associated with baroreﬂex-cardiovagal failure (Goldstein et al. 2003), and all three are associated with low LF power (Rahman et al. 2011). In our series, across all subjects the log of LF power

has shown a strong positive correlation with the log of HF power (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001). As a result of this, we cannot separate baroreﬂex modulation of sympathetic outﬂow from baroreﬂex modulation of parasympathetic outﬂow. (6) Although most patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation also have baroreﬂex failure, there are rare exceptions. Among subjects in our series with cardiac sympathetic denervation (less than 5000 nCikg cc-mCi−1 of septal 18F-ﬂuorodopamine-derived radioactivity) and normal baroreﬂex-cardiovagal gain (more than 2 ms mmHg−1), LF power is approximately normal (Moak et al. 2007). Mean values for this important group (n = 5) are depicted by the yellow circle with brown rim in Fig. 1). (7) A recent study showed that in conscious mice, carotid sinus, aortic and combined sino-aortic baroreceptor denervation decreases both LF and HF power (Rodrigues et al. 2011).
Conclusion
With or without adjustment for HF power, total power or respiration, LF power seems to provide an index not of cardiac sympathetic tone but of baroreﬂex function. Manipulations and drugs that change LF power or LF:HF may do so not by affecting cardiac autonomic outﬂows directly but by affecting modulation of those outﬂows by baroreﬂexes.
