Ischaemic heart disease and prodromes of sudden cardiac death Is it possible to identify high risk groups for sudden cardiac death?

SUMMARY A study was carried out to determine the incidence of sudden cardiac death in a well defined population in relation to prodromes, medical history, and previous medical consultations
before sudden cardiac death. In Frederiksborg county, Denmark (population 332 000), of 1309 consecutive deaths in a six month period, 166 were due to sudden cardiac death; among men aged 50-69, 22% of all deaths were due to sudden cardiac death. The incidence per 1000 population per year by age group (<50, 50-69, ¢70 years) was 0-19, 3*6, 11*4 in men and 0*12, 1.0, and 6-4 in women. The increasing incidence with age was significant. Ischaemic heart disease or hypertension had been recorded in 75% (124/166) of patients. Prodromes were reported in 54% (38/71) of patients with angina, and in 26% (25/95) without. Nineteen per cent (32/166) had neither prodromes nor overt heart disease. Forty six per cent of patients with known ischaemic heart disease and 24% without had consulted a doctor less than four weeks before death. Eight per cent had had a myocardial infarction within a year of death.

Cardiac death is the leading cause of death in most
countries in the industrialised world and accounts for 20-30% of all deaths. Approximately 604700/o1-3 of all cardiac deaths take place within 24 hours of the onset of acute symptoms and are often called sudden cardiac deaths. Sudden cardiac death is usually caused by ventricular arrhythmias with or without acute
myocardial infarction.4
Sudden cardiac death is frequently the first manifestation of ischaemic heart disease.' 2 It may be pre-
ceded by acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris.2 Furthermore, in patients admitted with suspected acute myocardial infarction, but in whom the diagnosis was ruled out, an increased risk of sudden death has been reported.67

DEFINITIONS
In this study sudden death was defined as unexpected natural death occurring instantaneously or within 24
hours after the onset of acute symptoms or signs.'3
The case was included if death was unwitnessed but likely to have fulfilled the above definition. Deaths among residents of nursing homes were not counted as sudden deaths. Sudden cardiac death was defined

as sudden death of which the cause was proved to be cardiac at necropsy or assumed to be cardiac because of clinical circumstances.
STUDY POPULATION
The basis for the study was all 218 cases of sudden death occurring between 1 May 1982 and 31 October 1982 in Frederiksborg County (population 332 000). A total of 1309 deaths had occurred during that period. Some of the cases were identified when reported to the coroner or following admission to any of the four regional hospitals. The remainder were identified from death certificates after careful checks with the doctor who had issued the death certificates. The diagnosis was based on necropsy findings in 118 cases and on death certificates in the remaining 100.
Of the 218 sudden deaths, 51 were of non-cardiac origin: 12 were due to pulmonary embolism, 21 to cerebrovascular disease, five to ruptured aortic aneurysm, four to gastrointestinal bleeding, three to asthma attacks, two to pneumonia, one to pulmonary carcinoma, one to epileptic seizure, and two to undetermined causes. In one case the general practitioner could not be identified. Thus the study population consisted of 166 cases of sudden cardiac death.
MEDICAL HISTORY
Information about prodromes, duration of fatal attack, and medical history was obtained from the coroner, police reports, hospital records, and from the patient's general practitioner, who in each case was asked to answer a standard questionnaire. Prodromes were defined as new symptoms or an aggravation of existing symptoms during the 14 days before death. Chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitation, and dizziness were classified as prodromes of cardiac origin. Systemic hypertension and congestive heart failure were considered to be present if the patient had been treated for either of these conditions. Previous admissions to coronary care units were noted. If an acute myocardial infarction had not been diagnosed such an admission was termed a "non-acute myocardial infarction episode."

STATISTICAL METHODS
The statistical methods used were the x2 test, Fisher's exact test, and a two sample t test. A p value of <0 05 was considered to be significant.
Results
Of 166 cases of sudden cardiac death, 58 were women (median age 76 (range 29-94) years) and 108 men (median age 67 (range 36-95) years). One hundred and eight deaths occurred at home, 27 after admission to hospital, five at work, four in ambulances, three during sporting activities, and 19 elsewhere.
One hundred deaths took place within one hour, 34 between one and six hours, and 32 between seven and 24 hours after the onset of acute symptoms. Sudden cardiac death accounted for 12-7% (95% confidence intervals, 10.9-14-6%) of all deaths. Sudden cardiac death was found more often in men (15.0%) than in women (9.7%) (p<0.001). In men it accounted for 22% of all deaths in the age group 50-59, significantly more than in older and younger men (p<0-01) (Table 1). In women it accounted for approximately the same proportion of all deaths regardles of age (NS) (Table 1). In the middle aged (50-69 years) significantly more deaths among men than among women were due to sudden cardiac death (p<0-01); in the older and younger age groups the proportions were similar for men and women (NS).

ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION
A history of ischaemic heart disease or hypertension was recorded in 124 cases (44 women, 80 men) and was more common in the older age group (Table 2, Fig. 1). Thirty eight patients had angina pectoris, 30 congestive heart failure, 90 previous acute myocardial infarction, and 20 hypertension.

PRODROMES TO SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH
Patients with ischaemic heart disease had prodromes more often than those without ischaemic heart disease
(Table 2) (p<005). This was due to a high prevalence of prodromes in patients with angina pectoris. When patients with angina pectoris are excluded there was no significant difference in the incidence of prodromes in patients with (36%) or without (23%)

RECENT MEDICAL CONSULTATION
Ninety six patients had seen a doctor within the two months before sudden cardiac death; 71 of these con-sultations were because of cardiac symptoms (Fig. 3a). Of the 124 patients with ischaemic heart disease or hypertension or both, 46% had seen a doctor within four weeks of death and, of the remaining 42 patients, 26% had seen a doctor during the same period (p<O0O5) (Fig. 3b).

Sudden cardiac death is an important cause of death in middle aged men, among whom almost a quarter of
all deaths are due to sudden cardiac death. This accords with the established fact that death due to
ischaemic heart disease is the main cause of death in
this group.
The incidence of sudden cardiac death in this study
(as given in Table 1) corresponds well with that in the
study of Romo from Helsinki even though he included only cases of sudden death occurring within
one hour of the onset of symptoms. 14 In men he found an incidence of 0.1 to 1 7 per 1000 under 50 years, of
1-7 to 6-4 from 50-69 years, and of 13-1 to 19-5 over 69 years. For women the corresponding figures were 0.1 to 0.2, 0-4 to 2.0, 1*5 to 7 1. In the FraminghamAlbany study of men the incidence per 1000 was 1-2, 3.9, and 3-0 respectively in age groups 45-54, 55-64, and 65-74.'S This differs from Romo's findings and
from our own as regards the oldest age group. The
difference is difficult to explain, but in the Framingham-Albany study only 10 deaths in this age
group were recorded.
One approach to prevention of sudden cardiac death may be to identify and treat subjects at greatest risk. In this study 75% of all patients who died of sudden cardiac death had manifest ischaemic heart disease or hypertension. A similar proportion was found in Baltimore3 but a lower one in other studies.' 16 In the present study ischaemic heart disease was not recorded in 70% of all patients with sudden cardiac death under 50 years of age and in 45% between 50 and 69 years of age (Fig. 1). Table 4 shows the estimated prevalence of ischaemic heart disease, defined as previous acute myocardial infarction or existing angina pectoris, in the Danish population. The estimate is based on other Danish population studies. 17-19 On the basis of these figures is calculated the incidence of sudden cardiac death in subjects with and without ischaemic heart disease. Among younger subjects sudden cardiac death occurs mainly in those without known ischaemic heart disease, whereas in middle aged men an equal number occurs in men with
