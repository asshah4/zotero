This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether ␤ blockers inﬂuence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n ‫ ؍‬88) or placebo (n ‫ ؍‬96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/ congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ؎ 0.1 to 5.17 ؎ 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated

patients (4.26 ؎ 0.09 to 4.77 ؎ 0.1 ms2, p <0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ؎ 0.24 to 3.86 ؎ 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ؎ 0.29 to 3.17 ؎ 0.23, p <0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These ﬁndings may elucidate the mechanisms by which ␤ blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. ᮊ2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

Whether ␤ blockers alter the extent or timing of recovery of heart rate variability (HRV), a predictor of mortality in patients after acute myocardial infarction,1–3 has not been well studied. Several studies have shown an effect of ␤ blockers on altering indexes of HRV, a measure of changing sympathetic and parasympathetic activity transmitted to the sinoatrial node,4,5 in normal subjects5,6 and in patients with coronary artery disease.7–9 Similar effects have been suggested in patients after they have had acute myocardial infarction,10–14 in small or nonrandomized studies. The inter-relation of ␤ blockers, HRV, and outcome has not been evaluated in a single study. To assess these effects, we analyzed HRV from ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings in a subset of patients enrolled in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), a large randomized, placebo-

controlled study of propranolol versus placebo in patients with acute myocardial infarction, whose demonstrated reduction in mortality, from 9.8% in the placebo-treated group to 7.2% in the propranololtreated group,15,16 continues to guide therapy after acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS Study population: The BHAT study population in-
cluded 3,837 patients between age 30 and 69 years (mean 54; 85% male) hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction from June 6, 1978 to October 2, 1980 (from 134 hospitals in 31 United States and Canadian centers). Acute myocardial infarction was documented by symptoms, electrocardiograms, and enzymes. Patients were excluded from the study if they had contraindications to ␤ blockade, such as bradycardia, severe congestive heart failure, or asthma; other life-threatening illness; were likely to undergo cardiac surgery; or if they were already taking ␤ blockers. Patients were randomized to receive propranolol or placebo in a double-blind manner during the initial hospitalization, 5 to 21 days after admission. Treated patients received propanolol at a dose of 180 or 240 mg/day based on blood levels. Twenty-four-

hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring was not mandatory but was obtained at the time of randomization before initiation of therapy in 3,279 patients and 6 weeks later in a random sample of 25% (419 propranolol and 407 placebo-treated patients). Details of the BHAT study design and results have been previously described.15,16
The present study population was drawn from a subset of the BHAT cohort enrolled in the Health Insurance Plan substudy, which included 2320 male patients (60% of the entire BHAT study group). As in the overall group, 25% of the Health Insurance Plan patients were randomly assigned to undergo 6-week follow-up Holter monitoring (approximately 580 patients). Of these patients, 325 had baseline and 6-week Holter recordings available for scanning. Less than 5% of the recordings could not be scanned because of tape deterioration. Within this group, 88 propanololtreated and 96 placebo-treated patients had baseline and 6-week follow-up Holter recordings of sufﬁcient length and without excess ectopics and/or noise (see the following). These 184 patients comprised the study population of this investigation.
Processing of Holter recordings: Holter reel-to-reel recordings generated on Delmar Avionics recorders (Irvine, California) were digitally sampled (128 Hz) and analyzed using a Zymed system (Oxnard, California). Each tape was manually processed and edited to ensure accurate identiﬁcation of QRS complexes. A list of RR intervals with annotations denoting normal beats, types of ectopics, and noise was saved and later transferred to a Sun workstation (Santa Clara, California) for further processing and analysis with customized software.
Frequency-domain analysis: Before spectral analysis, the RR interval data ﬁle was ﬁrst edited to remove ectopics and noise. The gaps resulting from edits were ﬁlled in by interpolated linear splines.17 Holter recordings of patients with Ͼ20% interpolated RR intervals or Ͻ18 total recorded hours were excluded from further analysis. The RR interval time series was sampled using a boxcar window18 to give 1,024 samples/5 minutes (3.41333 Hz) to generate a uniformly spaced instantaneous heart rate time series. The heart rate spectrum was computed using a fast-Fourier transform with a Parzen window. The fast-Fourier transform was performed on sequential 1-hour segments and on the entire RR interval ﬁle (18 to 24 hours). Because the fast-Fourier transform routines were optimized for sequences with lengths equal to multiples of small primes,2,3,5 considerable ﬂexibility was available in processing patient ﬁles of differing duration. The power spectrum was corrected for attenuation due to windowing and sampling.19 For both the 1- and 24hour analyses, the power spectrum was integrated over 5 discrete frequency bands as deﬁned by Bigger et al1,20: ultra LF Ͻ0.0033 Hz; very LF 0.0033 to Ͻ0.04 Hz; LF 0.04 to Ͻ0.15 Hz; HF 0.15 to 0.40 Hz, and total power. The ratio of LF to HF power was measured as an index of sympathovagal balance.5 For analysis of circadian patterns, results from the analysis of 1-hour segments were averaged over four 6-hour

time blocks: midnight to 6 A.M. (MN), 6A.M. to noon (AM), noon to 6 P.M. (Noon), and 6 P.M. to midnight (PM), respectively.
Time-domain analysis: Three conventional time-domain indexes of HRV were computed for the entire Holter recording and for consecutive 1-hour segments: (1) percent of adjacent normal to normal (NN) intervals differing by Ͼ50 ms (pNN50), (2) the root-meansquare of differences in successive NN intervals (rMSSD), and (3) the SD of NN intervals (SDNN). As in the frequency-domain analysis, 1-hour measurements were aggregated into the four 6-hour time blocks—MN, AM, Noon, and PM for analysis of circadian patterns.
Follow-up: Mean follow-up in the BHAT was 25 months. BHAT end points of death, acute myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure were combined into a composite end point for analysis of outcome in the present study.
Statistical analyses: For univariate analysis, unpaired t test or chi-square test were used. All HRV parameters except SDNN were highly skewed, and therefore, log-transformed for statistical analysis.1 A repeated measures 2-way analysis of variance was used to study the effects of time (baseline to followup) and the interaction of time and treatment on HRV measurements. A signiﬁcant interaction effect was taken to indicate that propranolol inﬂuenced measured HRV parameters apart from any effects of time. A repeated measures 2-way analysis of variance was also employed to study whether propranolol treatment at follow-up had a differential effect when compared with placebo on the circadian variation of HRV parameters. Circadian variation was deﬁned by the pattern of HRV parameter changes over the 4 time periods of the day (MN, AM, Noon, PM). Analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed using the standard least-squares regression and the multivariate analysis of variance platforms. Stratiﬁed analysis of effects of propranolol on HRV parameters was performed based on presence or absence of “mechanical complications,” including pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, rales, or symptoms and/or signs of congestive heart failure, as deﬁned in previous BHAT analyses.21 Evaluation of effects of propranolol and HRV parameters on outcome was performed with multiple logistic regression. Clinical variables were controlled for age, diabetes, hypertension, New York Heart Association class at enrollment, presence of rales, and ventricular arrhythmia (deﬁned in BHAT as Ն3 successive premature ventricular contractions or ventricular ﬁbrillation.) All statistics were computed using JMP software (SAS Institute, Inc., Version 3.1.6, Cary, North Carolina). A p value of Ͻ0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
RESULTS Patient population: Demographic variables for the
propranolol and placebo groups are listed in Table 1. All patients in this subset were male. Overall, baseline characteristics were similar in this subgroup to the

Frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability: Twenty-four-hour frequency-domain measures of HRV (log-normalized) at baseline and at 6 weeks in
␤-blocker and placebo groups are listed in Table 2. As seen in Figure 1, HF power increased signiﬁcantly in
both groups at 6 weeks; however, there was a signif-
icantly greater increase in propranolol-treated patients
(21% in propranolol-treated vs 12% in placebotreated, p ϭ 0.02 for propranolol effect above the effects of time). LF, very LF, ultra LF, and total power
increased in both groups at 6 weeks but were not affected by ␤-blocker treatment. At 6 weeks, the LF/HF ratio in placebo-treated patients was greater than at baseline but had decreased in the ␤-blocker treated patients (p Ͻ0.01) (Figure 2).
Time-domain measures of heart rate variability: All time-domain measures increased signiﬁcantly from baseline to 6-week follow-up (p Ͻ0.01). There was a signiﬁcantly greater increase in pNN50 and rMSSD (p Ͻ0.01 for propranolol effect above the effect of time), but not SDNN, in the treated patients.
Circadian variation of heart rate variability measures: At 6 weeks, the placebo group showed an expected circadian variation in the LF/HF ratio, with an
abrupt increase in the morning, high levels throughout
the day, and decreasing at night, which was not seen in
the propranolol-treated patients (Figure 3). The pat-
tern of circadian variation differed signiﬁcantly between groups (p Ͻ0.05). Both HF and LF showed circadian variation with power higher at night and

Correlations with outcome: Similar to the results of the overall BHAT, propranolol in this subgroup improved outcome. The combined outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure (used in all further analyses), occurred in 23% of the untreated patients, compared with a 9% incidence in the patients who received ␤ blockers (p ϭ 0.02). Death occurred in 9.4% of placebo and 4.5% of treated patients (p ϭ NS). In this population, HRV at 6 weeks predicted outcome. Although ultra LF, very LF, LF, and HF predicted outcome in univariate analysis, only HF power remained signiﬁcant in multivariable regression. Similarly, in the time domain, SD, pNN50, and rMSSD were univariate predictors, but pNN50 was the only independent predictor. RR interval did not signiﬁcantly predict outcome in the univariate or multivariate analyses.
HF power was then dichotomized at the ﬁrst quartile for further analysis. Death, acute myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure occurred in 2% of those in the highest quartile, compared with 21% of those in the lower quartiles (p Ͻ0.01). In multivariable analysis, propranolol and high HF power exerted

signiﬁcant and independent effects. To further evaluate the inter-relation between propranolol, HF power, and outcome, event rates were compared by treatment and HF status, as shown in Table 3. Patients with high HF power, whether achieved through treatment with propranolol (60% of those in the highest quartile of HF) or spontaneously in those patients given placebo, had excellent outcomes. In patients with low HF despite treatment with propranolol, relative risk was still improved over placebo-treated patients with similar HF power.
Stratiﬁed analysis of propranolol effects on autonomic parameters based on presence of mechanical complications: Patients with mechanical complications had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events than did those without complications (28% vs 13%, p
Ͻ0.05), and the impact of ␤ blockers on event rate was signiﬁcant only in those with mechanical complications. As shown in Table 4, propranolol signiﬁcantly improved HF power in those with, but not those without, mechanical complications.
DISCUSSION This analysis shows that propranolol increases the
recovery of parasympathetic tone in patients with acute myocardial infarction, as measured by HF power, pNN50, and rMSSD; it also alters autonomic balance at 6 weeks, as measured by the LF/HF ratio. Improvement in vagal tone was further correlated with improvement in outcome, suggesting that propranolol effects are mediated in part through this effect. Propranolol blunted the early morning increase in sympathetic dominance of autonomic balance, the time period of maximum cardiovascular events.22–24

olol on recovery of HRV and the inter-relation with outcome. The study design included a ﬁrst Holter recording in-hospital before randomization and a second 6 weeks after administration of placebo or ␤ blocker, or about 8 weeks after acute myocardial infarction, close to the previously described 6- to 12-week plateau of HRV recovery in untreated patients.25,26 In these studies of untreated patients, recovery of HRV did not reach that of age and gendermatched normal controls. In the present study, while HF power in the untreated group at 6 weeks (8 weeks post-acute myocardial infarction) was similar to that described in 12-week post-acute myocardial infarction patients by Bigger et al,25 the recovery level of HF in the ␤-blocked group was similar to that of the normal controls.
Effect of propranolol on autonomic function as measured by HRV: Evaluation of the effects of propranolol on HRV may help elucidate mechanisms by which propranolol exerts its beneﬁcial effects. Consistent with the previously described studies, recovery of HRV from its initial post-acute myocardial infarction nadir was seen in placebo- and propranolol-treated patients. Propranolol, however, signiﬁcantly improved the recovery of HF power over time. HF power is abolished by parasympathetic blockade4 and thus provides a marker of parasympathetic activity. That HF increased after 6 weeks of propanolol treatment implies that this drug acts to increase parasympathetic tone. Previous studies have shown a similar effect on HF power in normal subjects,5,6 (with 1 exception9) and in patients with coronary artery disease.7,8 Although previous smaller studies in patients with acute myocardial infarction have suggested an increase in
HRV parameters with ␤ blockade,10–14 these trials were either not controlled13,14 or crossover12; the study size was not stated in 110 and 1 randomized only 25 patients to therapy.11
With propranolol therapy, there was no enhanced recovery of LF power, which reﬂects sympathetic, parasympathetic, and possibly other neurohormonal inﬂuences. However, there was a dramatic differential treatment effect on the LF/HF ratio, with this parameter increasing after 6 weeks in placebo-treated patients but decreasing in the ␤-blocker treated group. Most data suggest this ratio is an index of sympathetic predominance. Although the LF/HF ratio has not been shown to correlate with cardiac norepinephrine spillover,27 LF/HF increases with orthostatic challenge,5 and shows circadian variations similar to those of plasma catecholamines.28,29 The increase in LF/HF over time in placebo-treated patients in this study may reﬂect an increase in sympathetic activity, due to the resumption of upright posture with daily activities by the time of the follow-up outpatient Holter monitoring, which was blocked by propranolol.
Interaction of congestive heart failure and effects of propranolol on autonomic parameters: As in previous analyses of BHAT,21,30 in this subpopulation, evidence of congestive heart failure as manifested by “mechanical complications” was associated with an increased event rate, and it was these patients in whom

propranolol treatment most improved outcome. Interestingly, it was in these sickest patients that propranolol increased vagal tone as measured by HF power, suggesting that this action may in part mediate propranolol’s beneﬁcial effects in this population.
Study limitations: Ambulatory electrocardiograms were recorded reel-to-reel in 1978 to 1980, using technology that did not include a time-track or calibration signals, which would have conﬁrmed the accuracy and lack of deterioration of the tapes after storage. The original reel-to-reel recordings were scanned without a phase-lock loop system, which may have introduced a very small amount of HF distortion.1,18 However, any contamination of the data by noise or technical imprecision should be similar for both groups, and HRV values for the immediate postacute myocardial infarction and the 2-month placebotreated patients are similar to those previously published,25 suggesting technical accuracy was within an adequate range. Results of this study are limited by the subpopulation studied, which included only men (85% of the original BHAT group). Whether these results can be extrapolated to women requires further investigation. Left ventricular function was not measured in the BHAT trial, and thus possible differential effects of propranolol among patients based on left ventricular function cannot be determined. The number of cardiovascular outcomes experienced by the patients in this group was limited by the relatively short duration of follow-up in BHAT (25 months).
