Abstract 
Exercise reduces ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury in the rat stroke model. We investigated whether pre-ischemic exercise ameliorates blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in stroke by reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression and strengthening basal lamina. 
 
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to a 30 min exercise program on a treadmill 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Stroke was induce
