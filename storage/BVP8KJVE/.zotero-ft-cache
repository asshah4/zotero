The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Outcomes Project has successfully initiated a shift in focus on residency education from process measures to educational outcomes. The next phase of this transformation is the development of clear milestones to mark incremental steps toward competency. The development of these milestones for internal medicine is an important and challenging task that has been undertaken by a group of educators and residents facilitated by the American Board of Internal Medicine. Representatives from multiple key stakeholder groups are participating in this initiative, including, but not limited to, the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine, the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine, the Society of General Internal Medicine, and the American College of Physicians. This project will advance our understanding of the incremental achievement of competency in the many areas of professional development and inform the even more difﬁcult next task of developing reliable tools to assess a resident’s progress toward competency.1
If successful, this initiative will vastly improve current methods of evaluating residency programs and individual practitioners. With milestones and assessment tools in place, the Accreditation Council for Grad-

uate Medical Education will measure the success of residency programs by the growth of their residents, rather than by the program’s ability to conform to process rules.2 Likewise, with milestones and assessment tools in place, the American Board of Internal Medicine will certify individual practitioners with conﬁdence that they have achieved competency not just in medical knowledge, the only area currently objectively assessed, but in the 5 remaining core competencies. We, the authors, fully support both of these objectives.
We believe there will be signiﬁcant beneﬁts to individual residents and program directors. Residents will be empowered with a clear set of expectations that will allow monitoring of their own progress, as well as establishing and pursuing personal learning goals. Program directors will be able to monitor residents’ progress, identify those who are not reaching goals on schedule, and plan timely remediation.
Competency-based assessment also will allow identiﬁcation of residents who are progressing more rapidly than expected.3,4 We believe the choices we make about these “advanced” residents are critical and carry inherent risks that have not received sufﬁcient attention. Some have suggested that once measurable competency is achieved, it makes sense for the resident to leave the core program and move on to the next step of their career, whether that is fellowship or practice. Advancement would be based not on the passage of an arbitrary period of time—3 years in the case of internal medicine— but on the achievement of competency.5 Though this concept is initially compelling, we urge caution in moving training in this direction.6 This approach ignores important realities that, if unaddressed,

possible only by providing service in the care of patients. Residency programs have been entrusted with establishing teaching services to meet this end, and this commitment to stafﬁng a residency service is ﬁxed: Because patient needs are constant, the service cannot be sometimes staffed and sometimes not. The current model of training enables a program director to assess resources to ensure stafﬁng of the medical service that is central to the residents’ educational needs, as well as the patients’ clinical needs. The proposal for early graduation based on competence would transform a ﬁxed system into a ﬂuid system, with intermittent periods of non-stafﬁng proportional to the volume of residents who leave the program early.
Educating the physician requires emotional engagement that is only accomplished when residents develop authentic personal accountability for their patients; a system that teaches that accountability is contingent on available residents detracts from this message. Teaching services must be constructed such that the implicit message is to encourage residents’ sense of ownership of their patients, as well as allowing for incremental autonomy up to and including complete independence. Only on services where residents are consistently present and engaged with all other members of the health care team can the necessary levels of responsibility, accountability, and autonomy be maintained. Once a system has been fully calibrated and staffed to function without residents, residents begin to assume the mentality of visitors rather than full participants.
An alternative to variable stafﬁng on core teaching services would be to maintain full stafﬁng on these services at all times to ensure their integrity by moving remaining residents from elective to core experiences to compensate for residents who have advanced early. This would sacriﬁce educational balance for the remaining residents, denying them career-deﬁning clinical elective experiences or research opportunities. The good of the many residents and the learning environment of the program would be sacriﬁced for the beneﬁt of the few.
THE PITFALLS OF EARLY TRANSITION TO FELLOWSHIP: ACCOUNTABILITY TO ALL SUBSPECIALTIES AND TO FAIRNESS IN CAREER DECISION-MAKING
Competency-based advancement will allow some residents to begin fellowship after only 2 years of core internal medicine training. We acknowledge that wellestablished milestones and assessment tools may allow identiﬁcation of a small number of residents who achieve competency after only 2 years. Practically, however, this determination could not be made until well into the second postgraduate year, certainly no more than 6 months before the proposed advancement

to fellowship would occur. The current fellowship application and selection process requires applicants to interview 14 to 18 months before their fellowship begins and ﬁlls all slots more than 1 year in advance. Competency-based advancement to fellowship after 2 years is not compatible with this application/selection paradigm, unless fellowship programs would be willing to interview and select applicants during their second postgraduate year without any assurance that they would be ready to advance at the end of their second postgraduate year.
Allowing early transition to fellowship may have additional unintended consequences. Residents considering competitive subspecialty careers will quickly learn that their best chance to enter fellowship is to pursue early advancement and to focus elective and research experiences (eg, cardiology or gastroenterology) to the exclusion of exploring lesscompetitive generalist or subspecialty careers. This will lead to premature career decision closure. Further, because of the timing and logistics of creating a match, it is likely that accelerated residents will only be able to move into fellowships at their “home” institution. This will quickly disadvantage community hospital programs that do not have the spectrum of fellowships.
Finally, the consequences would be dire for residents selected for early advancement who suddenly had to cancel all of their plans because they did not achieve competency. Likewise, the fellowship would have to deal with an unﬁlled position very late in the process. Realizing this, core residency programs might feel pressure to pass on less-than-competent residents to the next level of training simply because plans had been made. This would not be in the best interests of either the candidate or the fellowship.
CONCLUSIONS
We applaud and support the movement to competencybased education based on developmental milestones and reliable methods of assessment. We believe that graduate medical education programs should be judged on the quality of their educational outcomes, and that individual practitioners should be certiﬁed on the basis of achievement of broad-based competency in their discipline.
At the same time we urge caution regarding implementation of a system of advancement that encourages residents to leave core training and move on to the next step as soon as minimum competency is established. We believe such a system will:
● disrupt the delicate learning community of residency programs;
● encourage residents to consider their own interests to the exclusion of those of their colleagues;

Bordley et al Competency-based Advancement
● reduce core residency programs to the pursuit of adequacy rather than excellence; and
● threaten the integrity of teaching services as they currently exist.
We believe the academic internal medicine community can encourage individualized learning so that residents are always pushing themselves beyond their comfort zone, always increasing their knowledge and skills. Residency programs and program directors should not be satisﬁed with achieving adequacy for all residents. There is always more to learn and always a higher level to aspire to, even after the agreed on minimum bar has been cleared. Indeed, the American Board of Internal Medicine’s focus on ongoing competency through the maintenance of the certiﬁcation process emphasizes that there is no end point to competence. A premature closure to residency training would seem to send a contradictory message to our future physicians. Time spent in the

core program after the achievement of minimum competency is time well spent in pursuit of excellence, not time wasted.
