BACKGROUND Although many patients with venous thromboembolism require extended treatment, it is uncertain whether it is better to use full- or lower-intensity anticoagulation therapy or aspirin.
METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, we assigned 3396 patients with venous thromboembolism to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. All the study patients had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Study drugs were administered for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous thromboembolism, and the principal safety outcome was major bleeding.
RESULTS A total of 3365 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (median treatment duration, 351 days). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 17 of 1107 patients (1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P<0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4% in the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the aspirin group; the rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7%, 2.0%, and 1.8%, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups.

CONCLUSIONS Among patients with venous thromboembolism in equipoise for continued anticoagulation, the risk of a recurrent event was significantly lower with rivaroxaban at either a treatment dose (20 mg) or a prophylactic dose (10 mg) than with aspirin, without a significant increase in bleeding rates.

Venous thromboembolism, which includes deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is the third most common cause of vascular death after myocardial infarction and stroke.1-3 The mainstay of treatment is anticoagulation,4 and in patients without active cancer, guidelines suggest the use of direct oral anticoagulant agents such as rivaroxaban over vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin.4 Anticoagulation therapy is administered for 3 months or longer, depending on the balance between the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism and the risk of bleeding.4 In patients without reversible risk factors, the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism is as much as 10% in the first year if anticoagulation therapy is stopped.5-9 Patients in whom thrombosis was triggered by nonsurgical risk factors or who have persistent risk factors are at higher risk for recurrence than are those with postoperative thrombosis.10 In addition, because of overlapping risk factors, patients with venous thromboembolism are at increased risk for arterial thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death.11-13 Although extended anticoagulation therapy is effective for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism,5-9 concern about bleeding often leads to a reluctance to continue anticoagulant treatment beyond 6 to 12 months. Attempts to reduce the risk of bleeding when treatment is extended include the use of lower-dose anticoagulant therapy and the use of aspirin in place of an anticoagulant agent.6,12-14
At a dose of 20 mg once daily, rivaroxaban is effective for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation15 and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism after an initial 21-day course of higher-dose therapy.7,16,17 At a dose of 10 mg once daily, rivaroxaban provides effective thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty.18-21 In the Reduced-dosed Rivaroxaban in the Long-term Prevention of Recurrent Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism (EINSTEIN CHOICE) trial,22 we compared the efficacy and safety of these two doses of rivaroxaban with those of aspirin in patients with venous thromboembolism who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and for whom there was equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Secondary aims of the study were to determine whether the lower dose of rivaroxaban was as effective as the higher dose and whether it was associated with less bleeding.

Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of two doses of rivaroxaban with those of aspirin for the extended treatment of venous thromboembolism for up to 1 year after the initial 6 to 12 months of therapy.22 The trial was sponsored by Bayer Pharmaceuticals. The steering committee, which included both academic authors and those employed by the sponsor, had final responsibility for the design of the study, the development of the protocol, the oversight of the study, the verification of the data, and the analyses. The sponsor collected, maintained, and analyzed the data; the academic authors had access to the data at all times through the sponsor. The protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients.
An independent committee whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments adjudicated the qualifying initial diagnosis (deepvein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) and all suspected outcomes that occurred during the study. An independent data and safety monitoring committee periodically reviewed the study outcomes. All the members of the steering committee contributed to the interpretation of the results. The first three authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and all the steering committee members contributed to subsequent versions, made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.
Patients
Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were 18 years of age or older; had objectively confirmed, symptomatic proximal deepvein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; had been treated for 6 to 12 months with an anticoagulant agent, including a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant agent such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban; and had not interrupted therapy for more than 7 days before randomization.
Patients were ineligible if they had a contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or

(intention-to-treat population). The per-protocol population excluded patients who had a rate of adherence to the study-drug regimen of less than 80% or who had other major protocol violations. Efficacy outcomes were considered during the individual intended treatment period, whereas safety outcomes were considered during the time from administration of the first dose of a study drug to 48 hours after the administration of the last dose. Efficacy and safety outcomes were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportionalhazards model, stratified according to the index diagnosis (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). Kaplan–Meier curves were constructed to display the distribution of events over time.
Results
Study Patients From March 2014 through March 2016, a total of 3396 patients from 244 sites in 31 countries

were enrolled. After the exclusion of 31 patients (0.9%) because they did not receive any study drug, 3365 patients were included in the primary analyses. The characteristics of patients in the three study groups were similar at baseline, as was the median duration of study treatment (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the random assignment and follow-up of the patients.
Efficacy
A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 17 of 1107 patients (1.5%) who were receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) who were receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) who were receiving aspirin. Fatal venous thromboembolism occurred in 2 patients (0.2%) who were receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, in no patients who were receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and in 2 patients (0.2%) who were receiving aspirin (Table 2). Both rivaroxaban doses were superior to aspirin

The per-protocol population included all those in the intention-to-treat population with the exception of those who had a rate of adherence to the study-drug regimen of less than 80% or who had other major protocol violations. The main reasons for premature discontinuation of a study medication were adverse events, nonadherence to the study-drug regimen, protocol violations, and efficacy or safety outcomes.

The hazard ratio for the comparison between the 20-mg and 10-mg rivaroxaban regimens was 1.34 (95% CI, 0.65 to 2.75; P = 0.42). Similar results were found for the other efficacy outcomes (Table 2, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
With aspirin, the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism was 3.6% among the patients in whom the index event was provoked (i.e., associated with a known event, such as surgery or hospital admission) and 5.6% among those in whom the index event was unprovoked (i.e., idiopathic) (Table 3). Rates of recurrence in patients whose index events were provoked or unprovoked were lower in both the 20-mg rivaroxaban group (1.4% and 1.8%, respectively) and the 10-mg rivaroxaban group (0.9% and 1.5%, respectively) than in the aspirin group. Figure 2A shows the time course of symptomatic fatal or nonfatal recurrent venous thromboembolism. Of the 31 patients who were excluded from the analyses because they did not take any study drug, 1 patient who was assigned to receive 20 mg of rivaroxaban had a nonfatal primary efficacy outcome event.
Safety
Major bleeding occurred in 6 patients (0.5%) in the 20-mg rivaroxaban group and in 5 patients (0.4%) in the 10-mg rivaroxaban group, as compared with 3 patients (0.3%) in the aspirin group (Table 4). Figure 2B shows the time course of major bleeding episodes.
Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 30 patients (2.7%) in the 20-mg rivaroxaban group and in 22 patients (2.0%) in the 10-mg rivaroxaban group, as compared with 20 patients (1.8%) in the aspirin group (Table 4). Similar results were found for the composite outcome of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Nonmajor bleeding that was associated with a study-drug interruption for more than 14 days occurred in 17 patients (1.5%) in the 20-mg rivaroxaban group and in 12 patients (1.1%) in the 10-mg rivaroxaban group, as compared with 12 patients (1.1%) in the aspirin group.

*	R ecurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Major bleeding was assessed in the same population but during the period of study-drug administration plus a window of 2 days.

Other Outcomes
Myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism occurred in 3 patients (0.3%) in the 20-mg rivaroxaban group, in 5 patients (0.4%) in the 10-mg rivaroxaban group, and in 7 patients (0.6%) in the aspirin group (Table 2). The rates of death from any cause were 0.7% and 0.2% in the 20-mg and 10-mg rivaroxaban groups, respectively, as compared with 0.6% in the aspirin group. Rates of adverse events were similar in the three study groups (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy outcome and the composite outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, results were consistent with the overall treatment effects (Figs. S1 through S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the 30-day follow-up after the end of the active study period, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 2 patients (0.2%) in the 20-mg rivaroxaban group, in 4 patients (0.4%) in the 10-mg rivaroxaban group, and in 6 patients (0.6%) in the aspirin group.

Discussion
Clinical strategies for extended anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism are uncertain. Previous studies have shown that as compared with placebo, aspirin reduced the relative risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism by 32% (2.4 percentage points),12,13 whereas a 20-mg dose of rivaroxaban reduced the relative risk by 82% (6.8 percentage points).7 Consistent with those findings, our study shows that as compared with aspirin, both the 20-mg and 10-mg doses of rivaroxaban reduced the relative risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism by about 70% (approximately 3 percentage points). These benefits were observed with rates of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding that were low and similar to those with aspirin. Therefore, we found that rivaroxaban was more effective than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism and was associated with a similar risk of bleeding.
What are the clinical implications of these findings? This study included patients with both

Rivaroxaban or Aspirin for Venous Thromboembolism

provoked and unprovoked venous thromboembolism for whom there was equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism are known to be at high risk for recurrence, but the risk of recurrence among those in whom venous thromboembolism was provoked by minor transient or persistent risk factors is less certain. We found that patients with venous thromboembolism with ongoing risk factors have an appreciable risk of recurrence because even with aspirin, the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism in such patients was 3.6%, as compared with a rate of recurrence of 5.6% in those with unprovoked venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban reduced the relative risk of recurrence by about 70% in patients with both unprovoked and provoked venous thromboembolism. Consequently, the number of patients who would need to be treated for up to 12 months with rivaroxaban instead of aspirin to prevent one episode of fatal or nonfatal recurrent venous thromboembolism without increasing the risk of bleeding was 33 with the 20-mg dose and 30 with the 10-mg dose. Prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism is particularly important, because the case-fatality rate at 30 days is at least twice as high with pulmonary embolism as with deep-vein thrombosis.27
Our study has several potential limitations. First, patients who required extended treatment with therapeutic doses of anticoagulant agents were excluded. Therefore, it remains unknown whether the 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban would be sufficient to prevent recurrence in such patients. Second, in this study and in the previous trial comparing rivaroxaban with placebo for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism, therapy was given for up to 12 months. Consequently, additional studies are needed to determine the utility of continuing treatment for longer periods. Third, our study was not powered to show the noninferiority of the 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban to the established treatment regimen of 20 mg, so any conclusions with respect to this issue are speculative.
In conclusion, we found that rivaroxaban, at

both a treatment dose (20 mg) and a thromboprophylactic dose (10 mg), was more effective than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism among patients who were in equipoise for continued anticoagulation. The lower risk of a recurrent event among the patients who received rivaroxaban was associated with a rate of bleeding similar to that with aspirin.
