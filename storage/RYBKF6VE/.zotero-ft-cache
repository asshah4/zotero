Abstract The rich autonomic innervation of the heart
plays an important role in modifying cardiovascular function. Recently developed in vivo scintigraphic imaging techniques allow for visualization of the autonomic innervation of the heart. Studies using the modalities have shown heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in various kinds of pathological conditions as well as normal human heart. The inferioposterior region shows typically less sympathetic innervation than the anterior region. In addition, neuropathic processes appear to commence in inferior-apical regions extending towards the base of the heart. Arrhythmogeneity has been related to the heterogeneous innervation of the heart and heterogeneous uptake of radiolabeled catecholamine analogues, such as I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine, can be found in patients with arrhythmia. In dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced uptake indicates a poor prognosis which allows risk stratiﬁcation for patients with heart failure. Heterogeneity of the reinnervation process following heart transplantation has also been investigated. Evidence was found of reinnervation primarily in the basal anterioseptal region and to a lesser degree in the inferioposterior and apical regions. Tracer approaches are uniquely suited to identify regionally altered innervation and provide tools for linking information on cardiac autonomic innervation with other clinical aspects.

autonomic regulation by the central nervous system and physiological processes. Recently developed in vivo scintigraphic imaging enables the autonomic innervation of the heart to be visualized (35, 54, 66). However the sparse cholinergic innervation of the ventricles limits the presynaptic evaluation of this system in vivo. Therefore, most imaging approaches focus on the scintigraphic delineation of the sympathetic nervous systems because the left and right ventricles are densely innervated by sympathetic ﬁbers. Studies using these modalities have shown heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in various kinds of pathological conditions (17, 26, 30, 45, 52, 59, 63, 67) as well as the normal human heart (14, 33, 47, 62). As autonomic heterogeneity has been linked to arrhythmias and sudden death, it appears important to study the heterogeneity of the heart (5, 8). Heterogeneity of the reinnervation process following heart transplantation has also been investigated (4, 31, 53) and this together with the above will be discussed in this brief review.
Anatomical and functional autonomic nerve projections to the heart
Autonomic nerve projections into the heart promote understanding of how the autonomic nervous system regulates the heart (Fig. 1). James et al. (19) described the anatomy of cardiac sympathetic nerve projections into the human heart. The right stellate cardiopulmonary nerve, from the right stellate ganglia, courses through the dorsal nerve plexus to the left lateral cardiopulmonary
Fig. 1 Cardiac nerve projections to the heart (MCG middle cervical ganglia; SG stellate ganglia; rt right; lt left; StCPN stellate cardiopulmonary nerve; VCPN ventral cardiopulmonary nerve; DLCPN dorsal lateral cardiopulmonary nerve; DMCPN dorsal medial cardiopulmonary nerve; CoroCN coronary cardiac nerve; LCN lateral cardiac nerve; RA right atria; LA left atria).

nerve and projects into the lateral wall of the left ventricle. The dorsal medial and lateral cardiopulmonary nerves, from the central cervical ganglia, form the left coronary nerve which runs alongside the main left coronary artery. The coronary artery, in turn, separates into two branches running alongside the circumﬂex and left anterior descending coronary arteries and on into the adjacent epicardium. The left ventral cardiopulmonary nerve, from the left cervical ganglia, connects solely to the right coronary cardiac nerve which runs adjacent to the right coronary artery and projects into the right ventricle and inferior posterior wall of the left ventricle. The left dorsal cardiopulmonary nerves join with the right dorsal cardiopulmonary nerves to form the dorsal plexus and the left coronary cardiac nerve: a connection also exists between the dorsal plexus and the right coronary cardiac nerve. None of the sympathetic nerve projections, however, inﬂuence an exclusive cardiac territory, although the anterior region of the left ventricle appears to be mainly regulated by nerve ﬁbers from the right sympathetic ganglia.
A number of functional canine heart studies support James et al.’s description (19). Schlock et al. (51) demonstrated how a left stellate ganglion block on canine hearts signiﬁcantly reduced contractility in the posteriobasal myocardium compared to the anterioapical region. Norepinephrine analogue I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), used in in vivo imaging studies on canine hearts, revealed an increased uptake in the anterioapical region following a left stellate ganglion block and an increased uptake in the posterior region following a right stellate ganglion block (9).
The parasympathetic innervation of the heart is provided by efferent paraganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the medulla oblongata, which project axons onto the heart where they synapse with efferent postganglionic parasympathetic neurons that innervate the heart. Despite the existence of an abundant parasympathetic innervation of the atria, intraventricular parasympathetic ganglion cells are sparsely distributed (36). Pace et al. (40) reported that reduced contractility was observed more markedly in the left ventricular base than in the apex by stimulation of the cervical vagosympathetic trunk, indicating less innervation in the apex than in the base of the left ventricle.
Thames et al. (60) found that left ventricular receptors with vagal afferents are located mainly in the inferioposterior region. As these receptors are activated during coronary occlusion and mediate cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses, this may explain why acute inferioposterior myocardial infarction induces a greater number of negative reﬂex responses, such as bradycardia, hypotension and vasodilation, than acute inferior infarction. These functional studies support Randall et al.’s (46) descriptions of the “patterns of sympathetic nerve projections onto the canine heart”.

Heterogeneity of the cardiac autonomic innervation

In summary, sympathetic nerves distributed in the anterior region are most likely to be regulated by the right sympathetic basal ganglia whereas those in the inferioposterior region are most likely to be regulated by the left sympathetic basal ganglia. Furthermore, the inferioposterior region of the heart contains a greater number of ventricular receptors with parasympathetic vagal afferent nerves than the anterior region. However, in summarizing, possible variations between canine and human hearts should not be forgotten.
Heterogeneous norepinephrine content in the heart
Pierpont et al. (41) investigated the myocardial norepinephrine (NE) content of four healthy dogs. The NE concentration was found to be higher in the atria than in the ventricle with NE distribution in the left ventricle demonstrating a gradient from apex to base. No epicardial-to-endocardial gradient was present. NE uptake ratio in the left ventricle, following radiolabeled NE injection revealed a similar heterogeneous pattern. These results suggest that areas of high tissue NE uptake represent regions rich in adrenergic supply and high in adrenergic activity; therefore, the left ventricular base area appears to be more richly innervated than the apical area.
Heterogeneity in normal human heart
Recent studies using I-123 MIBG scintigraphy have demonstrated the heterogeneous sympathetic distribution of the normal heart (14, 47, 62, 33). Previous investigations on uptake rates immediately following I-123 MIBG injection, seem to reﬂect the anatomical distribution of sympathetic nerve endings (7, 45), whereas later (4 hour) imaging reﬂects the functional distribution of the sympathetic system. Furthermore, washout rate from early to late uptake might reﬂect regional sympathetic tone (3, 18, 25, 30). Tsuchimochi et al. (62) used MIBG to investigate delayed uptake in twenty-nine normal human subjects. They found that only in the inferior region did uptake decrease with age and that this was more evident in men. Sakata et al. (47) investigated regional heterogeneity, focusing on regional functional differences, using 315 normal subjects (40 – 79 years old) assessed by the washout rate of I-123 MIBG. They found, in men, that MIBG uptake at late imaging in the inferior region was inversely correlated to age, with a 16 % reduction in uptake in the 80-year-old age group compared to the 40year-old age group. Furthermore in the female groups, MIBG washout rates in each region: anterior, lateral and inferior were also well correlated with age. The authors stated that the age-related inferior MIBG decreased

uptake in men could be explained by impaired re-uptake of norepinephrine. In women, age-related, diffusely enhanced MIBG washout, was believed to be a result of reduced parasympathetic nerve activity. Morozumi et al. (33) reported that inferior MIBG uptake was inversely correlated with the high frequency component, assessed by Holter ECG, as an index of parasympathetic nerve activity and mean R-R interval in resting ECG in normal human subjects. The high parasympathetic activity in patients with low inferior tracer uptake may be caused by the depressor reﬂex mediated by the parasympathetic nerve ﬁbers, secondary to age-induced neuronal depletion as indicated above (60).
I-123 MIBG imaging was used to study cardiac heterogeneous innervation in structurally normal hearts of athletes with sinus bradycardia (12). A severely depressed inferior uptake of MIBG was found compared to controls (44 ± 13% vs. 72 ± 11%, p < 0.01) which may also induce high parasympathetic activity, characterized by sinus bradycardia.
The mechanism of sympathetic cardiac innervation has yet to be clariﬁed but, as shown in Fig. 1, inferior, posterior and apical regions are regulated by the terminal portions of the cardiac sympathetic nerves. Lengthdependent alterations of the sympathetic nerve density might be one possible explanation of the heterogeneity.
Diaphragmatic attenuation of scintigraphic data sometimes plays a role in the heterogeneity of MIBG distribution in the left ventricle upon imaging, in particular in the inferioposterior region. Furthermore, a previous phantom study demonstrated that a high count in the liver may create artifactual defects in the inferioposterior region of the heart in single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging (23). However if age-related lower MIBG uptake rates are considered, these artifacts may contribute less to the heterogeneity of MIBG distribution.
Heterogeneity in arrhythmogenic heart disease
The sympathetic nervous system is known to play an important role in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias (68). Increased levels of catecholamines or cardiac sympathetic overactivity can induce triggered activity, and create spatial dispersion of refractoriness, resulting in a substrate for arrhythmias (2, 44). Calkins et al. (5) studied the sympathetic nervous system using the catecholamine analogue C-11 hydroxyephedrine (HED) and positron emission tomography (PET). They investigated the correlation between scintigraphic evidence of neuronal dysfunction and ventricular refractoriness in infarcted or cardiomyopathic human hearts with ventricular arrhythmia. They found that the effective refractory period in areas of myocardium demonstrating reduced C-11 HED retention was significantly longer

than in areas of myocardium demonstrating normal C-11 HED retention (p < 0.001). This suggests a relationship between abnormal sympathetic innervation and arrhythmogenesis in the structurally abnormal heart. Evidence also exists of heterogeneous innervation without structural abnormality (which is closely linked to fatal ventricular arrhythmias). Dae et al. (8) investigated cardiac sympathetic denervation using German shepherd dogs, with inherited spontaneous cardiac arrhythmias and associated sudden death, as a model of arrhythmogenic heart without structural abnormality. Upon I-123 MIBG imaging, they found 35 ± 16.5% of the left ventricle was denervated in the group of dogs with episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 12.0 ± 5.6% in groups without VT. Control dogs demonstrated signiﬁcantly less denervation (4.0 ± 1.1%) than either of these two study groups. These ﬁndings suggest that the extent of heterogeneous innervation is related to the incidence of fatal arrhythmic episodes.
Cardiac sympathetic heterogeneity is also observed in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is characterized by recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which frequently originated from the right ventricular outﬂow or inﬂow tract. The structural abnormality was also characterized by ﬁbrolipomatous inﬁltration with degeneration of right ventricular myocardium that progress from the epicardium toward the endocardium, but left ventricular involvement is frequently observed. Wichter et al. (65) suggested that 40 of 48 ARVC patients (80%) demonstrated regional reductions or defects of I-123 MIBG uptake. The reduced tracer uptake was commonly involved in the basal posteroseptal region of the left ventricle, which was adjacent to the interventricular septum. The region is a common morphological substrate that is provided by the progressive degeneration of myocytes starting in the subepicardium and subsequent inﬁltration of fatty and ﬁbrous tissue with interspersed surviving myocardial ﬁbers.
Schaeffer et al. (50) reported on I-123 MIBG scintigraphy in patients with idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (ILVT), idiopathic ventricular ﬁbrillation (IVF) and right ventricular outﬂow tract tachycardia (RVOVT). IVF and RVO-VT demonstrated a regional reduction in MIBG uptake, whereas ILVT patients demonstrated no such regional difference in MIBG uptake. The results of this study can be explained by the close relationship between the extent of heterogeneous innervation and the arrhythmic episodes.
It has been hypothesized that the long QT syndrome, which results in an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, is the result of an imbalance of sympathetic cardiac innervation (28, 55, 56). However, recent studies using I-123 MIBG and C-11 HED, controversially suggest that heterogeneous sympathetic cardiac nervous function and distribution do not exist in long QT syndrome

(6, 15, 32, 34). Furthermore, genetic analysis demonstrates that ion channel dysfunction is the primary defect in many forms of long QT syndrome which in turn triggers ventricular arrhythmia (43).
Brugada syndrome is characterized as a syndrome of right bundle branch block, right precordial ST-segment elevation and sudden death or syncope due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ﬁbrillation. Kasanuki et al. (21) found that increased vagal tone appears to be related to the initiation of ventricular ﬁbrillation in patients without evidence of heart disease. In Brugada syndrome, studies using I-123 MIBG have demonstrated a variety of findings: almost normal regional uptake (29), inferioposterior reduced uptake (1, 37) and normal regional uptake with reduced global washout in the left ventricle (24). In view of these discrepant ﬁndings, the existence of sympathetic heterogeneous innervation in this disease is questioned.
Heterogeneity in other pathological conditions
Diseased human hearts, examined with I-123 MIBG or C11 HED, were frequently found to have heterogeneous sympathetic innervation. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is frequently associated with regional neuronal dysfunction rather than with a perfusion abnormality (30). In DCM patients, the inferioposterior region is more commonly affected by neuronal dysfunction (67), and the heterogeneous innervation is linked to the severity or prognosis of the condition (16, 42, 64). Elevated plasma catecholamine levels result in competitive inhibition of presynaptic reuptake with global and/or regional reduction of the tracer uptake. This mechanism may partly explain the ﬁndings of impaired autonomic function in DCM patients.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is reported to involve sympathetic dysinnervation (27, 49). Studies revealed a global reduction in neuronal uptake of C-11 HED (49) and F-18 fluorodopamine (F-18 FDA) (27), which is also a tracer of catecholamines analogous to C-11 HED, in HCM patients compared to controls. In particular, Li et al. (27) focused on regional heterogeneity of sympathetic neuronal uptake in HCM, indicating that F-18 FDA retention corrected by perfusion was decreased in hypertrophied myocardial regions, but not in non-hypertrophied regions compared to myocardium in normal controls.
Systemic autonomic diseases frequently influence cardiac neuronal function (20, 39, 48). In particular, diabetes mellitus is often associated with autonomic neuropathy resulting in increased morbidity and mortality (13). Cardiac sympathetic neuronal dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus has been found using the

Heterogeneity of the cardiac autonomic innervation

Fig. 2 PET images of the left ventricle in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Perfusion images using N-13 ammonia (top panels) are normal, whereas C-11 hydroxyephedrine (HED) retention is preserved only at the proximal segments of the left ventricle. The mismatch of perfusion and HED uptake identifies the area of sympathetic innervation.
above imaging methods (17, 26, 52, 63) even following negative clinical testing of the autonomic nervous system (52, 63). The imaging studies demonstrated a reduction in tracer uptake in the inferior wall of the left ventricle gradually spreading to adjacent segments. The extent of the reduced uptake was related to the severity of autonomic dysfunction as measured by conventional markers (17, 52).

Stevens et al. (57) found, using C-11 HED PET, cardiac sympathetic denervation in the distal (apical) segments and inferioposterior regions of patients with diabetic neuropathy. In their study, rest myocardial blood ﬂow in the distal denervated segments was greater in subjects with diabetic neuropathy than in diabetic subjects without neuropathy. Although the effects of sympathetic denervation on myocardial blood ﬂow are not well understood, this ﬁnding may be explained by the fact that denervation induces myocardial capillary angiogenesis as found previously (61). Figure 2 shows an example of a C11 HED PET image in a diabetic patient.
Parkinson’s disease commonly presents with disturbances in autonomic function. In the heart, heterogeneous patterns of neuronal abnormalities, similar to those found in diabetes mellitus, have been reported (20). However the damage is actually heterogeneous and it is believed that this is because sympathetic nerves in the inferioposterior region are more easily damaged then elsewhere. In conditions such as aortic valve regurgitation, mitral valve regurgitation or aortic valve stenosis where pressure or volume overload of the heart occurs, abnormal heterogeneous sympathetic innervation has been found (45, 58). This innervation pattern is, once again, similar to that found in diabetes mellitus where I-123 MIBG imaging demonstrated a lower tracer uptake in the inferioposterior region: the extent of reduced uptake being correlated with the severity of disease (59).

Heterogeneous reinnervation following cardiac transplantation

Fig. 3 PET images of the left ventricle in a patient 8 years after cardiac transplantation. Perfusion images (left) show homogeneous blood flow. C-11 HED images (right) indicate tracer retention in the anterior aspects of the left ventricle increasing from middle towards the base of the ventricle.

As cardiac sympathetic ﬁbers are severed during surgery, transplanted human hearts have demonstrated no localization of I-123 MIBG uptake shortly after transplantation (4, 7, 31, 54). However a number of studies report partial cardiac reinnervation at later time points after transplantation (4, 10, 11, 53). Using I-123 MIBG or C-11 HED, evidence was found of reinnervation primarily in the basal anterioseptal region and to a lesser degree in the inferioposterior and apical regions (4, 31, 53). Figure 3 shows an example of scintigraphic ﬁndings using C-11 HED PET.
The mid-ventricular region of the myocardium typically demonstrates less reinnervation than the basal region. Neurohormonal studies by Kaye et al. (22) have conﬁrmed this observation. In their 1977 study on canine hearts, they found that norepinephrine concentrations recovered ﬁrst in the left and right atrium followed by the basal left ventricular area; ﬁnally recovery was noted in the apical region two years after denervation. The ﬁndings of heterogeneous reinnervation can partly be explained by the fact that sympathetic neurons travel

along arterial structures, therefore, if reinnervation occurs, basal regions will be reached ﬁrst by the newly grown ﬁbers.
Conclusion
New imaging techniques, using tracer approaches, can visualize cardiac sympathetic innervation. Heterogeneity of tracer distribution, as a marker of variability in neuronal density and function, has been described in normal as well as diseased heart. The inferioposterior region

shows typically less sympathetic innervation than the anterior region. In addition, neuropathic processes appear to commence in inferio-apical regions extending towards the base of the heart. Arrhythmogeneity has been related to the heterogeneous innervation of the heart and heterogeneous tracer uptake can be found in patients with arrhythmia. In dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced MIBG uptake indicates a poor prognosis which allows risk stratiﬁcation for patients with heart failure to be calculated. Tracer approaches are uniquely suited to identify regionally altered innervation and provide tools for linking information on cardiac autonomic innervation with other clinical aspects.
