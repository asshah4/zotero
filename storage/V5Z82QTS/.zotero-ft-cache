Abstract 
The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) responses to a combat stress-related auditory stimulus was examined in Vietnam veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Based on prior data in healthy subjects, we hypothesized that the medial prefrontal cortex may be involved in the processing of stress responses. Twelve male veterans diagnosed with PTSD, 11 age-matched, combat-exposed subjects without PTSD, and 12 healthy control subjects were studied with single-photon emission tomography and the blood flow tracer [ 99 m Tc]-HMPAO. Subjects were studied twice, while listening to combat sounds or white noise. Significant increases in the blood flow to the medial prefrontal cortex were observed in PTSD patients, but not in the control groups, which correlated at trend levels with psychophysical measures of stress response. These data support the involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex in the pathophysiology of PTSD, possibly mediating some of its symptoms.

Abstract 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a potential consequence of being exposed to or witnessing an event provoking fear, helplessness, or horror. It is characterized by several debilitating symptoms including persistent hyperarousal, unwanted memories and thought intrusions, and hyperavoidance of stimuli or situations associated with the original trauma. The neurobiological mediators of these symptoms, however, still require elucidation, and animal models are particularly well suited for investigation of these mechanisms. Although the behavioral literature contains a large number of models that involve exposing animals to intense stressors, only a few of these are able to reproduce the biological and behavioral features of PTSD characteristic of a pathophysiological stress response. Among these are models involving single episodes of inescapable shock, which produce several bio-behavioral effects characteristic of PTSD, including opioid-mediated analgesia, noradrenergic sensitization as well as fear-conditioning effects. Single prolonged stress, involving the sequential exposure of rats to restraint, forced swim, and ether anesthesia, is able to produce an enhanced negative feedback of the HPA axis, as observed in PTSD patients, as well as a sustained exaggeration of the acoustic startle response. Predator exposure models, which invoke a significant threat of injury or death to particular animals, are effective in producing behavioral changes potentially analogous to hyperarousal symptoms, as well as changes in amygdala sensitization and long-term potentiation. In addition to these PTSD-specific models, several putative models, including single episodes of restraint/immobilization, forced swim, or early-life maternal separation, show promise as potential PTSD models, but require further validation and characterization before they might be considered specific to this disorder. Given the complexity of PTSD, both in terms of causal factors and symptoms, it is becoming apparent that multiple, independent physiological pathways might mediate this disorder. Future research may, therefore, wish to focus on endophenotypic models, which attend to one specific physiological pathway or neurobiological system, rather than attempt to reproduce the broad range of PTSD symptomatology. Combining information from numerous such models may prove a more efficient strategy.

Abstract 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with long-term changes in neurobiology. Brain areas involved in the stress response include the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Neurohormonal systems that act on the brain areas to modulate PTSD symptoms and memory include glucocorticoids and norepinephrine. Dysfunction of these brain areas is responsible for the symptoms of PTSD. Brain imaging studies show that PTSD patients have increased amygdala reactivity during fear acquisition. Other studies show smaller hippocampal volume. A failure of medial prefrontal/anterior cingulate activation with re-experiencing of the trauma is hypothesized to represent a neural correlate of the failure of extinction seen in PTSD. The brain has the capacity for plasticity in the aftermath of traumatic stress. Antidepressant treatments and changes in environment can reverse the effects of stress on hippocampal neurogenesis, and humans with PTSD showed increased hippocampal volume with both paroxetine and phenytoin.

Abstract 
Background 
Animal studies have shown that early stressors result in lasting changes in structure and function of brain areas involved in memory, including hippocampus and frontal cortex. Patients with childhood abuse–related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have alterations in both declarative and nondeclarative memory function, and imaging studies in PTSD have demonstrated changes in function during stimulation of trauma-specific memories in hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate. The purpose of this study was to assess neural correlates of emotionally valenced declarative memory in women with early childhood sexual abuse and PTSD. 
Methods 
 
Women with early childhood sexual abuse–related PTSD ( n = 10) and women without abuse or PTSD ( n = 11) underwent positron emission tomographic (PET) measurement of cerebral blood flow during a control condition and during retrieval of neutral (e.g., “metal-iron”) and emotionally valenced (e.g., “rape-mutilate”) word pairs. 
Results 
 
During retrieval of emotionally valenced word pairs, PTSD patients showed greater decreases in blood flow in an extensive area, which included orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann’s areas 25, 32, 9), left hippocampus, and fusiform gyrus/inferior temporal gyrus, with increased activation in posterior cingulate, left inferior parietal cortex, left middle frontal gyrus, and visual association and motor cortex. There were no differences in patterns of brain activation during retrieval of neutral word pairs between patients and control subjects. 
Conclusions 
 
These findings are consistent with dysfunction of specific brain areas involved in memory and emotion in PTSD. Regions implicated in this study of emotionally valenced declarative memory are similar to those from prior imaging studies in PTSD using trauma-specific stimuli for symptom provocation, adding further supportive evidence for a dysfunctional network of brain areas involved in memory, including hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate, in PTSD.
