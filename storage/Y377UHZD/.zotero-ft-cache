"Color Vectorcardiogram" Recorded
with a Specially Designed Apparatus for
Spatial Representation By Coloring
By SHINJI KINosHITA, M.D., AND TADAsm KOBAYASH, M.D.
SUMMARY Using a vectorcardiogram only in the horizontal plane, spots of the vector loop were
colored according to a specially designed apparatus, so that changes in height of the spots could be indicated by differences in those colors. Consequently, the spatial vectorcardiogram was represented by a single, colored graph, i.e. a "color vectorcardiogram." By the use of this graph, an attempt was made to facilitate the understanding of vectorcardiography for common clinicians. The colors corresponding to the heights of the deflections in the Y axis were chosen as follows: in a level of the origin or zero point of the vector loop, yellow; above the origin, reddish colors; and below the origin, bluish colors.

IT IS THE primary purpose of vectorcardiography for all the electrocardiographic
leads recorded in a person to be readily appreciated as a single spatial vectorcardiogram. According to the vectorcardiography as now practiced, however, the record in a person consists of three-plane vectorcardiograms. We think this may explain why vectorcardiography is difficult for some clinicians to understand. Although there have been several attempts to visualize directly the spatial vectorcardiogram,l 2 it seems to us that these cannot solve this problem because of difficulty in keeping a graphic record.
In the present study, a vector loop was observed only in the horizontal plane. By means of a specially designed apparatus for coloring of spots of the vector loop, variations

in height (that is, the degree of superior and inferior deviations of the spots) were indi-
cated by differences in those colors. The
spatial vectoreardiogram, accordingly, was
represented by a single, colored plane vector-
cardiogram. By employing this colored graph (the "color vectorcardiogram"), an attempt
was made to clarify vectorcardiography for
clinicians.
Method
An apparatus for recording the "color vectorcardiogram" was specially designed by us. A detailed method for using this apparatus was reported in our previous paper.3 An outline of the apparatus is illustrated in figures 1 and 2.
At first, by monochromatic light spots, a vector loop of the horizontal plane was described on a fluorescent screen of the oscilloscope, as shown in figure 1. Then, using a lens, the images of these light spots were focused on a filter for coloring. Finally, the spots of the vector loop were photographed through this filter. Thus, a colored graph, i.e. a "color vectorcardiogram," was recorded. Using a galvanometer connected to both leads of the X and Y axes, as shown in figure 2, the position of the filter was varied from instant to instant so as to change the color of the spot only corresponding to the voltage of the deflection in the Y axis.

Schematic representation of the apparatus for record-
ing the "color vectorcardiogram."1 The type of cathode-ray tube is 3KP4 or 3KP7. The lens of 130-mm focus is placed in the middle between the fluorescent screen and the filter for coloring. The distance from the screen to the filter (520 mm) is equal to four times the focal length of the lens. The image of the vector lZp on the filter, accordingly, is the same in length as the
vector loop on the fluorescent screen. The filter is 34
mm in width and 23 mm in height. Colors, each of which is 2 mm in width, are arranged side by side on
the filter.

Vectorcardiography, though giving us better information in many respects, is used far less commonly than ordinary electrocardiography. We think this may be due to the fact
that the use of three-plane vectorcardiograms, as now practiced, makes it difficult to
understand this method. In this study, spots of the vector loop in the horizontal plane were colored so that changes in height of the spots
might be shown. Consequently, the spatial
vctorcdigram wa reprsented byapsn
colored graph. By the use of this graph, an
attempt was made to facilitate the vectorcardiographic interpretation for clinicians.
Pre-Amplif ier

The colors corresponding to the heights of the deflections in the Y axis were chosen usually as shown in figure 3: in a level of the origin or zero point of the vector loop, yellow; above the origin,
0.8 and 0.4 mv, red and orange, respectively; and
below the origin, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 mv,
yellow-green, green, green-blue, and blue, respectively. Wherever the deflection in the Y axis was higher than 1.2 mv above the origin, white was
chosen; and wherever deeper than 2.0 my below the origin, blue-purple.

It is known that, when the vectorcardiogram is observed in a single plane, the greatest accuracy in interpretation is attained by using the horizontal plane.4 In order to obtain the "color vectorcardiogram," therefore, a vector loop in the horizontal plane was usually employed. In cases in which the amplitude of the deflection in the Y axis was unusually large or unusually small, the sensibility to the voltage in the Y axis was respectively decreased or increased to such an extent that differences in color of the spots could be readily appreciated.
We think that the use of these procedures, as compared with the use of three-plane vectorcardiograms, can remove the abovementioned complication in the graphic inter-
