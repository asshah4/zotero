Beat-to-Beat Variations of Heart Rate Reflect Modulation of Cardiac Autonomic Outflow
J. Philip Saul

What is most intriguing about heart rate (HR) variability is that there is so much of it. HR is constantly responding both rapidly and slowly to various physiological perturbations. We now understand that the
frequency and amplitude of these HR fluctuations are indicative of the autonomic control systems underlying the response.

Introduction

Since the 193Os, the control of

physiological systems has been un-

derstood in terms of homeostasis, a

process by which system variables

are maintained within a relatively

narrow range by the system control

elements, For the intact cardiovas-

cular system, feedback and control

mechanisms are particularly effi-

cient at maintaining the mean val-

ues of arterial blood pressure (ABP)

and central venous volume within a

narrow range by constant regulation

of heart rate (HR) and vascular tone.

Thus quantifying changes in the

mean value of ABP or HR may not

unveil substantial responses in the

underlying control systems during

periods of hemodynamic stress.

Alternatively,

spontaneous fluc-

tuations of HR and ABP reflect the

interaction between ongoing pertur-

bations to the cardiovascular system

and the response of its regulatory

mechanisms. Analysis of beat-to-

beat variability of HR and ABP can

provide specific quantitative infor-

mation about modulation of cardiac

vagal, cardiac sympathetic, and pe-

ripheral sympathetic nervous activ-

ity (1, 8, 9, 13). Although HR and

Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

ABP fluctuations at the respiratory frequency and at lower frequencies (CO.15 Hz, period >6 s) were recognized well before the 20th century, quantitative assessment of the characteristics and significance of these fluctuations has been much more recent. The critical importance of normal HR variability was first elucidated in observations of fetal HR, where it became clear that absence of the normal beat-to-beat variability of HR is indicative of abnormal central nervous modulation of HR and in indication for emergency Caeserian section.
In the early 1970s power spectral analysis was first employed to quantify spontaneous HR variability in normal humans (5). These investigators described three typical peaks in the HR power spectrum (Fig. 1): Z) a peak at the respiratory frequency corresponding to respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), 2) a peak centered near 0.1 Hz considered important in ABP control, and 3) a peak at 0.04 Hz thought to be related to peripheral vasomotor regulation. Further work has shown that although there is a tendency for HR fluctuations to occur in the three described frequency ranges, the frequency as well as the amplitude of the spectral peaks is constantly changing in response to various hemodynamic perturbations, such that over the course of an entire day, few preferential frequencies stand out in normal individuals (12).

Mediators of the fluctuations
Experiments using pharmacologic blockade of the sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs to the sinoatrial (SA) node have demonstrated that virtually all HR fluctuations >0.03 Hz are caused by changing levels of the efferent activity of these inputs and have shown that each of the autonomic branches mediate HR fluctuations in different frequency bands (1, 8, 9). Specifically, HR fluctuations at frequencies >0.15 Hz are mediated solely by changing levels of vagal activity, whereas fluctuations co.15 Hz can be mediated by changing levels of both cardiac vagal and sympathetic activity. HR fluctuations co.03 Hz (period of 50 s) may be also mediated by changing plasma levels of neurohormones. Recently, Berger et al. (2), using a contemporary systems analysis technique to study the canine atria1 rate response to induced broad-band fluctuations of vagal and sympathetic firing frequency, directly confirmed the differential response of HR to fluctuations of the activity of the two autonomic branches. In addition, their findings allowed for a complete and precise description of the response characteristics of HR to modulation of these inputs as a function of frequency (i.e., the frequency response or transfer function) and led to formulation of a model for neural control of HR (Fig. 23).
In this model, the HR response to modulation of sympathetic neural activity is characterized by a fixed time delay and a marked roll-off in gain at frequencies >O.l Hz (only low frequencies are fully transmitted), whereas parasympathetic HR control is characterized by a rapid broad-band response that is inverted, since increasing vagal activity leads to a decrease in HR (180" phase shift). In engineering terms, the responses have the gain and phase characteristics of low-pass filters such that the sympathetic filter has a much lower cutoff frequency than that of the parasympathetic filter. Although poorly understood, the slower response of HR to modulation of sympathetic activity seems to lie at the level of neurotransmitter ki-

respiratory

and

heart rate (HR) time series and power spec-

tra from 1 normal individual who is standing.

Respiratory rate is voluntarily controlled with

a metronome

at 12 breaths/min

or 0.2 Hz.

Thus respiratory

signal has virtually all its

energy near 0.2 Hz, as displayed in the

power spectrum. Conversely,

HR signal is

more complicated.

HR spectrum clearly di-

vides energy or variance in signal into the 3

typical frequency bands: 1) respiratory fre-

quency of 0.2 Hz (RSA), 2) near 0.1 Hz (so-

called 10-s rhythm), and 3) at a very low

frequency centered about 0.02 Hz (period of

-50 s). Three peaks are not always seen,

and in fact, the frequency and amplitude of

these peaks may vary dramatically

within

an individual depending on autonomic state

and activity level, Peaks ~0.15 Hz are due

only to modulation of vagal activity, while

peaks CO. 15 Hz may be result of modulation

of both cardiac sympathetic

and vagal ac-

tivity,

netics and receptor activation, as indicated in Fig. 2B. The model also suggests that the rate responses to the two autonomic inputs add linearly to produce the final HR, a situation known to be unrealistic for large fluctuations but which may apply when only small perturbations about the mean operating point are considered.
The differential frequency response of HR to modulation of cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent activity is the critical link for using spectral measures of HR variability to probe autonomic control of the heart. The idea is that bY unders tandin g the tr ansfer charact eristics of the neural control system and measuri ng the system output HR, one can estimate the characteristics of the autonomic inputs. This notion is certainly true at frequencies >0.15 Hz where only vagal modulation affects HR, but it is obviously more suspect at lower frequencies where both autonomic branches have an effect. Of course,

if the effects of one or the other autonomic inputs are absent, then the short-term HR fluctuations that remain are caused primarily by the other autonomic branch.

Origin of the fluctuations

Factors that modulate the cardiac

autonomic inputs (Fig. 2A) obviously

play a dominant role in HR control,

but it must be remembered that the

final common pathway for their ef-

fect on HR is primarily the cardiac

vagal and sympathetic efferents.

Consequently, their effect may be

ultimately determined by the auto-

nomic response characteristics dis-

cussed above (i.e., the vagal and

sympathetic

filters). Figure 2A

shows diagrammatically how cen-

tral command, respiration, arterial

baroreflexes, and cardiopulmonary

reflexes may all modulate cardiac

autonomic activity and subse-

quently HR. Central command can

obviously be modulated at virtually

any frequency and seems to play an

important role in many situations,

including emotional responses and

the initial responses to exercise;

however, because central command

is difficult both to measure and con-

trol, little emphasis will be placed

on it in this discussion.

Respiratory frequencies (>O. 15

Hz). In practice respiratory activity

seems to be the only significant

physiological noise source >0.15 Hz.

In addition, respiratory activity only

rarely occurs at frequencies CO.15

Hz (9 breaths/min). If one combines

these observations with the knowl-

edge that the vagus is the only auto-

nomic input capable of modulating

HR at frequencies >O.l5 Hz, it

quickly becomes obvious that higher

frequency fluctuations of HR specif-

ically reflect respiratory modulation

of cardiac vagal activity. Of course,

as multiple investigators

have

shown, respiration mediates its ef-

fect on vagal activity and HR

through a number of mechanisms,

which include a direct central action

on vagal efferents and mechanical

influences on the arterial and car-

diopulmonary baroreflexes. It is im-

portant to note that respiration also

modulates sympathetic efferent ac-

tivity, but at typical respiratory fre-

quencies (>0.15 Hz) the SA node re-

sponse to that activity is simply too

slow to significantly modulate HR.

However, if respiratory activity does

occur at lower frequencies, HR will

be modulated through the effects of

respiration on both sympathetic and

vagal activity.

Midfrequencies (0.03-O. 15 Hz). HR

and ABP fluctuations at and below

this frequency range are referred to

variably as Mayer waves. In contrast

to the situation at higher frequen-

cies, at lower frequencies co.15 Hz,

the situation is much more complex.

Not only are both sympathetic and

vagal activity capable of modulat-

ing HR, but spontaneous feedback

rhythms seem to occur, centered at

frequencies between 0.05 and 0.1 Hz

(periods 10-20 s). Both experimental

and computer modeling results sup-

port the notion that baroreflex feed-

back is necessary for these rhythms.

Based on these studies one might

speculate that the frequency and

amplitude of the HR oscillations de-

pend on the relative gains of the

elements that modulate cardiac va-

gal, cardiac sympathetic, and pe-

ripheral sympathetic efferent activ-

ity. For instance, a relatively larger

vagal influence should increase the

oscillatory frequency toward 0.1 Hz

because of the rapid rate response to

vagal stimuli and, conversely, a

larger sympathetic influence should

reduce the frequency toward 0.05 Hz

because of the slower sympathetic

response.

Very low frequencies (~0.03 Hz).

HR and ABP fluctuations centered at

lower frequencies ~0.05 Hz have

been observed and studied in a va-

riety of circumstances. It is clear that

multiple variables have a physiolog-

ical influence on these very-low-fre-

quency fluctuations, including blood

volume status, carotid artery occlu-

sion, cardiac pump competence, and

low-frequency oscillations of respi-

ratory tidal volume (periodic or

Cheyne-Stokes-like

breathing) (15).

In some studies very-low-frequency

HR fluctuations have been found to

be critically dependent on ABP fluc-

tuations at the same frequency, sug-

gesting a role for arterial barore-

flexes, whereas in others HR and

sympathetic nerve oscillations have

continued despite elimination of the

ABP fluctuation, suggesting the ar-

terial baroreflex is not always nec-

essary to sustain these oscillations

Interpretation of HR spectra
It is important to realize that shortterm HR fluctuations are the direct result of the heart’s response to

changing levels or modulation of cardiac autonomic activity and are not necessarily related to the mean firing rates of the vagal and sympathetic fibers. Although, in general,

either mean vagal or sympathetic activity to be elevated without the presence of significant modulation, or for modulation to occur without a significant response from the heart (e.g., saturation). Thus it is most appropriate to interpret HR spectral peaks as quantifiers of autonomic responsiveness rather than autonomic “tone.” This issue is extremely important in the interpretation of lowfrequency fluctuations,

Clinical observations

Analyses of spontaneous fluctua-

tions of HR and ABP have proven

useful in understanding cardiovas-

cular regulation in normal adults (8,

9) and adults with congestive heart

failure (CHF) (13), diabetes (3, hy-

pertension (7), and cardiac trans-

plants (11). In fact, changes in HR

variability patterns have been indic-

ative of graft rejection in the trans-

planted heart (ll), may be predictive

of sudden cardiac death after myo-

cardial infarction (6), and seem to

predict impending cardiovascular

collapse in hospitalized infants who

have otherwise appeared stable (4).

Congestive heart failure. As ex-

emplified in Fig. 33, heart rate spec-

tral power is reduced at all frequen-

cies in patients with chronic CHF

but is virtually absent at frequencies

~0.04 Hz. Power at frequencies

co.04 Hz seems to be relatively pre-

served due to a discrete 60- to 80-s

(-0.15 Hz) oscillation of HR (Fig. 33)

that is associated with a similar pat-

tern in respiratory activity. The low-

frequency respiratory activity re-

sembles Cheyne-Stokes respiration

in some patients but in most patients

falls within the range of normal.

Thus, in normal subjects, HR re-

sponds to low- and high-frequency

physiological perturbations, whereas

in patients with CHF, HR responds

only to very-low-frequency

pertur-

bations (~0.04 Hz). The findings first

demonstrate a marked derangement

of HR modulation in patients with

severe CHF. In addition, the model

proposed in Fig. 2 can be used to

suggest that the frequency charac-

teristics of HR fluctuations in these

patients are consistent with abnor-

mal baroreflex responsiveness to

physiological stimuli and that there

is diminished vagal, but preserved

sympathetic modulation of HR (13).

spectra from a normal

subject (A) and patients with CHF (B), diabetes (C and D), and cardiac transplants (Eand F).

Although range of heart rates in beats/min (bpm) on y-axis is different for subjects A-C than

for subjects D-F, scale of 40 bpm is the same for all tracings, Note that spectral density scale

is the same in tracings A-D (O-200 bpm2/Hz) for comparison with data from the normal subject

but is changed to 0 to 30 bpm3/Hz for the 2 transplant subjects to better demonstrate

the

unusual finding of low amplitude but frequency-specific

HR fluctuations in trace (F). Also note

similarities between data for the diabetic subject with severe neuropathy

and the “typical”

transplant subject.

Diabetes. In diabetic subjects, an association has been found between the presence and degree of peripheral neuropathy, as judged by standard neurologic testing, and cardiac autonomic neuropathy, as judged by HR spectral power (Fig. 3, C and D). Previous investigators using both HR variability and other autonomic tests have debated over the time course of sympathetic vs. parasympathetic neuropathy (3). In agreement with both schools of thought, recent unpublished data from our laboratory suggest that some diabetics have a predominant vagal neuropathy, whereas in others the defect is primarily sympathetic.
Transplantation. As expected, denervation of the donor heart after cardiac transplantation usually leads to virtual absence of all shortterm (Fig. 3E) but not long-term heart rate variability. Two possible

exceptions to this situation have been found. Sands et al. (11) recently reported a broad-band (in frequency) increase in HR spectral power that tracked biopsy-proven rejection in some transplant recipients. They suggested that the findings were due to involvement of the SA node or supraventricular conduction system in the rejection process, which then led to erratic beatto-beat variation in R-wave position, They also speculated that HR spectral analysis may serve as a noninvasive indicator of rejection in selected patients. Prospective studies were proposed. The second exception is shown in Fig. SF, which demonstrates recurrence of discrete spectral peaks in a patient who is -36 mo posttransplantation. Although the peaks are of low amplitude, their frequency characteristics strongly suggest the presence of sym-

pathetic neural control of HR in this patient. Because the patient had both donor and recipient P waves that were uncoupled from each other on the surface electrocardiogram, the findings further suggest sympathetic reinnervation of the donor sinus node, a previously undescribed result in humans.
These analyses of HR and ABP variability have already provided both clinically useful information and important insights into the mechanisms involved in hemodynamic regulation; however, the approach has substantial limitations. Interpretations of these data have been restricted both by an inability to characterize the underlying autonomic control mechanisms when only system outputs such as HR are measured and by the limited number of oscillatory frequencies that occur spontaneously. The situation is analogous to trying to characterize the human ear by only knowing what an individual heard without a priori information about the frequency and amplitude of the actual auditory stimuli and also without auditory stimuli at a broad range of frequencies. The characterization would be incomplete at best. To solve these problems, one would like to stimulate the system’s inputs (e.g., respiration, baroreceptors) at a broad range of frequencies and gauge the system’s frequency response [just as is done for hearing with an audiogram and as Berger et al. (2) did for the SA node]. This determination can be realized by either stimulating at a large number of frequencies individually or by attempting to input a broad band or “whitened” signal that contains all frequencies simultaneously. The first of these approaches is somewhat bulky and time consuming but has been used in evaluating a number of physiological systems in past studies. The second approach is used commonly to assess physical systems but has been employed only rarely in the evaluation of physiological systems.
We have recently shown that the accuracy and sensitivity of variability measurements in assessing autonomic modulation of HR can be enhanced by accounting for the amplitude of an input to HR control, respiration, and by standardizing the frequency content of that input between individuals.

calibrated respiratory activity to probe autonomic HR control.

Although between

mean respiratory rate is 12 breaths/min, interval between breaths varies randomly
1 and 15 s, as shown for 1 subject in A. HR response is similarly erratic (B) so that

variance of both HR and respiratory signals is spread out over a range of frequencies from 0 to

0.5 Hz (C and D), This allows for sufficient excitation energy to determine the frequency

response of HR to respiratory activity over entire frequency range. Transfer function magni-

tudes and phases are averages from 14 subjects, 7 in supine position after propranolol

(pure

vagal HR control) and 7 in upright position after atropine (pure sympathetic

HR control).

Transfer functions have gain and phase characteristics

determined

primarily

by SA node

responses to modulation

of autonomic activity (i.e., vagal response is broad band with

minimal phase delay; sympathetic response has significant magnitude at only lower frequen-

cies and has a phase delay). Above OS25 Hz, sympathetic data are unreliable because of low

coherence.

to calibrated respiratory activity was determined during 6-min periods in which the respiratory rate was voluntarily controlled in a predetermined but erratic fashion (Fig. 4, AD). Thus respiration served as a frequency probe of autonomic control. Selective autonomic blockade, with either atropine or propra nolol, and changes in posture were used to dissect the sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions. The gain and phase of the frequency-response functions describe how the autonomic nervous system responds to a stimulus, in this case respiration, as a function of frequency.- We found that the sympathetic (standing + atropine) response is characterized by markedly reduced gain >O.l Hz and a phase delay, whereas vagal (supine- + propra nolol) modulation of HR is characterized by higher gain at all frequencies and no phase delay (Fig. 4, E and F). Because modulation of both cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity occurs with respiration, the data provide the basis - for noninvasively “fingerprinting” the sympathetic and vagal components of cardiac control in individual patients (14).
Conclu sion
The differential frequency response of the sinus node to modula-

tion of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity underlies the value of quantitative HR analysis. Although power spectral analysis of HR has proven to be a useful noninvasive technique for understanding both normal and abnormal cardiovascular regulation in humans, analysis of cardiorespiratory fluctuations is probably most informative when system outputs such as HR can be quantitatively related to inputs such as respiration. Future work should be directed toward similar analyses of the more complicated closed-loop interactions between HR and ABP.
