ABSTRACT Background and aim Chronic HCV infection is associated with several extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs). Data on the effect of sustained virological response (SVR) on the risk of EHMs are limited. Methods  We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data of patients from the US Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry who had a positive HCV RNA test (10/1999-08/2009). Patients receiving interferon-based antiviral therapy (AVT) were identified. SVR was defined as negative HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after end of AVT. Risks of eight incident EHMs were evaluated in Cox regression models. Results  Of the 160 875 HCV-infected veterans, 31 143 (19.4%) received AVT, of whom 10 575 (33.9%) experienced SVR. EHM risk was reduced in the SVR group compared with untreated patients for mixed cryoglobulinaemia (adjusted HR (aHR)=0.61; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94), glomerulonephritis (aHR=0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) (aHR=0.41; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.83), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) (aHR=0.64; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.95), diabetes (aHR=0.82; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.88) and stroke (aHR=0.84; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94), but not for lichen planus (aHR=1.11; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.56) or coronary heart disease (aHR=1.12; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.56). Risk reductions were also observed when patients with SVR were compared with treated patients without SVR for mixed cryoglobulinaemia, glomerulonephritis, PCT and diabetes. Significant reductions in the magnitude of aHRs towards the null with increasing time to initiation of AVT after HCV diagnosis were observed for glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke. Conclusions Risks of several EHMs of HCV infection are reduced after AVT with SVR. However, early initiation of AVT may be required to reduce the risk of glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke.

Introduction HCV infection is a global public health issue and approximately 185 million individuals around the world are estimated to be infected with the virus.1 HCV infection leads to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is the leading reason for liver transplantation in the USA.2 Chronic HCV infection is also associated with several extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs), including essential mixed cryoglobulinaemia, some subtypes of B cell

Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject? ►► Chronic HCV infection is associated with
several extrahepatic manifestations that affect various systems of the human body. ►► Antiviral therapy with attainment of sustained virological response (SVR), which is considered to be virological cure, has several hepatic benefits such as normalisation of liver enzymes, halting the progression of liver disease and reduction in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. ►► However, data on the effect of attaining SVR on the risk of extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection are limited.
What are the new findings? ►► Compared with HCV-infected individuals who
did not receive treatment, SVR attainment was associated with a reduced risk of mixed cryoglobulinaemia, glomerulonephritis, porphyria cutanea tarda, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diabetes mellitus and stroke, but not lichen planus or coronary heart disease. ►► Risk reductions were also observed when patients with SVR were compared with treated patients without SVR for mixed cryoglobulinaemia, glomerulonephritis, porphyria cutanea tarda and diabetes.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? ►► With the introduction and increased use of
direct-acting antivirals that have much better efficacy than interferon-containing regimens, we expect a reduction in the risk of some extrahepatic manifestations of chronic HCV infection. ►► Extrahepatic benefits of SVR attainment should be included in the cost-benefit analyses of new antiviral drugs for HCV infection.
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and lichen planus.3–5 Furthermore, there is consistent epidemiological evidence supporting the association of chronic HCV infection with type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and stroke.6–14

Antiviral therapy (AVT) for HCV infection along with attainment of sustained virological response (SVR)—defined as undetectable viral load at least 12 weeks after treatment completion15—normalises liver enzymes, halts the progression of liver disease and reduces the risk of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma.16–19 SVR with interferon-based AVT leads to significant reduction in the all-cause and liver-related mortality in infected individuals.18 20 However, data on the effect of SVR on the risk of EHMs are limited. Studies conducted in Japan and Taiwan demonstrated that SVR reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, stroke, renal disease and acute coronary syndrome in HCV-infected individuals.21–24 People with active HCV infection may also have a higher risk of malignant lymphoma compared with those who achieved SVR.25 Symptoms of mixed cryoglobulinaemia improve and some indolent NHLs regress after AVT.26–29 There have been no population-based studies that evaluated the risk of EHMs after SVR in HCV-infected people in the USA. As some EHMs such as mixed cryoglobulinaemia, PCT and lichen planus are rare, the role of SVR in reducing the risk of these EHMs has not been evaluated.
For nearly two decades, interferon-containing AVT has formed the basis for anti-HCV treatment. The recent introduction of all oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has substantially increased the possibility of achieving SVR and preventing hepatic outcomes.15 As some extrahepatic outcomes of chronic HCV infection are rare and data on extrahepatic benefits of SVR for DAAs are still sparse, we studied the effect of SVR after interferon-based AVT on the risk of EHMs in a large cohort of HCV-infected US military veterans.
Patients and methods Data source The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) HCV Clinical Case Registry (HCV-CCR) contains health information on all known HCV-infected veterans who obtained care at any of the 128 VA medical facilities in the USA.30 The HCV-CCR automatically identifies individuals with positive HCV antibody tests, as well as any HCV-related ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, version 9) diagnosis codes from the VA electronic medical records. HCV-CCR includes data on demographics, laboratory test results and VA pharmacy data from 1 October 1995 through 1 January 2010. This study was approved by Baylor College of Medicine’s Institutional Review Board.
Study design and study population We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the HCV-CCR. We included individuals who: (1) had at least one positive test for HCV RNA in plasma by qualitative or quantitative assays between 1 October 1999 and 31 August 2009; (2) were aged 20–85 years at the earliest positive HCV RNA date (henceforth, known as the ‘HCV index date’); and (3) had at least 1 year of follow-up after the index date to allow a reasonable amount of time to ascertain baseline characteristics. We excluded treated subjects who had an HCV treatment start date (defined below) before the HCV index date.
Ascertainment of exposure, outcomes and other characteristics Our main exposure variable was receipt of AVT and its result (SVR or non-SVR). As defined previously,31 veterans were considered to be treated for HCV infection if they had at least one filled prescription of any interferon with or without ribavirin any time after the HCV index date. The date of the first
554

such interferon prescription at any VA pharmacy was considered as the start date of HCV treatment. Any further treatment occurring after a gap of >65 days was ignored, and only the first course with interferon after the HCV index date was considered. The AVT end date was defined as the last date covered by the final interferon prescription after the AVT start date. Subjects were classified as untreated for HCV infection if they did not have a VA prescription for interferon.
Subjects were considered to have attained SVR when all subsequent HCV RNA measurements after the AVT end date were undetectable, with at least one negative HCV RNA test at least 12 weeks after that date.31 We used 12 weeks instead of the clinically standard 24-week period post-AVT in the interferon era, since 98% of relapses occur within 12 weeks after treatment completion, and there is a high concordance between being free of the virus at 12 and 24 weeks.32 33 Subjects with detectable HCV RNA after AVT end date were classified as non-SVR whereas subjects who did not have any HCV RNA measurements after the AVT start date were censored as untreated at the AVT start date.
We evaluated the following eight EHMs of HCV infection: mixed cryoglobulinaemia, glomerulonephritis, PCT, lichen planus, NHL, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, starting 12 months after the HCV index date. Incident cases were identified by the presence of at least one inpatient or outpatient ICD-9 diagnosis and/or procedure codes for the corresponding outcomes (see online supplementary table 1 for definitions). For each outcome, we excluded the prevalent cases from the study; that is, if the outcome was present any time before, or within 12 months after the HCV index date.
We assessed potential confounders, including age at the HCV index date, gender, race/ethnicity, period of military service (pre-Vietnam, Vietnam, post-Vietnam eras), HCV genotype, body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), smoking, alcohol intake, hypertension and infections with HBV and HIV. Liver fibrosis was ascertained using the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) with a score ≥2 considered to represent advanced liver fibrosis. HBV infection was defined as a positive HBV surface antigen test, and HIV infection was defined as positive HIV antibody or HIV RNA test in serum. ICD-9 codes were used to define smoking, alcohol use and hypertension (online supplementary table 1). All the characteristics were ascertained at baseline, that is, any time before, or within 12 months after HCV index date.
Statistical analyses We compared the characteristics of veterans who ever received AVT to those who were never treated using χ2 tests. We calculated the incidence rate of each EHM beginning 12 months after the HCV index date for three groups: untreated, treated with SVR and treated without SVR. The untreated group included individuals who were never treated, and the follow-up time before the AVT start date in those who ever received treatment (they transitioned to the treated group at the start of AVT). EHMs that occurred during AVT were ignored, since changing HCV RNA levels during the AVT may make it difficult to classify the exposure. Thus, we evaluated treated individuals beginning at the date of SVR documentation, or for those without SVR, beginning 12 weeks after the end of AVT. For each outcome, follow-up ended at the time of an event, death or last follow-up visit at any VA facility, whichever occurred earlier.
To determine the association between AVT and risk of EHMs, separate multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression

models were constructed for each outcome. Using time-dependent treatment variables, risks of EHMs were compared between those who had AVT with SVR versus no AVT, and those who did not have SVR versus no AVT. The covariates included in the main models were selected based on a priori knowledge of important factors that affect the risk of EHMs and comprised age at HCV index date, gender, sex, race/ethnicity, period of service, BMI, smoking, and alcohol abuse for all outcomes, and additional adjustment for diabetes and hypertension (at baseline) for glomerulonephritis, CHD and stroke. Missing information was treated as a separate category for each variable in the analyses. We further compared risks for treated patients with SVR versus without SVR using multivariable Cox PH regression models as described above. Adjustment of p values for multiple comparisons was conducted by using the Benjamini and Hochberg method with a false discovery rate of 10%.34
The PH assumption was tested by including interaction terms for the effect of treatment response (AVT with/without SVR) with follow-up time and evaluating the significance of that interaction term. When the PH assumption was not satisfied, we introduced terms for the interaction of treatment response with ‘time from the HCV index date to initiation of AVT,’ since the effect of AVT may depend on when it is started after HCV diagnosis. For the models with the interaction, the PH assumption was then tested again as done previously and found to be met. Results are presented for main effects of treatment response (when the PH assumption was satisfied) or with interaction effects centred at the median time to initiation of AVT (when the PH assumption was not satisfied). Plots for adjusted HRs (aHRs) with their corresponding 95% CIs were constructed for the models with interaction terms when AVT was initiated at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after the HCV index date.
We also conducted some sensitivity and exploratory subgroup analyses. First, we excluded all people with HBV or HIV infection since these infections are associated with some outcomes such as NHL. Second, we used a stricter definition of the EHMs by requiring at least one inpatient or two outpatient diagnosis codes at least 30 days apart to improve the specificity of the outcome definitions. Finally, we analysed the risk of EHMs in various subgroups formed by the presence or absence of advanced liver disease at baseline (APRI scores ≥2 and <2, respectively), and the three main HCV genotypes (genotypes 1, 2 and 3) to determine whether the results differ by the liver disease status or HCV genotypes.
Results Study population We included 160 875 veterans (figure 1) who had a median follow-up of 5.1 years (IQR, 2.9–7.2 years). Most veterans were 50–59 years of age (52.1%), male (97.1%) and had served in the Vietnam War era (69.2%) (table 1). A large proportion of subjects were non-Hispanic white (44.9%), overweight (BMI 25 to <30 kg/m2, 38.5%) or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 27.3%), smokers (59.2%) or alcohol abusers (58.3%), and had APRI score ≥2 (24.8%). The most common HCV genotype was genotype 1 (54.7%), although many individuals were not tested for genotype (31.4%). HBV and HIV coinfections were present in 1.3% and 3.2% of HCV-infected veterans, respectively.
Approximately 19% of veterans (n=31 143) received AVT during the follow-up, of whom 34% (n=10 575) achieved SVR. The median duration of AVT was 24.2 weeks (IQR, 10.9–46 weeks). As shown in table 1, compared with nevertreated veterans, treated veterans were more likely to be

younger (median age, 50.8 vs 52.3 years), non-Hispanic white (54.8% vs 42.5%), have higher BMI (median, 27.9 vs 26.7 kg/ m2) and had APRI score ≥2 (26.4% vs 24.5%); less likely to have coinfections with HBV (1.0% vs 1.3%) or HIV (2.4% vs 3.4%), or hypertension (46.2% vs 52.7%); and less likely to be smokers (54.5% vs 60.3%) or alcohol abusers (48.5% vs 60.6%).
Risk of EHMs by treatment status Most EHMs were rare (incidence rates <1 per 1000 personyears), except for glomerulonephritis, diabetes and stroke (table 2). In general, EHM incidence was lower in the treated groups when compared with untreated veterans (except for lichen planus). The lowest incidence rates were observed in individuals who received AVT with attainment of SVR, for all outcomes except for CHD and stroke.
After adjusting for potential confounders and multiple comparisons, individuals who received AVT with attainment of SVR had significantly lower risk of mixed cryoglobulinaemia (aHR=0.61; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94), glomerulonephritis (aHR=0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79), PCT (aHR=0.41; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.83), NHL (aHR=0.64; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.95), diabetes (aHR=0.82; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.88) and stroke (aHR=0.84; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94) compared with untreated veterans (table 3). EHM risk was not lowered in those who did not achieve SVR, except for glomerulonephritis (aHR=0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.96) and stroke (aHR=0.82; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90), and was increased for lichen planus (aHR=1.56; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.99) and diabetes (aHR=1.14; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.20).
When the analysis was restricted to treated patients, veterans with SVR had lower risk for mixed cryoglobulinaemia (aHR=0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90), glomerulonephritis (aHR=0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99), PCT (aHR=0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.65) and diabetes (aHR=0.72, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78) compared with those without SVR (table 3).
In comparing individuals with SVR to those who did not receive AVT, the PH assumption was satisfied for the main models for mixed cryoglobulinaemia, diabetes and CHD, and for models containing the interaction terms with ‘time from the HCV index date to initiation of AVT’ for glomerulonephritis, PCT, lichen planus, NHL and stroke. We observed gradual reductions in the magnitude of protective aHRs towards the null with increasing time to initiation of AVT for glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke (figure 2). The aHRs were significantly protective only when AVT was initiated at 1 or 2 years after the HCV index date for glomerulonephritis and stroke, and 1 year for NHL. For PCT, the aHRs became more protective with longer time between the HCV index date and AVT, although the aHRs were significant only when AVT was initiated at 1 or 2 years. The aHRs for lichen planus were not significant and changed minimally over time.
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses Associations were similar to those in the primary analyses when individuals with HBV or HIV coinfections were excluded (online supplementary table 2). When we used a stricter definition for the outcomes, significance of the association was no longer maintained for PCT and NHL when patients with SVR were compared with untreated patients (online supplementary table 3). When HCV-infected veterans who achieved SVR were compared with those who were never treated, the risk of mixed cryoglobulinaemia was reduced in those with advanced liver disease, the risk of glomerulonephritis and PCT was reduced in those without

advanced liver disease, and the risk of diabetes and stroke was reduced irrespective of the baseline APRI score (online supplementary table 4). However, the CIs for the risk estimates were wide and overlapped each other due to small number of outcomes in the two subgroups. Similarly, overlapping wide CIs for the risk estimates were obtained when we evaluated the risk of EHMs according to different genotypes (online supplementary table 5).
Discussion In this large cohort study of HCV-infected US veterans, we found that SVR reduces the risk of some HCV-associated EHMs, such as mixed cryoglobulinaemia, glomerulonephritis, PCT, NHL, diabetes

and stroke. These findings further strengthen the epidemiological evidence for their association with HCV infection. Furthermore, HCV-related EHMs carry a significant economic burden due to direct medical costs and indirect costs due to loss of productivity.35 The results of our study emphasise the extrahepatic benefits of SVR.
Our findings also have important clinical implications. With the advent of DAAs, substantial improvements in SVR rates have been achieved with a shorter duration of AVT and fewer side effects than interferon-based AVT.15 As more patients are treated with DAAs, we expect greater benefits of SVR including reduced risk of EHMs of chronic HCV infection, assuming that the clinical benefits of SVR remain similar with interferon-based

compared with interferon-free treatment regimens. Recent reports suggest that the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma may not decrease in spite of increased SVR rates with the DAAs,36–38 which may be due to differences in characteristics of patients who received interferon-free versus interferon-based AVT.36 38 Hence, our results need to be replicated in a cohort of HCV-infected patients who received DAAs.

Chronic HCV infection is associated with lymphoproliferative conditions such as mixed cryoglobulinaemia and B cell NHLs.39 40 AVT for HCV infection is beneficial for patients with HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinaemia or indolent NHLs, as they can have complete resolution of symptoms of cryoglobulinaemia and lymphoma regression.27–29 41 We found that AVT with SVR also significantly reduces the risk

of mixed cryoglobulinaemia. Similarly, a Japanese study found that individuals with SVR had a lower risk of development of malignant lymphoma when compared with those with active HCV infection.25 We observed that AVT with SVR led to a moderate reduction in risk of B cell NHLs when compared with untreated patients. Moreover, the benefit persisted after excluding individuals who had HIV infection, thus reducing the possibility that the protective effect could be attributed to antiretroviral therapy for HIV. However, this risk reduction was not observed when AVT was started 2 or more years after the HCV index date.
Glomerulonephritis, a common renal EHM of chronic HCV infection, is characterised by subendothelial deposits of HCV-related antigen-antibody complexes in the renal glomeruli.42 43 HCV eradication can reduce the risk of proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome,42 and end-stage renal disease.24 In our study, we found reduced risk of glomerulonephritis after SVR, affirming the benefits of AVT in preventing HCV-associated renal disease.
HCV is also associated with dermatological conditions such as PCT and lichen planus.44 45 The effect of AVT on PCT or lichen planus has been inconsistent, with reports of exacerbation of symptoms of lichen planus in those who received interferon-containing regimens.46 47 A similar process may explain the increased risk for lichen planus that we observed for patients who were treated but did not attain SVR. We found that the risk

of PCT was reduced after SVR when compared with untreated individuals. The magnitude of risk reduction seemed to increase with longer time to AVT initiation, but small number of observations along with wide confidence intervals prevents us from making precise conclusions.
We observed a significantly reduced risk of diabetes in treated patients with SVR compared with untreated people. Several studies have reported an association between chronic HCV infection and type 2 diabetes mellitus.11 12 14 48 49 AVT with SVR may lead to improvements in insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell function.21 We found that the risk of diabetes was increased in treated veterans who did not achieve SVR, which was also seen in another cohort study.22 This increase may be due to the effect of interferon and persistent viral replication. Interferon therapy has been reported to induce type 1 diabetes50; however, whether it can lead to type 2 diabetes is not known.
Although several studies have shown that HCV infection is associated with cardiovascular diseases6–8 13 51 and stroke,9 10 it is unclear whether HCV itself leads to these conditions. Studies from Taiwan have shown that interferon-based AVT reduces the risk of stroke and acute coronary syndrome.23 24 In our study, we did not observe a reduced risk of CHD after AVT with SVR. Risk factor distributions for CHD vary between USA and Asian countries, and the prevalence of other risk factors may affect the HCV–CHD association. It was possible that confounding due to unmeasured risk factors such as diet may have affected our

results. However, we did observe a significant reduction in the risk of stroke in both SVR and non-SVR groups. Chronic infection may trigger immune and inflammatory responses, either locally within the blood vessels or via systemic inflammatory mediators and favour atherothrombosis.52 HCV infection is associated with high levels of circulating cryoglobulins in blood which may lead to vasculitis and development of vascular thrombi.53 Hence, treating the infection could remove the inflammatory stimuli and prevent development of stroke. But since the risk reductions were observed in both the SVR and non-SVR groups, our results may reflect the effect of interferon therapy rather than SVR and need to be verified in HCV-infected patients who were treated with interferon-free regimens.
Our study has some limitations. First, due to the nature of the veteran population being primarily male and of low socioeconomic status, the results are not generalisable to other populations. Second, the study is limited by the use of ICD-9 codes to ascertain outcomes, since there is a possibility of under-reporting or misreporting of codes by the physicians. Also, conditions such as mixed cryoglobulinaemia are often not detected clinically and may be underdiagnosed. Furthermore, only patient encounters that required a hospitalisation and/or multiple outpatient visits to a physician are likely to be captured by these definitions. However, we expect the resulting bias to be non-differential between the treated and untreated individuals and acting towards the null. We also used stricter definitions of EHMs to improve the specificity of our definitions and confirmed most results in a sensitivity analysis. Third, we did not have detailed data on potential confounding variables such as duration of smoking, number of alcoholic drinks consumed and dietary history. We used diagnostic codes to identify smoking and alcohol use, which would have likely captured those who were heavy smokers or alcohol abusers. Other possible confounders such as duration of infection, physical activity and genetic risk factors could not be measured and may affect the risk estimates. Moreover, our study was population-based and evaluated the risk of eight extrahepatic outcomes which have different risk factors and it was not possible to ascertain the potential confounders for each individual outcome. Fourth, it is possible that some patients who had spontaneous resolution of HCV infection may have been included in the untreated group. But that would likely reduce the risk of outcomes in the untreated patients and the resulting bias would be towards the null. Fifth, treated patients may have different unmeasured characteristics compared with those who were not treated. Hence, we compared the risk of EHMs among the treated patients who did and did not achieve SVR and confirmed most of our findings. Sixth, differences in the receipt of AVT according to the baseline liver disease status or HCV genotype were possible. Hence, we conducted subgroup analyses to evaluate the risk of EHMs according to liver disease status and HCV genotype. However, the small number of outcomes in the strata meant that our risk estimates in the subgroup analyses were not precise. Finally, some subjects may seek care and get treated outside the VA system, leading to misclassification of exposure or outcome status.
A strength of our study is the use of a large cohort of more than 150 000 HCV-infected veterans in the USA. The large size allowed us to systematically evaluate the effect of AVT with SVR on the risk of EHMs, particularly for some rare conditions such as mixed cryoglobulinaemia, PCT, lichen planus and NHL. The HCV-CCR provides access to data on medical diagnoses and allows evaluation of laboratory results and pharmacy prescriptions. Evaluation of EHMs was also facilitated
560

by the long follow-up available. We also conducted several sensitivity analyses, which generally confirmed our findings, although a few associations lost statistical significance when we used a strict definition to define the outcomes.
To summarise, we observed a significant reduction in the risk of several EHMs of chronic HCV infection with AVT and attainment of SVR. However, early initiation of AVT may be required to reduce the risk of glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke. Although future studies will need to evaluate the effects of DAAs, the benefits associated with SVR following interferon-based AVT suggest great promise in reducing the risk of EHMs.
