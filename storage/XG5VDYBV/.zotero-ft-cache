If an outpatient repeatedly sees the same practitioner, is his care
influenced? This double-blind randomized trial examines the effects of
outpatient health care provider continuity on the process and outcome of the medical care for 776 men aged 55 years and older. Participants were randomized to two different groups of provider care: provider discontinuity and provider continuity. The outcome of the continuity group was significantly different from that of the discontinuity group. During an 18-month period, patients who had been randomized to the continuity group had fewer emergent admissions (20% v 39%) and a shorter average length of stay (15.5 v 25.5 days). These patients also perceived that the providers were more knowledgeable, thorough, and interested in patient education. We conclude that continuity of outpatient provider care for men aged 55 years and older results in more patient satisfaction, shorter hospitalizations, and fewer
emergent hospital admissions. (JAMA 1984;252:2413-2417)

studies, provider continuity was the only independent variable. In only
four of the 16 studies26 were the
conclusions decisive; in the remain¬ der, méthodologie problems cast
doubt on the findings. The conclu¬ sions were as follows: (1) patient and
staff satisfaction increased when con¬
tinuity was achieved, (2) no negative effects of provider continuity on qual¬ ity of care were demonstrated, and (3) in pédiatrie practices, patient ap¬ pointment and medication compliance was increased, and disclosure of behavioral problems was enhanced for children who experienced continu¬ ity with a provider.
If provider continuity does alter

either the process or the outcome of
medical care, the result of provider continuity might be most evident with those persons who frequently visit medical care providers. Because
the medical care system can adminis¬
tratively effect provider continuity, studying the impact of continuity on patients who frequently visit medical care providers may suggest implementable changes in medical care system policies.
This study of provider continuity
was undertaken for two reasons. The
first was to determine, using a con¬ trolled experimental design, the im¬ pact of provider continuity on the course of patients' illnesses. The sec¬
ond was to determine if the results of
the previous studies,2* all four of which were based either on pédiatrie patients or on physicians-in-training, could be generalized to elderly pa¬
tients in a more conventional clinical
setting than a house staff training
program.

patients nor their general medical pro¬ viders were aware of the patients' group assignment.
Patients were followed up for 2.5 years
after randomization. The dependent pro¬
cess and outcome variables appear in
Table 1. A fair test of the hypothesis required that the experimental interven¬
tion have sufficient time for the differ¬
ences in provider continuity of care to be
established. Twelve months were allowed
for this purpose. The initial 12 months of
the study were called "the equilibration period." Thereafter, during the final 18 months of the study, the process of care and the outcome variables were analyzed for possible effects of the different types of provider continuity experienced by the patients. The final 18 months were consid¬ ered the analysis period.
The Setting and Providers
All 17 members of the permanent medi¬ cal staff (ten board-certified internists,
three nurse practitioners, and four physi¬
cian assistants) at the VAGMC whose employment spanned the entire study
period agreed to participate. Together,
these clinicians accounted for 7.7 full-time
equivalents and provided approximately 78% of the general medical daytime out¬ patient care for either scheduled or

unscheduled study patients. Twelve per¬ cent of the remaining general medical visits involved a nonparticipating staff member whose employment did not span the entire study period, and 9% involved
the seven internal medicine residents who
followed up patients in the clinic. Inpatient medical care, night calls, and
weekend coverage were provided by the internal medicine house staff, supervised both by the participating internists as well as three nonparticipating specialists on a rotating basis. A unit record allowed the inpatient staff to be aware of the outpa¬ tient treatments and providers.
Patient Selection and Exclusion
To be included in the study, a patient had to be age 55 years or older, and his one-way mileage from home to the VAGMC had to be 144 km (90 miles) or less. Patients were excluded who (1) used the VAGMC less than they used another provider within or outside of the Veterans Medical System, (2) used specialty care only, (3) had a single psychiatric diagnosis including the diagnosis of alcohol abuse, (4) had not used the VAGMC during the previous six months, (5) were not mentally competent or alert, and (6) refused to consent to the study. Of the 1,074 patients who met the age and mileage criteria, 298

were excluded, the majority because of the
first exclusion criterion.
At the time of enrollment in the study, the average participant had used the VAGMC for 6.5 years and had experienced discontinuous provider care until major reorganization of the VAGMC in 1977. From 1977 to 1978, patients were routinely scheduled to see the same provider for follow-up visits. The study began in 1979.
Informed Consent and Random
Assignment to Study Modes
After giving written informed consent (as approved by the Institution Review Board), patients were randomized in triplets to either the discontinuity (one third of patients) or continuity (two thirds of patients) groups of provider care. The patients' identification cards were coded so that only the scheduling clerks and research assistants knew the meaning of
the code.
Patients assigned to the discontinuity
group had a die tossed at each scheduled
follow-up visit so that, at each visit, they had a 33% chance of being sent to a different provider. In addition, after one year of the study, the schedules of these patients were examined weekly by the
research assistants. Whenever the same
general medical provider had been seen more than twice in a row by a patient in the discontinuity group, the patient was assigned to a different provider.
Patients assigned to receive continuity care were routinely scheduled by the scheduling clerks to see the same provider for follow-up visits.
Double-blind Design
To keep patients and providers unaware of patient assignment, the following four mechanisms were used. First, providers were not aware of patient-scheduling changes because rescheduling at the VAGMC site was always performed by the
clerical staff. Providers did not know
about the code used to identify patients and the study group to which the patients had been assigned. Second, assigned pro¬ viders were not notified of a patient's admission to the hospital by special chan¬ nels. Third, only 10% of the patients seen annually in the VAGMC were study par¬ ticipants. Fourth, the changes in schedul¬ ing that affected the patients in the dis¬ continuity group occurred gradually. Since many of these patients had experienced discontinuous provider care in the past, the changes were not unusual experiences
for them.
Deaths, Withdrawals, and Data Completion Rates
After 30 months, 78 (51 continuity, 27 discontinuity) of the 776 patients had died

and 11 patients had moved away. Of these 89 patients, 11.6% (60/520) were in the continuity group and 11.3% (29/256) in the discontinuity group.
Of the 43 patients who withdrew during the 30 months of the study, 8% (21/256)
were in the discontinuous and 4% were
(22/520) in the continuous provider groups (P<.05). The patients who withdrew most frequently cited dissatisfaction or a desire to be followed up by a specialist.
The final patient questionnaire was completed by 579 (84% ) of the 687 patients who were still living in the area at the end of the study. The final questionnaire assessed the patient's functional ability,
attitudes toward health care received in
the study site, and utilization of health care facilities outside the study site.
At 30 months, study site clinic and hospitalization data obtained from the medical record were complete for 729 (94%) of the 776 patients who were ran¬ domized and for 99% of the 738 patients who were alive and living in the area after the first 12 months of the study.
Data Measurement and Analysis
The dependent variables shown in Table 1 were obtained by the research assistants, using the methods listed. In addition, the hospital discharge summaries of patients admitted to the hospital during the final 18 months of the study were reviewed by two physicians (J.H.W. and A.E.S.) and categorized as emergent, urgent, or elective. In all discharge summary audits, the physicians were unaware of the patient's study group. The two physicians'
assessments of the admission were in
initial agreement 91% of the time. Classi¬
fication disagreements were resolved by discussion of patient data by the physi¬ cians using the following criteria:
1. Emergent: immediate hospitalization for lifesaving care. Examples were sepsis, pulmonary emboli, acute respiratory de¬ compensation, incarcerated hernia, to "rule out" acute myocardial infarction, and new arrhythmia with hypotension.
2. Urgent: hospitalization required within a period of two weeks or less. Examples were new gross hematuria, pro¬ gressive respiratory decompensation, and undiagnosed syncope of several weeks'
duration.
3. Elective: neither urgent nor emer¬ gent. These admissions were often sched¬ uled weeks in advance.
The independent variable—the degree of provider continuity—was measured by the following previously developed measures:
1. The raw percentage of total medical visits a patient experienced with their primary provider.'
2. The series of sequential visits a patient had with a provider in the
VAGMC.S

The percentage of visits with a primary provider is easily derived, but it considers one provider and is only reliable when the number of visits is large. The continuity of care index adjusts for numbers of differ¬ ent providers and the total number of visits. The series of sequential visits pro¬ vides another estimate of the longitudinal relationship between the patient and pro¬
vider.
The data were analyzed using the F test (for parametric data), the x2. and the Kruskal-Wallis test on ranks (for nonparametric data).
When a patient died or withdrew from the study, data collected on him were analyzed in the study group to which he had been assigned. Incomplete data were
not entered into the calculation of inde¬
pendent and dependent variables.

RESULTS Patient Characteristics
Patients randomly assigned to the discontinuous (N=256) and continu¬ ous care groups (N=520) were medi-

cally comparable prior to the analysis period of the study (Table 2).
Measurement of
Provider Continuity
For the final 18 months of the
study, significant variation in pro¬ vider continuity was measurable be¬ tween patients in the discontinuity and continuity groups (Table 3). In addition, Table 3 shows that when patients were asked if they could identify their single provider of care, 71% of those in the continuity group answered "yes" at completion of the study in contrast to 51% for patients assigned to receive discontinuous care (P<.001). Patient responses were not sensitive to low continuity of care
indexes: when the measured continui¬
ty of care index was less than 0.25, 51% of the patients claimed continui¬ ty, as compared with 83% of the
patients who claimed continuity when
the index was greater than 0.60.
Effects of Provider Discontinuity
Patients who received discontin¬
uous care experienced an almost two¬
fold increase in the amount of emer¬
gency admissions and hospital days. Since hospitalization rates were iden¬ tical (0.6 per patient per year; P>.5), the increased average hospital days for patients in the discontinuity group was due to a greater length of
stay per admission. Increased emer¬
gency admission and hospital length of stay were appropriately associated,
with more time spent in the intensive
care unit by patients in the discon¬ tinuity group.

Compared to patients in the con¬ tinuity group, patients in the discon¬ tinuity group were less satisfied with the continuity and educational as¬ pects of the medical care they received. The patients in the discon¬ tinuity group also believed that the providers were not as knowledgeable and thorough.
Of the many variables studied (Ta¬ ble 1), only those cited in Table 4 demonstrated significant differences (P<.05) between the groups.
COMMENT
We sought to determine, using a controlled experimental design, the effects of provider continuity on the
medical care and clinical outcome of
patients' illnesses.
We observed that lack of continui¬
ty—defined as either discontinuity or a disruption of the relationship between patient and provider—was
associated with more emergency hos-
pitalizations and an increased time in
both the intensive care unit and the
hospital.

We also sought to determine if the results of previous studies, largely based on pédiatrie patients, cared for by house staff, would be observed in an older population where ambulato¬ ry care was not provided by house
staff. We observed that continuous
care positively influenced some pa¬ tient attitudes about the quality of care they had received. We observed no negative effects of provider con¬ tinuity on patient care. This study did not show, for patients receiving con¬
tinuous care, greater accuracy in the medical records' medication lists, bet¬
ter use of prevention measures (smoking cessation, blood pressure control, or Hemoccult slide), an effect on a patient's perception of access or quality of care, an improvement of
functional status, or a difference in
the prescription of medications. Out¬ patient visits, referrals, missed ap¬ pointment rates, and unscheduled vis¬ its were similar for both study
groups. No differences in the use of
non-study site health care facilities
were observed.

The controlled experimental design seemed to be executed adequately. Patient diagnostic and demographic
characteristics were similar between
study groups at the time of random¬ ization and subsequently during the course of the study. By all indications, patients and clinicians remained blinded to the patient assignment. Less than 6% of the patients asked to be withdrawn from the study. Ques¬
tionnaire response rates and utiliza¬ tion of non-VA health facilities were
similar between patients assigned to the discontinuity and the continuity groups of provider care. During the final 18 months of the study, all measures of outpatient provider con¬ tinuity were significantly different between patients assigned to receive discontinuous provider care and pa¬ tients assigned to receive continuous provider care.
Four aspects of this study deserve further comment. First, the findings suggest that policies favoring im¬ proved outpatient provider continuity may result in significant financial savings. This study does not address the issue of inpatient provider con¬ tinuity. When patients were ad¬ mitted, they were cared for by super¬ vised house staff, and the clinician who cared for each patient in the clinic was not, by protocol, routinely notified of the patient's admission. Therefore, one could argue that the study protocol, by not ensuring inpa¬ tient continuity, might have mini¬ mized the difference (and potential financial savings) between the discon¬ tinuity and the continuity provider groups. Second, this study required the analysis of multiple process and outcome measures; therefore, one is
confronted with an increased risk of
falsely concluding that an observed difference is significant. The signifi¬ cantly (P=.03) increased use of chest roentgenograms and ECGs by con¬ tinuity providers may fall into this category, since no similar pattern for other outpatient tests or procedures was measured. However, the observed adverse effects of provider discon¬ tinuity—increased number of hospi¬ tal days and dissatisfaction with
some aspects of care received—are
consistently supported by several var¬ iables. Third, many of our patients had experienced discontinuous care prior to the beginning of the study.

Such patients might accept and express satisfaction with fragmented outpatient care more readily than private patients would. Finally, al¬ though this study reported measure¬ ments of provider continuity for both groups of patients, it is difficult to
ascertain whether the measurements
reported here are high or low in comparison with other studies. The

reason for this is that the published studies81516 using comparable mea¬ sures have suggested that patient characteristics affect provider con¬ tinuity, yet these same studies do not provide adequate descriptions of their patient populations to allow compari¬ son with the patients described here¬
in.
We conclude that continuity of out-

patient provider care results in more patient satisfaction and also fewer emergent, prolonged hospitalizations.
