ABSTRACT
Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) refers to the subset of disorders affecting the structure and function of the coronary microcirculation, is prevalent in patients across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular risk factors, and is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Contemporary evidence supports that most patients with CMD also have macrovessel atherosclerosis, which has important implications for their prognosis and management. In this state-of-theart review, the authors summarize the pathophysiology of CMD, provide an update of diagnostic testing strategies, and classify CMD into phenotypes according to severity and coexistence with atherosclerosis. They examine emerging data highlighting the signiﬁcance of CMD in speciﬁc populations, including obesity and insulin resistance, myocardial injury and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and nonobstructive and obstructive coronary artery disease. Finally, they discuss the role of CMD as a potential target for novel interventions beyond conventional approaches, representing a new frontier in cardiovascular disease reduction.

S ince the early 1900s, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has accounted for the highest number of disease-related deaths in the developed world (1), but hidden in this stable statistic are indications that CVD is changing. Angina and dyspnea remain common presenting complaints, but for a high proportion of cardiac patients now seeking an explanation for their symptoms in the catheterization laboratory, no signiﬁcantly obstructing coronary lesion is found (2–4). Despite this, their prognosis is not necessarily benign (2,3). Over the last 2 decades, diagnostic yields have fallen not only for invasive coronary angiography (2,3), but also for noninvasive stress testing (5). Meanwhile, the incidence of acute presentations of atherothrombotic plaque rupture causing myocardial infarction (MI), particularly with ST-segment elevation, has decreased (6), whereas

the rates of hospitalizations with a secondary MI diagnosis and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (7) have risen sharply. These observations follow other epidemiological shifts in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the population, including the growth of obesity, glucose intolerance, and older age (1).
SMALL VESSELS, LARGE IMPACT
Often synonymous with coronary artery disease (CAD), heart disease has been conventionally deﬁned anatomically as obstructive atherosclerosis involving the epicardial coronary arteries (Figure 1A). There is now greater recognition that structural and functional disorders affecting the whole coronary circulation, including the microcirculation (Figure 1B),

termed ischemic heart disease (IHD). The subset of disorders affecting the coronary microcirculation itself is termed coronary microvascular disease (CMD). Consequently, symptomatic patients without identiﬁable obstructive plaque may still harbor signiﬁcant nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis and microvascular ischemia with resultant increased rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). How should these patients be optimally managed? At the present, no guideline-directed recommendations exist. This gap in the scientiﬁc and clinical evidence base has led to increased calls for research directed at expanding diagnostic

tools to address the full spectrum of IHD affecting

patients, which is facilitating a transformation in how

CVD is deﬁned. Previously important distinctions,

such as “primary” versus “secondary” prevention, are

becoming obsolete, and the outsized role of CMD on

the persistence of symptoms and prognosis of CVD is

becoming more apparent.

Despite pioneering efforts, confusion surrounding

CMD remains (8–13). First, there is the challenge of

nomenclature. Variously described in the past,

including with the nonspeciﬁc term coronary syn-

drome X, CMD risks losing meaning for the clinical

provider if it is not objectively diagnosed. Second,

because it is too small to be directly imaged in pa-

tients in vivo, the coronary microcirculation repre-

sents a complex series of compartments that must be

evaluated indirectly through standardized methods

designed to perturb its function in regulating

myocardial blood ﬂow. Third, pathology affecting the

microcirculation does not exist in a vacuum, but is

intricately linked to that of the macrocirculation via

direct physical as well as humoral factors. Contem-

porary evidence (14–16) strongly supports the coex-

istence of CMD with atherosclerosis in most affected

patients, and this consideration represents a critical

differentiator for what may constitute appropriate

therapeutic strategies in CMD. The interaction of

macrovessel atherosclerosis with microvessel

ischemia is fundamental to the effective diagnosis

and management of disease and represents a central

thesis of this review. Here, we summarize what is

known about the pathophysiology of CMD, provide an

update of diagnostic testing strategies, and classify

CMD into phenotypes according to severity and

coexistence with atherosclerosis. We examine

emerging data highlighting the signiﬁcance of CMD in

speciﬁc populations, including obesity and insulin

resistance, myocardial injury and HFpEF, and nonobstructive and obstructive CAD. Finally, we discuss the role of CMD as a potential target for novel interventions beyond conventional approaches.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CMD: STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES
The coronary arterial system represents a continuous network of functionally distinct vessel segments of decreasing size (Central Illustration) (9,10). The prox-
imal large epicardial coronary arteries (>400 mm) give way to small pre-arterioles (100 to 400 mm) and smaller intramural arterioles (<100 mm) that interface directly with the coronary capillary bed (<10 mm). The
epicardial arteries have a primary conductance function and exhibit minimal resistance to coronary ﬂow under normal conditions, with their diameters regulated by shear stress and endothelial function. In contrast, the pre-arterioles and arterioles make up most of the resistance circuit of the heart and are responsible for regulation and distribution of blood ﬂow to match the dynamic needs of local tissue metabolism via the coronary capillaries (9,10).
MICROVASCULAR REGULATION OF CORONARY BLOOD FLOW AND MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION. In healthy vessels, coronary blood ﬂow and myocardial perfusion are regulated by coronary arteriolar tone (Central Illustration). Coronary blood ﬂow remains constant over a wide range of coronary perfusion pressures through dynamic changes in resistance vessel tone. These dynamic changes result from a series of partially redundant mechanisms, including adrenergic stimuli, changes in local oxygen tension, and the response to changes in transmural pressure (10,17). Such redundant control of coronary blood ﬂow helps to mitigate myocardial ischemia during the development and progression of epicardial atherosclerosis. Because myocardial oxygen extraction is near-maximal at rest, myocardial oxygen delivery is almost completely dependent on coronary blood ﬂow. Consequently, an increase in myocardial oxygen demand must be matched by a proportional increase in coronary blood ﬂow to prevent myocardial ischemia. CMD attenuates coronary ﬂow augmentation in response to stress and, if severe enough to lead to demand-supply mismatch, may lead to subclinical or clinical myocardial ischemia.
SPECTRUM OF VASCULAR ABNORMALITIES IN CMD
STRUCTURAL ABNORMALITIES. A number of structural changes, or microvascular remodeling, have been

associated with CMD (Central Illustration). This spectrum of abnormalities does not include atheroma, which occurs in epicardial arteries, but is nonetheless likely magniﬁed by the presence of atherosclerosis, particularly in patients with CVD risk factors. These changes lead to microvascular obstruction with luminal narrowing of the intramural arterioles and capillaries, and capillary rarefaction, often in the context of increased left ventricular (LV) mass. Evidence of microvascular remodeling has been reported in some (18–22) but not all (23,24) studies, and is consistently linked to risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and renal impairment, or evidence of diffuse epicardial atherosclerosis (18–22).
FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES. Ample evidence exists that endothelial dysfunction in resistance coronary vessels is an important contributor to CMD. The vascular endothelium plays a pivotal role in modulating smooth muscle function by releasing vasoactive substances, including nitric oxide. In the presence of normal endothelial function, acetylcholine and physiological stimuli (e.g., exercise) produce vasodilation of the coronary epicardial and microvascular circulation, thereby resulting in increased coronary blood ﬂow and myocardial perfusion. However, with the development of CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis, the vascular endothelium becomes dysfunctional and the vasodilator response to pharmacological and physiological interventions is attenuated, resulting in blunted coronary blood ﬂow augmentation or vasoconstriction with frank reduction in blood ﬂow (25).

There is evidence that functional abnormalities of smooth muscle cells regulating arteriolar tone are also present in many patients with CMD. Attenuated vasodilator responses to papaverine, adenosine, or dipyridamole, which are largely mediated by vascular smooth muscle relaxation of resistive vessels, have been documented in patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome (26–28), dyslipidemia (29,30), hypertension (31,32), obesity (33), smoking (34), renal impairment (35,36), and cardiomyopathy (37,38). Coronary spasm is part of the spectrum of vasomotor abnormalities seen in patients with CMD and affects large and small coronary arteries. Acetylcholineinduced epicardial or microvascular spasm has been reported in approximately 50% of patients with stable chest pain and no evidence of obstructive CAD (39). The pathogenesis of coronary spasm appears to be closely linked to atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction (13).
ADDITIONAL ROLE OF DIFFUSE NONOBSTRUCTIVE ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Diffuse nonobstructive atherosclerosis in the epicardial coronary arteries is a common ﬁnding in the majority of symptomatic patients with CMD. In studies involving patients with chest pain and no obstructive CAD, nearly 70% to 80% of patients showed evidence of diffuse nonobstructive atherosclerosis by intravascular ultrasound (14,40) or coronary arterial calciﬁcations (15). The association of nonobstructive atherosclerosis with CMD has

important clinical implications. First, there is evidence that more than one-half of atherosclerotic coronary arteries without focally obstructive stenoses display a signiﬁcant longitudinal pressure gradient (41) affecting coronary blood ﬂow and myocardial perfusion (42), which can contribute to myocardial ischemia and symptoms. This may help to explain the discrepancy between ischemic symptoms and the low frequency of obstructive CAD in large registries of invasive coronary angiography (2–4) and recent diagnostic clinical trials with cardiac computed tomography angiography (43,44). Second, the recognition that symptoms in patients with nonobstructive CAD may be related to CMD offers an opportunity for directing additional investigations to improving diagnosis and management.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF CMD: ROLE OF NONINVASIVE AND INVASIVE TESTING
The clinical presentation and diagnosis of IHD has long been inﬂuenced by the practice of deﬁning heart disease as obstructive CAD and tailoring diagnostic (and treatment) strategies to this subset of patients. The accuracy of standard noninvasive diagnostic testing for ischemia, however, can vary signiﬁcantly when evaluated against a gold standard of ﬁnding anatomic obstructive CAD. This poses a particular challenge for patients whose symptoms are less likely to be explained by ﬁndings on coronary angiography and whose abnormal stress tests in the absence of obstructive CAD are more likely to be interpreted as “false positives.” The recent application of modern diagnostic tools is changing the paradigm of disease diagnosis, broadening the deﬁnitions of CAD and ischemia to better reﬂect prevalent pathological phenotypes including CMD.
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF CMD. Cardinal manifestations of CMD include angina, exertional dyspnea, and possibly heart failure. The combination of symptoms is common. The natural history of CMD has a relatively long asymptomatic phase during which patients may be identiﬁed only incidentally. Angina occurs in approximately 30% to 60% of patients with CMD (15,45–48). It is indistinguishable from angina caused by obstructive CAD in that it is commonly precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. Atypical angina, including episodes of chest pain at rest, is also common. Patients may also manifest with a gradual decrease in exercise tolerance or dyspnea on exertion (12,15,45–49). Exertional dyspnea may represent an ischemic equivalent caused by LV diastolic dysfunction, with an excessive rise in

end-diastolic pressure leading to cardiopulmonary congestion. Exertional symptoms may also result from a limited ability to increase cardiac output with exercise.
LIMITATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. Many patients with CMD have normal ﬁndings on physical examination. The single best clue to diagnosis may be the detailed clinical history, including ascertainment of risk factors, which overlap signiﬁcantly with those of atherosclerotic CVD. In patients presenting with heart failure, the typical signs of elevated ﬁlling pressure, including jugular venous distention, rales, and pedal edema, may be present. The resting electrocardiogram is normal or nondiagnostic in most patients.
Exercise stress testing for detection of myocardial ischemia is a Class I recommendation for patients with suspected CAD (50). A positive exercise stress test has been traditionally used as a requirement for the diagnosis of CMD (12). However, large studies including women and men with chest pain and nonobstructive CAD found that a positive exercise stress test was neither sensitive nor speciﬁc for CMD (46,47). Stress imaging tests, such as with echocardiography or nuclear scintigraphy, are frequently normal but can occasionally show regional abnormalities that may not follow typical vascular distributions. As such, conventional stress testing with or without imaging is neither sensitive nor speciﬁc for detecting CMD, and thus has a limited role in its diagnosis.
Because the coronary microcirculation is beyond the resolution of invasive or noninvasive coronary angiography, direct interrogation of coronary microvascular function is necessary to establish the diagnosis of CMD (12). There are several noninvasive and invasive approaches for the evaluation of coronary vasomotor dysfunction (Table 1), each with advantages and limitations.
NONINVASIVE TECHNIQUES FOR DIAGNOSING CMD. Noninvasive diagnosis relies on interrogation of coronary vasomotor function by measuring regional and global myocardial blood ﬂow at rest and during stress, microvascular resistance, and coronary ﬂow reserve (CFR). CFR, calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to rest absolute myocardial blood ﬂow, is a measure of coronary vasomotor dysfunction that integrates the hemodynamic effects of focal, diffuse, and small-vessel disease on myocardial tissue perfusion. CMD can be deﬁned practically as impaired CFR in the absence of epicardial ﬂow-limiting (obstructive) CAD, reﬂecting downstream vasomotor dysfunction. As discussed later, whereas some

patients may have coexistence of focal obstructive CAD and CMD, and others may manifest CMD in the absence of detectable atherosclerosis, it is becoming clear that a large proportion of patients demonstrate CMD in the presence of diffuse nonobstructive CAD. Although quantiﬁcation of regional myocardial ischemia and regional CFR play a critical role in the assessment of focally obstructive CAD, for the purposes of this review, we focus on the use of global measurements of myocardial blood ﬂow and CFR for diagnostic and prognostic assessments of CMD affecting the collective health of the whole left ventricle.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most validated and accurate noninvasive approach for the quantitative assessment of coronary vasomotor function. Technical advances have enabled these measurements to be incorporated into routine PET myocardial perfusion stress testing (51). The imaging protocol consists of a rest and vasodilator-stress myocardial perfusion study, each following the injection of a blood ﬂow radiotracer (82Rubidium and 13N-ammonia are U.S. Food and Drug Administration– approved for this application). Post-processing of the rest and stress images allows for the quantiﬁcation of regional and global myocardial blood ﬂow (in ml/min/g of myocardium) and calculation of CFR (as the ratio of stress over rest myocardial blood ﬂow). Recent data support that coronary vascular dysfunction, as quantiﬁed by reduced CFR, is highly prevalent among patients with known or suspected CAD (15), increases the severity of inducible myocardial ischemia (beyond the effects of epicardial coronary obstruction) and subclinical myocardial injury (52), and identiﬁes patients at high risk for MACE, including cardiac death (53–55). The accuracy of PET for quantitative noninvasive measurement of myocardial blood ﬂow and CFR has been extensively validated in

experimental animals and humans, and the reproducibility of this technique is well-established (51).
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can also be used to quantify myocardial perfusion in a similar manner as PET (51), although post-processing is technically demanding and time-consuming. Like PET, the imaging protocol consists of a rest and vasodilator-stress ﬁrst-pass myocardial perfusion study, each following the injection of a gadoliniumbased contrast agent (51). Post-processing of the rest and stress images allows for the quantiﬁcation of regional and global myocardial perfusion using semiquantitative (myocardial perfusion reserve index) or fully quantitative (CFR) models. A gadolinium-free stress CMR approach using T1 mapping has also been recently proposed for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia with and without obstructive CAD (56). Advantages of CMR are high spatial resolution, allowing transmural characterization of myocardial blood ﬂow, and the lack of ionizing radiation, along with the ability to perform a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular structure and function. A reduced myocardial perfusion reserve index has been used to evaluate CMD and was shown to predict prognosis (57), but data remain limited.
Doppler echocardiography of the left anterior descending coronary artery can also be used to quantify coronary blood ﬂow velocity at rest and during vasodilator stress. Coronary ﬂow velocities are measured by pulsed-wave Doppler and assessed as diastolic peak ﬂow velocities at rest and at peak hyperemia. Coronary ﬂow velocity reserve is calculated as the ratio of hyperemic coronary ﬂow velocity to rest coronary ﬂow velocity. The advantages of this technique are its low cost, lack of ionizing radiation, and potentially broad access. Nonetheless, this technique is highly operator-dependent and requires echocardiographic visualization of the proximal coronary

arteries, which can be a signiﬁcant challenge in obese adults. There is a growing body of evidence that a reduced coronary ﬂow velocity reserve index helps to identify CMD and allows risk stratiﬁcation (58–60).
Dynamic myocardial perfusion CT can also be used to estimate myocardial blood ﬂow in a manner similar to CMR perfusion imaging. Dynamic CT scanning is performed after injection of an iodinated contrast agent with prospective electrocardiographic triggering to capture the ﬁrst pass of the contrast medium through the heart (51). These dynamic image sets are then used to produce estimates of myocardial blood ﬂow using methodology developed for CMR. The major advantages of this technique are the superior spatial resolution of CT and the opportunity to perform accurate anatomic and functional assessments of both the myocardium and the coronary arteries within 1 examination. However, these beneﬁts come at the price of a higher radiation dose to the patient.
INVASIVE TECHNIQUES FOR DIAGNOSING CMD. Invasive coronary angiography, by combining the ability to exclude obstructive CAD with complementary catheter-based techniques to probe epicardial and microvascular coronary physiology, is an attractive approach to evaluate patients with CMD. Various catheter-based measures are available and described in the following sections.
Invasive coronary ﬂow reserve (iCFR) is assessed most commonly using an intracoronary Dopplertipped guidewire or thermodilution techniques to measure coronary blood ﬂow velocity at rest and in response to adenosine (endothelium-independent) or acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent) vasodilation (25). Microvascular angina in the setting of CMD is deﬁned as symptoms of myocardial ischemia, absence of obstructive CAD, and abnormal iCFR or microvascular spasm to acetylcholine (12). In patients with suspected ischemia, reductions in adenosinestimulated iCFR have been associated with increased risk of MACE (11).
Index of microvascular resistance is calculated as the distal coronary pressure divided by the inverse of the mean transit time during maximal hyperemia. This requires the use of a combined pressuretemperature sensor-tipped coronary guidewire, which allows for simultaneous measurement of coronary pressure and hyperemic ﬂow. In patients with stable nonobstructive atherosclerosis, an abnormal index of microvascular resistance was associated with worse CVD outcomes (61).
Fractional ﬂow reserve (FFR) provides a surrogate measure of ﬂow limitation and stenosis-level

physiological obstruction and is calculated as the ratio between coronary pressure distal to a stenosis and aortic pressure during hyperemia. Evidence from randomized controlled trials supports that the use of FFR to guide clinical decisions regarding coronary revascularization leads to reduced cardiac events relative to an anatomic (62) or conservative strategy alone (63). Based on these ﬁndings, the use of FFR is now incorporated into guidelines regarding management of patients with stable IHD (50). Because FFR represents a pressure ratio across a stenosis during hyperemia, it is a relative index of epicardial conductance. Thus, it is inﬂuenced by limits to maximal achievable blood ﬂow caused by CMD and diffuse atherosclerosis. However, FFR is not primarily used to measure CMD. The presence of CMD increases microvascular resistance and may pseudonormalize FFR (64).
Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) uses wave intensity analysis to identify the mid-late diastolic instantaneous wave-free interval over which the iFR is computed. iFR is a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity, which can be obtained during diastole without administration of adenosine. This transstenotic pressure gradient is an accurate measure of the severity of a coronary stenosis and is closely correlated with FFR. In clinical trials of patients with stable angina and acute coronary syndromes, an iFRguided revascularization strategy (for iFR <0.89) was noninferior to an FFR-guided revascularization approach (for FFR <0.80) with respect to the risk of adverse events at 1 year (65,66). iFR shares some of the same limitations as FFR in the setting of CMD.
Wave-intensity analysis may also be useful in the evaluation of coronary microvascular function (67). The key measurement is the augmentation of coronary blood ﬂow that results from the re-expansion of the capillary bed during early diastole (67). Because capillary density is a signiﬁcant determinant of the capacity of the intramyocardial vasculature and the backward suction that accelerates ﬂow during diastole, quantiﬁcation of microcirculatory ﬁlling in early diastole with wave-intensity analysis may provide a measure of myocardial capillary rarefaction (68).

is generally assumed to reﬂect obstructive CAD, and many patients are referred for coronary angiography for deﬁnitive anatomic diagnosis. If obstructive CAD is identiﬁed, those patients may be considered for revascularization, depending on symptom burden and the extent and severity of myocardial ischemia and angiographic disease. However, when nonobstructive CAD is identiﬁed, the result of the stress test is typically interpreted as a “false positive.” Although in some instances this may be accurate, the

diagnosis of CMD may represent an important alternative diagnosis, especially in the presence of symptoms and positive stress testing. Those patients should be considered further for direct assessments of coronary vasomotor function via either invasive or noninvasive techniques. Although there are differences in accuracy and levels of validation between the different techniques (Table 1), the ultimate choice may depend on local availability, clinical expertise, and patient preference. Alternatively, if conventional

stress testing is negative or equivocal, but the clinical suspicion for CMD remains high, patients could be referred for coronary vasomotor reactivity testing. If the test is positive, coronary angiography can then be used to exclude obstructive CAD. I nitia l anatom ic s trategy . In selected cases, an anatomic strategy with noninvasive cardiac CT angiography or direct invasive coronary angiography may be the initial strategy. When severe obstructive CAD is conﬁrmed, patients can be considered for revascularization, depending on the symptom burden, extent and severity of angiographic disease, and presence of lesion-speciﬁc myocardial ischemia (e.g., via FFR, iFR). As in the initial functional strategy, the identiﬁcation of nonobstructive CAD in a symptomatic patient should trigger consideration of CMD with referral for specialized testing as outlined.
SPECTRUM OF CMD PHENOTYPES: INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ATHEROSCLEROSIS, ISCHEMIA, AND OUTCOMES
CMD is prevalent in a broad spectrum of CVDs. In 2007, Camici and Crea (9) proposed categories of CMD that have been useful in describing clinical settings in which CMD may occur. However, there is growing evidence that many of these conditions overlap in their clinical manifestations and pathogenesis. There also appears to be a relationship between the underlying severity of CMD and clinical risk of MACE, where coronary atherosclerosis is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient but is commonly present and interacts with CMD to mediate worse outcomes.
SIMPLIFIED CLASSIFICATION OF CMD
As such, the clinical spectrum of CMD may be contemporaneously conceptualized in terms of 3 important features of this disease with diagnostic and therapeutic implications, including the documentation of atherosclerosis (none, nonobstructive, or obstructive), the severity of CMD, and any associated clinical risk (Figure 3). This approach is simple and practical, and embeds CMD within the modern concept of distinguishing CAD risk at both the high and low range of disease severity. The interplay of CMD, CAD, and risk is clinically relevant and represents a critical differentiator for what may constitute appropriate therapeutic strategies in CMD.
CMD WITHOUT ATHEROSCLEROSIS. CMD is prevalent in a number of clinical conditions where atherosclerosis plays little or no role in its pathogenesis. For example, there is extensive published

data documenting the presence of CMD in patients with arterial hypertension (31,32,69), aortic stenosis (70), and nonischemic cardiomyopathies. The latter group includes idiopathic (37,38), hypertrophic (71,72), inﬁltrative (73), and stress (74,75) cardiomyopathies. Whether CMD in nonischemic cardiomyopathies is a cause or effect of the underlying myopathic process is unknown. However, in all of these conditions, severe CMD has been implicated in the pathophysiology of subendocardial ischemia and increased myocardial stress; subclinical myocardial injury and diffuse interstitial ﬁbrosis (76); worsening systolic and diastolic function, heart failure, and arrhythmias (77); and adverse cardiovascular events (37,38,72–75).
CMD WITH NONOBSTRUCTIVE ATHEROSCLEROSIS. Most patients undergoing evaluation for CMD have some degree of atherosclerosis, even if no obstructive lesions are found. This phenomenon, although expected given the high prevalence of CVD comorbidities in this population, represents a fundamental change from previous approaches for the classiﬁcation of CMD. Some patients may present with severe ischemia or acute MI before being diagnosed with no obstructive CAD (recently described as ischemia and no obstructive CAD [8] and MI with nonobstructive CAD [78], respectively), but the majority of these patients have atherosclerosis. It is becoming clear that CMD without obstructive CAD is not a synonym

for CMD with no CAD. Rather, it represents a separate entity with unique prognostic and therapeutic implications. This phenotype is quite prevalent, and identiﬁes patients at risk for MACE (Figure 4).
Indeed, this subgroup represents the largest cohort of patients with CMD and includes patients with cardiometabolic disease (i.e., obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus), chronic kidney disease, and HFpEF, and is disproportionately female. In obese patients, CMD is prevalent (79,80), increases in severity with increasing body mass index, and serves as a better discriminator of future CVD risk than body mass index or traditional risk factors (81). Although patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome are at a markedly increased risk of future atherosclerotic and heart failure complications, this excess risk is incompletely explained by obstructive CAD or LV dysfunction, and is signiﬁcantly higher in women with diabetes than in men with diabetes (82). Mounting evidence suggests that diabetes and

prediabetic states contribute to important alterations in the regulation of coronary vascular tone before they present with obstructive CAD (26–28). Patients with diabetes show a range of structural and functional microvascular abnormalities (as depicted in the Central Illustration), which vary in extent and severity across cardiometabolic states. Symptomatic patients with diabetes, even without known CAD, demonstrated a variable risk of events when stratiﬁed by severity of coronary vasomotor dysfunction (83), and those with metabolic syndrome and diabetes, respectively, demonstrated a stepwise increase in rates of CMD and CVD events (84). CVD is also highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), accounting for more than one-half of their associated mortality, which is not fully explained by the presence of obstructive CAD. Consistent evidence demonstrates a stepwise increase in CMD severity with decreasing glomerular ﬁltration rate (35,85), which was detectable in early CKD and led to

signiﬁcant reclassiﬁcation of CVD mortality risk across the spectrum of kidney function (35).
Recent evidence supports that CMD associated with cardiomyocyte injury and myocardial stiffness likely play an important role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF (49,52). In patients with stable CAD and preserved LV ejection fraction, chronic circulating levels of high-sensitivity troponins are common in patients with LV hypertrophy, diabetes, and CKD, and are associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular death and heart failure (86). In symptomatic, otherwise low-risk patients with minimally-elevated troponin, only those with CMD demonstrated a signiﬁcant risk of MACE (52). Moreover, CMD was independently associated with worsening diastolic dysfunction, and only in the

presence of CMD was a detectable troponin signiﬁcantly associated with diastolic dysfunction (49). Strikingly, patients with CMD and diastolic dysfunction demonstrated a >5-fold risk of HFpEF hospitalization (49) (Figure 5). With increased oxygen demand, factors tipping the balance toward cardiomyocyte injury in patients with existing CMD may worsen myocardial mechanics and increase the risk of HFpEF outcomes, even absent overt structural abnormalities or obstructive CAD (49,87–89). In particular, microvascular endothelial dysfunction, decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, and increased inﬂammatory cytokine signaling may contribute to reduced coronary microvascular density, or rarefaction, and increased myocardial ﬁbrosis observed in HFpEF (90,91).

These ﬁndings are particularly prevalent in the comorbid population of elderly women with cardiometabolic risk factors, and highlight important sex differences in the prevalence of CMD, especially among patients with nonobstructive atherosclerosis. A robust evidence base (2,11,92–95) supports that the pathophysiology of IHD in women varies from that in men. Women present with a higher burden of symptoms and comorbidities compared with men and experience similar or worse outcomes (1), but are less likely to manifest anatomic obstructive CAD, regardless of whether they present with stable IHD (2,95) or acute coronary syndromes (92,94). A major contributor to this apparent paradox is CMD, which often coexists with diffuse, nonobstructive atherosclerosis (11,15,95). CMD increases cardiovascular risk in both women and men (15), but may constitute an especially malignant phenotype in a subset of severely affected women (95). Over the lifespan, femalespeciﬁc factors may modify the development of CAD in susceptible patients into a diffuse pattern with more contribution from CMD than focal obstruction (96). Although not a uniquely female disorder, this pattern of abnormalities may be more prognostically useful in women (97), in whom it often occurs without concomitant obstructive CAD (95), and may be especially relevant in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, ischemia and no obstructive CAD, MI with nonobstructive CAD, and HFpEF. CMD WITH OBSTRUCTIVE ATHEROSCLEROSIS. CMD is also prevalent in patients with obstructive CAD. This ﬁnding is not surprising because endothelial and coronary vasomotor dysfunction represents an early manifestation of atherosclerosis, which may long precede the development of obstructive stenosis. In patients with stable CAD, reductions in microcirculatory reserve exacerbate the functional signiﬁcance of upstream coronary stenosis and may magnify the severity of inducible myocardial ischemia. From a clinical perspective, the presence of CMD in patients with stable obstructive CAD has several important diagnostic, prognostic, and management implications.
First, the variability in the severity of CMD can have a signiﬁcant effect on the evaluation of the physiological signiﬁcance of a coronary stenosis using trans-stenosis pressure gradients or noninvasive imaging for ischemia. In the presence of CMD, FFR and iFR values measured for any given stenosis are higher (and potentially pseudonormal) than when coronary microvascular resistance is normal, which can lead to underestimation of the physiological severity of a stenosis. This may help, in part, to explain discrepancies observed between obstructive lesion severity

on invasive angiography and the extent and severity of myocardial ischemia (4).
Second, emerging data from noninvasive imaging studies have consistently shown that reduced CFR measurements by PET, reﬂecting the combined hemodynamic effects of obstructive stenosis, diffuse atherosclerosis, and CMD, can identify patients at high risk for MACE, independent of angiographic disease severity (16,53–55).
Third, the severity of CMD has important implications for patient management. For example, patients with normal FFR but abnormal CFR who had revascularization deferred on the basis of FFR experienced increased adverse events, suggesting a vital role for CMD in revascularization outcomes (98). The prevalence of severe CMD in patients who have revascularization deferred based on FFR is unknown. Some studies have estimated that this phenomenon may affect up to one-third of patients with normal FFR (63,98). This suggests that interrogation of CMD in patients with obstructive CAD could potentially identify circumstances in which mixed abnormalities from upstream stenoses and the microcirculation synergize to alter the functional signiﬁcance of a focal stenosis. A recent study suggested that measurements of global CFR modiﬁed the effect of revascularization such that only patients with severely reduced global CFR appeared to beneﬁt from revascularization, and only if the revascularization included coronary artery bypass grafting (16). This supports that sensitive measures of diffuse atherosclerosis and downstream CMD may be able to guide therapeutic beneﬁt derived from more complete revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting, especially in comorbid populations with increased cardiometabolic risk. Furthermore, residual CMD may also account for the high frequency of angina at 1 and 2 years post-randomization in clinical trials of stable IHD (62,99–102), and underscores the need to optimize medical therapy to treat residual CMD that would not be improved with revascularization.
CMD also plays a role in the pathogenesis of myocardial injury in patients with acute coronary syndromes with atherothrombotic plaque rupture, even post-reperfusion. A serious complication in these patients involves microvascular obstruction, which occurs to varying degrees in approximately 50% of patients after primary percutaneous coronary intervention following ST-segment elevation MI and is associated with adverse LV remodeling and even death (103). The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of microvascular obstruction include the preexistence of CMD from atherosclerosis and a series of

pathological changes that collectively lead to obstruction of the microvessels (104).
An additional special condition includes cardiac allograft vasculopathy, which remains 1 of the leading causes of death in long-term orthotopic heart transplant survivors and the principal cause of retransplantation after 1 year. The pathogenesis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy includes intimal proliferation in the epicardial coronary arteries and medial thickening in the small intramyocardial coronary vessels, resulting in focal epicardial coronary stenoses, diffuse distal vessel tapering, obstructive microvasculopathy, and reduced capillary density. Recent studies have described signiﬁcant associations between markers of graft dysfunction, measures of coronary vasomotor dysfunction (67,105), and increased cardiovascular risk (67,105,106) in these patients.
CMD AS A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR NOVEL INTERVENTIONS
ROLE OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES. The treatment of CMD has so far been empirical because its pathophysiology is multifactorial, with overlapping phenotypes that often coexist (Figure 6A). CMD may be the primary abnormality in some patients and a secondary pathological feature in others. There are no effective therapies speciﬁcally targeting CMD. The results of available therapeutic trials have been limited by variable patient selection stemming from the lack of a standardized diagnosis, and inadequate designs with small sample size and insufﬁcient demonstration of clinical improvement (107). Nonetheless, the conventional approach to management of patients with CMD includes a number of strategies described in the following sections.
MANAGEMENT OF UNDERLYING CVD RISK FACTORS. Because of the close association of CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis in the majority of patients with CMD (Figure 3, Box A), aggressive management of comorbidities is an important goal of treatment. This includes smoking cessation, weight loss, adequate control of blood pressure, diabetes and related metabolic abnormalities, lipid management, improved nutrition, and regular exercise. Optimized medical therapy has been associated with reductions in myocardial ischemia in patients with stable CAD (108), far exceeding regression in atherosclerotic plaque burden (109), and is likely related to improved coronary microcirculatory function. Surgical weight loss has also been associated with improvements in microvascular function (110), which also may be related to improved risk factor proﬁles.

ANTIPLATELET AND LIPID-LOWERING THERAPY. Because of the strong association between atherosclerosis and CMD, low-dose aspirin (or alternative antiplatelet drugs in case of aspirin intolerance) remains an important component of patient management, even in patients with nonobstructive CAD (50). Similarly, initiation or intensiﬁcation of statin therapy in patients with documented atherosclerosis, especially in the setting of CMD (Figure 3, Box A), should be strongly considered (50). There is evidence that statin therapy improves myocardial ischemia and CMD (111).
ANTI-ISCHEMIC THERAPY. Traditional anti-ischemic drugs, including beta-blockers and short-acting nitrates, should be considered ﬁrst-line for symptom management of CMD (50). Calcium antagonists and long-acting nitrates may be helpful when used in addition to beta-blockers in cases of insufﬁcient symptom control, and are preferred when increased vasomotor tone or spasm is the presumed mechanism for symptoms (50). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (and possibly angiotensin receptor blockers) may improve coronary microvascular function by blocking the powerful vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II (50). Coronary revascularization of obstructive lesions also has a potential role in improvement of symptoms and outcomes in patients with coexistent CMD (Figure 3, Box B), especially in the setting of extensive myocardial ischemia or objective documentation of ﬂow-limiting CAD (16,50).

ANTIANGINAL THERAPY. Multiple drugs that primarily reduce angina, including ivabradine, ranolazine, mibefradil, nicorandil, and trimetazidine, have been evaluated in patients with CMD (45,48,112). Ranolazine, one of the best studied of these drugs, is thought to improve myocardial perfusion by decreasing sodium and calcium overload, thereby improving myocyte relaxation and diastolic stiffness. However, recent randomized placebo-controlled crossover trials of ranolazine in patients with CMD showed no signiﬁcant beneﬁt in symptoms or change in coronary microvascular function in patients with CMD (45,48).
POTENTIAL ROLE OF EMERGING THERAPIES: NOVEL AGENTS AND INTERVENTIONS. A number of novel therapeutic strategies have recently demonstrated improved outcomes over conventional therapies in patients with elevated CVD risk and are now U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved (113–116). Although none of these speciﬁcally target or have been tested explicitly in patients with CMD, the evidence reviewed previously suggests that one or more of these approaches may be beneﬁcial in CMD (Figure 6B). Patients with severe CMD and nonobstructive CAD (Figure 3, Box C) represent a potentially large number of patients with a clinically unmet need and an especially appealing phenotype for this approach (117). A common mechanism underlying IHD risk across patient subsets may involve

inﬂammation, endothelial dysfunction, and increased cardiomyocyte oxygen demand with ensuing microvascular ischemia, myocardial injury, and impaired cardiac mechanics. Thus, a clearer understanding of the relationship between CMD and CAD comorbid conditions, including insulin resistance and HFpEF, may guide development of novel systemic therapies to harness the beneﬁt of more “complete revascularization” in a manner not deﬁned by anatomy alone (Figure 6B).
CONCLUSIONS
CMD represents a combination of structural and functional abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation, is prevalent across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, and is associated with increased risk of MACE. Contemporary evidence supports that most patients with CMD have coexisting obstructive or nonobstructive atherosclerosis, with important implications for their prognosis. The interaction of CMD, CAD, and adverse outcomes, including heart failure, likely holds a key to novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular health promotion.
